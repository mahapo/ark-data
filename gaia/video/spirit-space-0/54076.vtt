00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.650 align:middle line:84%
-WHEN SOMEBODY ASKS YOU
WHAT YOU ARE,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.550 align:middle line:84%
YOU WILL SAY,
"WELL, I'M A HUMAN."

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:84%
BUT YOU SAY THAT
BECAUSE EVERYBODY AGREES

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:90%
THAT WHAT HUMAN REPRESENT.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:90%
"OH, I'M ENERGY. I'M LIGHT."

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%
BUT WHAT IS THE TRUTH?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE.
THAT'S TRUE.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
BUT DO YOU REALLY KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
-I HAVE WOKEN UP
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BODIES

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
WHERE I KNOW
I'M NOT IN MY OWN BODY,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:84%
WHERE I'M LOOKING THROUGH
ANOTHER PERSON'S EYES

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.090 align:middle line:84%
AND LOOKING OUT AT THE WORLD
THAT THEY SEE,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:90%
AND IT AIN'T ME THAT I'M SEEING.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
-WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT
50 YEARS AGO,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
WE COULDN'T EVEN THINK OF THIS
SORT OF STRANGE IDEA.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
30 YEARS AGO, YOU COULDN'T TALK
ABOUT IT OVER THE DINNER TABLE.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:90%
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
-YOU KNOW, YOU SET THE INTENTION
TO FIND SOMETHING

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:90%
AND TO ALIGN WITH SOMETHING,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
IT'S GONNA COME
INTO YOUR EXISTENCE.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:90%
-KNOWING THAT I AM A SOUL

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT
I INTERRELATE WITH ARE SOULS

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
COMPLETELY ALTERS MY PERSPECTIVE
OF HOW TO LIVE LIFE

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:90%
DAY BY DAY AND MOMENT BY MOMENT.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.759 align:middle line:84%
-HOW DO YOU GIVE THEM
THAT KNOWLEDGE,

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
OR HOW DO THEY COME TO KNOW FOR
THEMSELVES THAT THERE'S MORE?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
-I SEE A DUMBING DOWN
OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
IT'S A DUMBING DOWN
THAT I DO NOT THINK IS BEST.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.539 align:middle line:84%
I THINK IT IS APPEAL
TO OUR LOWEST NATURE

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
AS OPPOSED
TO OUR HIGHEST NATURE.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
-HUMANKIND, MANKIND,
CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF IS EVOLVING

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
INTO SOMETHING
THAT IT WASN'T BEFORE.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
AND WE'RE PART OF THAT.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
WE'RE ONE OF THOSE COGS
IN THE WHEEL

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
ON THE EVOLUTION
OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
-WHAT WE'RE EVOLVING INTO
IS WHAT WE --

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:90%
WHAT WE AS HUMAN BEINGS CREATE.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:90%
IT'S AN EVOLVING PROCESS.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
WE'RE IN A TOTAL PROCESS
THAT'S EVOLVING ALL THE TIME

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT WE ARE PART
OF THE CREATION OF IT.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
-AS ALL CIVILIZATIONS BEFORE US
HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
"WHO ARE WE?
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:84%
AND WHAT IS THIS
REALLY ALL ABOUT?"

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
OUR SCIENTIFIC COSMOLOGY
AT THAT POINT, AND EVEN TODAY,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
SUGGESTS THAT
IT'S ALL A COSMIC ACCIDENT.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
AND, OF COURSE, OPPOSING THAT
IS THE IDEALIST COSMOLOGY

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
WHICH SAYS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS
IS THE FUNDAMENTAL STUFF

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT ALL MATTER AROSE
FROM CONCEPTS AND CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
SO, HERE WE HAD WHAT SCIENCE
WAS TELLING US ABOUT OUR ORIGINS

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
AND OUR TRADITIONS, NORMALLY
OUR RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
-I DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN
SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGION.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
A RELIGION
IS WHEN A GROUP ENCODES

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:90%
CERTAIN BELIEFS AND TRADITIONS

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
AND AN INDIVIDUAL
IS EITHER BORN INTO THAT GROUP

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
OR JOINS THAT GROUP
AND ADOPTS THOSE BELIEFS

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
AND TRADITIONS FOR THEIR OWN.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
A PATH THAT'S SPIRITUAL
IS OFTEN MORE INDIVIDUAL

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT EVEN BE
A MEMBER OF A RELIGIOUS GROUP

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
BUT THEN
HAS A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:90%
SUCH AS A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
OR A PERSONAL, MYSTICAL
EXPERIENCE OF THE DIVINE.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN THE RELIGION
DOESN'T FIT ANYMORE.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN
THE RELIGION IS WRONG.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING
A MORE DIRECT EXPERIENCE

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
IN WHICH IT'S NOT SO MUCH
BELIEF ANYMORE

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
BUT AN ACTUAL KNOWING
OR WHAT I CALL FAITH.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
-ALWAYS MY INTEREST IN MAGIC
IS WHAT KEEPS ME GOING

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:84%
INTO THE STUDY
OF THE WEIRD STUFF

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
LIKE LIFE AFTER DEATH
AND WHO'S THE BIG G.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
IS THERE A BIG G, OR IS IT JUST
ALL A BIG LAW OF THE UNIVERSE

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:90%
THAT WE EXIST LIKE THIS?

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
-THEY PUT AN IMAGE OF GOD LIKE A
VERY OLD MAN WITH A LONG BEARD,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:84%
OR LIKE A HUMAN
WITH THE HEAD OF AN ELEPHANT.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:90%
YOU SEE ALL THOSE RELIGIONS

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
PROJECTS
WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS GOD.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:84%
AND OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S JUST MYTHOLOGY.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
EVEN THAT MYTHOLOGY,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
IT CAN PRETTY CLOSE REPRESENT
SOMETHING THAT WAS TRUE.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
AND NOW WHAT A RELIGION PROJECTS

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
IS IMAGES THAT HAVE NOTHING
TO DO REALLY WITH GOD.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
-WE ARE, IN TRUE NATURE,
SITTING AROUND A CAMPFIRE

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE LIGHT OF GOD
SHINING UPON US.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
BEHIND US IN THE FOREST
ARE DANCING SILHOUETTES

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
OF OUR PERSONS
SITTING AROUND THE FIRE OF GOD,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:90%
THE LIGHT OF GOD RADIATING.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:90%
AND IT IS THE SHADOWS,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.659 align:middle line:84%
THE SILHOUETTES
ON THE FOREST BEHIND US --

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
THOSE DANCING SILHOUETTES
ARE WHAT WE ARE NOW

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:90%
IN THE PHYSICAL BODY.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S NO SUBSTANCE TO THEM,
NO PERMANENCE TO THEM.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
THEY'RE JUST
DANCING SILHOUETTES.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
THE TRUE PERMANENT,
SOLID REALITY

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
IS US SITTING AROUND
THE LIGHT OF GOD.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
-THE BASIC MATTER,
THE FLESH, THE EMOTIONS,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
THE FEELINGS, NATURE
THAT WE HAVE AS HUMANS

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
IS NOT MARKEDLY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT ANIMALS HAVE.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
AND CERTAINLY WE SEE
THAT IN THE HIGHER PRIMATES

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
WHO ARE CLOSER TO US
IN NOT ONLY THEIR DNA,

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
BUT IN THEIR BEHAVIOR
AND THEIR SOCIAL BEHAVIOR

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:84%
AND THEIR INTERACTIONS
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
SO WE CANNOT ASSUME ANY LONGER
THAN WE'RE REALLY NOT ANIMALS,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE'RE APART FROM NATURE
IN THIS REGARD.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S JUST A --
THAT'S AN OLD MYTH.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:90%
IT'S UTTERLY WRONG.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:84%
WE CALL OUR INTUITIVE
CAPABILITIES OUR SIXTH SENSE,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT'S JUST DEAD WRONG.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
THEY SHOULD BE CALLED
OUR FIRST SENSE.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
WE HAVE BECOME MORE LEFT-BRAINED
AND SCREENED OUT

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
THESE INTUITIVE
RIGHT-BRAINED CAPABILITIES

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:90%
THAT SEEM TO BE NATURAL,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:84%
THAT SEEM TO BE A PART
OF OUR BASIC NATURE.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:90%
-IF WE GO BACK IN TIME

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
ANYWHERE BETWEEN
1,500 AND 2,000 YEARS --

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:90%
WE GO BACK IN TIME THAT FAR,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
WE DISCOVER THAT MOST CULTURES
OF THE WORLD WERE MYSTICAL.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
AND MYSTICAL MEANS
THAT THE SOUL HAS CONTINUITY.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:84%
MYSTICAL MEANS THAT WE EXIST
IN BODY AND WE EXIST IN SPIRIT.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
WHAT HAS HAPPENED
OVER THE LAST 1,500 YEARS

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT WE HAVE BECOME
VERY SCIENTIFIC,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:90%
WE NEED TO BE VERY GROUNDED,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
AND MANY GROUPS OF PEOPLE
HAVE LOST THE BELIEF STRUCTURE

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:90%
THAT THE SOUL HAS CONTINUITY

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
AND LIVES LIFETIME TO LIFETIME
AND IN BETWEEN LIFETIMES.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:84%
-BELIEF SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN
HANDED DOWN AND HANDED DOWN

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:90%
THROUGH THE AGES.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:84%
NOW YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
THROUGH WHAT WE DO, IN A WAY,

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
TO EXPLORE THAT, YOU KNOW,
LOOK INTO THAT BELIEF SYSTEM.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
CAN YOU TURN THAT BELIEF
INTO A KNOWN?

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
OR IS IT JUST A BELIEF SYSTEM?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
THE ONLY WAY YOU DO THAT
IS THROUGH EXPLORATION.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:90%
THAT IS THE KEY.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
-FROM SPACE, THE HEAVENS
ARE 10 TIMES AS BRIGHT

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE OF THE LACK
OF INTERVENING ATMOSPHERE.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
SO THAT MEANS 10 TIMES
AS NUMEROUS STARS.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:84%
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
AS I WAS LOOKING AT THAT...

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
AND AS I HAD LEARNED FROM
MY ASTRONOMY STUDIES AND MY --

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
MY ASTRONOMY STUDIES AT M.I.T
INCITED A UNITY,

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:90%
A CONNECTEDNESS TO ALL OF THAT.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE,

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
AN ECSTASY ACCOMPANIED
BY A BLISSFUL FEELING.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
AND THIS CONTINUED
WHEN I HAD A FEW MOMENTS

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:84%
TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
ALL THE WAY HOME FOR THREE DAYS.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:84%
AND [CLEARS THROAT] I REALIZED
I HAD TO UNDERSTAND

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:90%
WHAT THIS EXPERIENCE WAS.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS FAR BEYOND ANYTHING
I'D EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:90%
-33 1/2 HOURS AFTER THEY LANDED,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:90%
ALAN SHEPARD AND EDGAR MITCHELL

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
LIFTED OFF IN THE SILENT VACUUM
OF THE MOON.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:90%
-ENGINE IS ARMED.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
SIX...FIVE...FOUR...THREE...
TWO...ONE...ZERO.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
HOUSTON, WE HAVE IGNITION.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
-WHAT A LIFTOFF.
-AND LIFTOFF.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:90%
ROGER, IGNITION.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:90%
BOOM.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:90%
...10 SECONDS.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:90%
-ROGER.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:90%
HEY, BABY. IT'S GOING GOOD.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:84%
-IT'S PROBABLY
BEING MORE ACCEPTED TODAY

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE
ARE HAVING THESE EXPERIENCES

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:84%
OR AWAKENING
TO THESE EXPERIENCES

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:84%
AND ARE QUESTIONING
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK, AGAIN, THIS IS PART
OF THE EVOLVING PROCESS,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:90%
THAT EVERYTHING'S EVOLVING.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:84%
AND SO, WE'RE EVOLVING
INTO BECOMING MORE AWAKE

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
AND MORE CONSCIOUS
OF THE ENERGY OF WHO WE ARE.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:90%
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE OLD SAYING

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE'RE SPIRITUAL BEINGS
HAVING A HUMAN EXPERIENCE.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
-OF COURSE
THAT THE SOUL EXISTS.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
BUT PEOPLE MISINTERPRETED
WHAT IS SOUL.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:90%
THEY CREATE THAT IT'S A GHOST.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:90%
NO, IT'S NOT A GHOST.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:90%
THE SOUL IS A FORCE.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:84%
IT'S A FORCE THAT BEGINS
IN THE MOMENT OF CONCEPTION.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:84%
-SO, HERE WE HAD WHAT SCIENCE
WAS TELLING US ABOUT OUR ORIGINS

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:90%
AND OUR TRADITIONS,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
NORMALLY
OUR RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
COMING OUT OF OUR CULTURES,
TELLING US SOMETHING ELSE.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE TRUTH
WAS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT MAYBE WE NEEDED
TO REASK THESE QUESTIONS...

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:84%
...TO SEE IT FROM THE POINT
OF VIEW OF A SPACECRAFT

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:90%
MAYBE WITH SOME NEW ANSWERS.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:90%
-AAH!

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:90%
[ TIRES SCREECHING ]

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:90%
[ PEOPLE SCREAMING ]

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
-AND IT SEEMED TO BE
THAT THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:84%
WAS THE QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE
THAT WAS THE GREAT ENIGMA.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
WAS CONSCIOUSNESS
JUST ACCIDENTAL,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:90%
AS SCIENCE WOULD HAVE?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:90%
OR WAS IT THE FUNDAMENTAL STUFF,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
AS MOST CULTURAL IDEALIST
TRADITIONS WOULD HAVE?

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
-THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS TO FIND
SOME MEANINGFUL DEFINITION.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.220 align:middle line:84%
BY MEANINGFUL,
EITHER ONE THAT CAN BE

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATED
THROUGH SCIENCE,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:90%
OBJECTIVELY DEMONSTRATED.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
AND IF NOT THAT, AT LEAST
SOME MEANINGFUL DEFINITION

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
WHICH ALLOWS ONE FURTHER INSIGHT
INTO THE NATURE OF REALITY.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
-YOU'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
WHAT HAPPENS TO WHO I REALLY AM
IF I'M NOT IN THE PHYSICAL BODY?

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:90%
AND I WOULD SAY,

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PERSON
WHO IS HAVING A DREAM?

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DREAM

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU WAKE UP,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE THING
YOU WERE DURING THE DREAM?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:90%
IT JUST SORT OF VANISHES.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:90%
-WE'RE STUCK IN METAPHOR.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT'S WHERE
WE GET INTO ALL THIS TROUBLE

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE WE THINK OF IT
GOING SOMEWHERE.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
BUT HOW CAN IT GO
IF THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO?

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S NO -- I COULD SAY,
"WELL, MY CONSCIOUSNESS

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
"GOES FROM HERE
TO MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE,

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:90%
"AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GONNA BE.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
"THAT'S WHERE MY CONSCIOUSNESS
IS GONNA BE BURIED

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
"'CAUSE I LIKE
THE MEMPHIS BLUES.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
"OR MY CONSCIOUSNESS
GOES TO THE PLANET MARS

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE I ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE THERE."

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:90%
BUT IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY PLACE TO GO TO.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:90%
IT IS OMNIPRESENT.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
-IF WE STUDY THE CONCEPTS
PARTICULARLY OF HINDUISM

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:84%
AND OTHER BELIEF STRUCTURES
THAT ARE TIED TO THE SUFI BELIEF

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
AND THE ZOROASTRIAN
BELIEF STRUCTURE,

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN WE FIND
THAT THOSE BELIEF SYSTEMS

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:84%
BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT
BELIEVE THAT WE REMAIN IN BODY.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:90%
WHEN OUR SOUL DIES,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
OUR SOUL IS EXITED
OUT OF OUR BODIES

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
AND OUR SOULS WILL LIVE AGAIN
IN A BODY.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
-[ CHANTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ]

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
-THE EASTERN MYSTICAL
POINT OF VIEW

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
AND WHAT I THINK QUANTUM PHYSICS
IS SUGGESTING, TO ME, ANYWAY,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT
THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
THAT SOMEHOW MATTER
COMES OUT OF MIND

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:84%
RATHER THAN MIND
COMING OUT OF MATTER.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT CHANGES THINGS.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:90%
OR MAYBE BETTER PUT --

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
BOTH MIND AND MATTER
ARE DIFFERENT ILLUSIONS

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
OF THIS DEEPER REALITY WHICH IS
NEITHER MIND NOR MATTER,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:90%
BUT SOMEHOW BOTH.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
-SO, QUANTUM MECHANICS HAS BEEN
AROUND ALL OF THE 20th CENTURY.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
IT IS THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENT
OF THE 20th CENTURY

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
THAT HAS ALLOWED
MOST OF OUR PHYSICS TECHNOLOGY

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:84%
AND OUR NEW MODERN TECHNOLOGY
TO BE WHAT IT IS.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
IT ALSO ALLOWED
THE THINKERS OF THE PERIOD

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
TO REALIZE THAT
THE BODY/MIND WERE INTERACTIVE

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT MAYBE
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.290 align:middle line:84%
AT CONSCIOUSNESS
AFTER ALL WITHIN SCIENCE

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
WHEREAS BEFORE,
IT HAD BEEN CONSIDERED

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
THE REALM
OF THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:90%
-ONE OF THE CONCEPTS

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF
IS A NONLOCAL PHENOMENA.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:90%
THAT MEANS IN CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:84%
WE ARE UNIFIED EVERYWHERE,
EVERY WHEN.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
IT IS OUR FOCUS OF ATTENTION
OR OUR ALIGNMENT,

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO
IN ONE PARTICULAR MOMENT.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
RIGHT NOW, I'M PAYING ATTENTION
TO BEING IN THE BODY.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:90%
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
THAT I DON'T EXIST
EVERYWHERE, EVERY WHEN.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
ALL PARTICLES, ALL THINGS
HAVE THESE DUAL COMPONENTS --

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
A LOCAL MANIFESTATION
AND A NONLOCAL EXISTENCE.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
SO, PERHAPS, THEN, BEING MORE
THAN OUR PHYSICAL BODIES

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
IS IDENTIFYING
WITH PAYING ATTENTION

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
TO THAT NONLOCALNESS
OF WHO WE ARE.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:90%
-SO, EXISTENCE AND INFORMATION

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
ARE THE BASIS
NOT ONLY OF OUR BEING,

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
BUT OUR KNOWING,
WHY WE KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:84%
-SPIRIT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL
VIBRATION OF NOTHING.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:90%
BUT BY NOTHING,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN THE ABSOLUTE VOID
OUT OF WHICH EVERYTHING COMES.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
IT'S THE SPIRITUAL VACUUM,
IF YOU WILL,

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
THE VOID OUT OF WHICH
EVERYTHING ARISES.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
IT MAY BE RELATED
TO THE PHYSICAL VACUUM,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
WHICH WE KNOW IS CAPABLE OF,
ONCE BEING ENERGIZED,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:84%
OF PRODUCING PARTICLES
AND ANTI-PARTICLES,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
WHICH IS THE
PARTICLE/ANTI-PARTICLE CIRCUS

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
WHICH ARISES FROM PARTICLE
PHYSICS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE MIND, CONSCIOUSNESS --

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
THIS MYSTERIOUS ESSENCE
OF WHO WE ARE --

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
DOESN'T HAVE
A SPACE-TIME COORDINATION.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:90%
THE COMMON THOUGHT IS,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:29.370 align:middle line:84%
IT'S AS BIG AS THE BODY AND
IT LASTS AS LONG AS A LIFETIME.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
YOU'RE BORN, YOU LIVE,
AND THEN YOU DIE.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN YOUR BODY
DECAYS INTO DUST.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
AND BEFORE THAT, YOU WERE JUST
DUST AND EGGS AND WATER

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:84%
AND IT STARTS FERTILIZING
AND DNA AND [SPUTTERS]

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
AND ALL ELECTRICAL SPARKS
START FLYING

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:90%
AND PRETTY SOON THERE'S A FETUS,

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
AND THE FETUS BECOMES A BABY
AND ALL THAT.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
ALL OF THAT, YOU KNOW,
IS SOMEHOW THE NOTION

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:84%
THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS CONTAINED
WITHIN THE UNIT OF THE BODY.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:84%
-SO, BASICALLY,
WHEN OUR SOUL IS NEW,

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
WHEN OUR SOUL IS YOUNG,
IS BORN, WE MIGHT SAY,

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:90%
WE ARE ASSIGNED A SPIRIT GUIDE.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.280 align:middle line:84%
THAT GUIDE THEN WORKS WITH US
WHETHER WE'RE IN BODY,

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:90%
WHETHER WE'RE NOT IN BODY.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:90%
THAT GUIDE HAS HIGHER WISDOM,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
IS ALMOST ALWAYS
MORE EXPERIENCED

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:90%
AS A SOUL THAN WE ARE --

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
SOMETIMES DRAMATICALLY
MORE EXPERIENCED,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
SOMETIMES ONLY MINIMALLY
MORE EXPERIENCED

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY
WE PROGRESS.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:84%
-I FEEL THAT EACH OF US
HAS A GROUP OF GUIDES

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
THAT ASSISTS US AND HELPS US
IN OUR DAILY LIFE.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:90%
HOWEVER, MY CLIENTS TELL ME

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:84%
THAT THEY OFTEN MEET
A MASTER TEACHER GUIDE

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
IN THEIR
LIFE-BETWEEN-LIFE EXPERIENCE

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:84%
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR OVERSEEING

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.960 align:middle line:84%
THEIR SOUL'S PROGRESS
FROM EMBODIMENT TO EMBODIMENT.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:90%
AND THIS GUIDE MAY OR MAY NOT BE

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
INTIMATELY INVOLVED
WITH THEIR DAILY LIFE

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
BUT IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR OVERSEEING THEIR PROGRESS

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:90%
OVER MANY, MANY LIFETIMES.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
-WE CAN'T SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE
ANY OF THIS STUFF, OF COURSE.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT'S WHERE ANYBODY
WHO'S SCIENTIFICALLY

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
AND LOGICALLY
AND RATIONALLY MINDED

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
WILL DISMISS ALL THIS AS BEING,
"EH."

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S NOT
SCIENTIFICALLY PROVABLE,

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:90%
IT DOESN'T EXIST.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:84%
OF COURSE, YOU HAVE
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
THAT MOST OF THE THINGS
WE DO IN LIFE

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:90%
ARE NOT SCIENTIFICALLY PROVABLE.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
IN FACT, THE STUFF IN LIFE
WHICH IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVABLE

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
IS PROBABLY LESS THAN 10%
OF EVERYTHING WE DO.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:84%
BUT YET, WE RELY
ON SCIENTIFIC PROVABILITY

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
AS BEING MUCH, YOU KNOW,
IMPORTANCE IN OUR LIFE.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:90%
WE LOOK AT ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:84%
AND THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT
RIGHT NOW --

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:90%
DEATH EXPERIENCES,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
CHILDREN THAT ARE BORN
WITH MEMORIES OF AUNTS OR UNCLES

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
OR EVEN GRANDPARENTS
THAT HAD DIED

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:84%
YEARS BEFORE
THE CHILD WAS EVEN BORN.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S MANY CASES
OF THIS IN INDIA,

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
OF SO-CALLED
REINCARNATION MEMORIES.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I DON'T KNOW.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:90%
IF YOU READ THESE ACCOUNTS,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
THEY SEEM TO BE
PRETTY SENSIBLE TO ME.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
-AND THAT HAS ALLOWED US NOW
TO TAKE QUANTUM PHYSICS

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
AND START TO EXPLORE IT
IN QUITE A NEW WAY

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS
AND TO OPEN BRAND-NEW DOORS

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
THAT HAVE
NEVER BEEN OPENED BEFORE

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:90%
IN UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES,

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
IN UNDERSTANDING
THE DEEPEST REALMS OF BIONATURE,

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
AND UNDERSTANDING
CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
-I HAVE WOKEN UP
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BODIES.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:90%
NOW, THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
WHERE I KNOW
I'M NOT IN MY OWN BODY,

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
WHERE I'M LOOKING THROUGH
ANOTHER PERSON'S EYES

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
AND LOOKING OUT AT THE WORLD
THAT THEY SEE,

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:90%
AND IT AIN'T ME THAT I'M SEEING.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
IT AIN'T MY WORLD
THAT I'M LOOKING AT.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
ONE TIME [CHUCKLES] I WOKE UP,
GOT OUT OF BED,

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:90%
WENT TO TAKE A WHIZ.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:84%
AND I WALK INSIDE
IN THE BATHROOM IN MY LOG CABIN,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:84%
STOOD OVER THE TOILET,
JUST ABOUT TO PEE,

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
AND SUDDEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T
GO TO SLEEP IN A LOG CABIN.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:90%
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.500 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S NO LOG CABIN
WHERE I WAS.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING
IN A LOG CABIN?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
I WAS IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S BODY.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
HE WAS WHIZZING,
AND I WAS THERE WATCHING.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:84%
-MORE AND MORE,
MAINSTREAM AMERICA, IF YOU WILL,

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
ARE OPENING
TO THESE TYPE OF EXPERIENCES

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE
ARE NOW HAVING THEM

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
OR RECOGNIZING THEY'RE HAVING IT
AND BEING AWAKE TO HAVING IT.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I THINK
THERE'S A COMING TOGETHER OF,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:84%
LET'S SAY,
SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALITY.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
IT SEEMS THAT IT'S MORE
OF A COMING TOGETHER OF THAT.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN I SAY SPIRITUALITY,
NOT NECESSARILY RELIGION.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:84%
MY FATHER
WAS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
IN NEW YORK BACK IN
THE LATE '40s, EARLY '50s.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:84%
HE WAS THE PRODUCER
OF OVER 50 RADIO SHOWS.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
AND BEING THE LEFT-BRAINED,
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN HE WAS,

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
WHEN HE STARTED HAVING THESE
OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCES,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
HE REALLY QUESTIONED WHAT AND
WHY WAS THIS HAPPENING TO HIM.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:90%
WHAT WAS THIS OUT-OF-BODY STATE?

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
SO HE LOOKED TO WESTERN SCIENCE
TO GIVE HIM THE ANSWER,

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
WHICH IS HOW WE CAME UP WITH
THE PROCESS KNOWN AS HEMI-SYNC,

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:90%
WHICH IS A SOUND TECHNOLOGY.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
AND IN USING CERTAIN FREQUENCIES
IN THE SOUND TECHNOLOGY,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
COMBINATIONS
OF CERTAIN FREQUENCIES,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:90%
WE'RE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
MOVE INTO THESE DIFFERENT STATES
OF CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%
DIFFERENT STATES OF AWARENESS.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:90%
-WE HAVE MEANS THAT PEOPLE KNOW

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
THEY ARE MORE
THAN THEIR PHYSICAL BODY.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
AND KNOWING YOU ARE MORE
THAN YOUR PHYSICAL BODY

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
IS THE BEGINNING OF KNOWING
THAT YOU SURVIVE PHYSICAL DEATH.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:84%
-HE INFLUENCED
A LOT OF THINKING.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.450 align:middle line:90%
AND BECAUSE OF HIS BOOKS,

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
A LOT OF PEOPLE BEGAN
TO EXPERIMENT

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%
WITH OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:90%
I THINK I GOT INFLUENCED BY IT

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IT NO LONGER
BECAME SOMETHING

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
THE PROBLEM IS, UNTIL SOMEBODY
LIKE ROBERT MONROE

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:90%
STEPS INTO THE WORLD AND SAYS,

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:84%
"THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS,"

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:90%
PEOPLE DON'T TRY TO DO IT.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:90%
IT MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:84%
BUT THEY DON'T --
IT'S LIKE A BLUR.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:90%
YOU DON'T SEE IT.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS,
"AH, THIS IS THAT,"

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:84%
THEN YOU BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE IT
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
-THE ABILITY TO TUNE INTO
THIS CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
TO BECOME AWARE
OF YOUR OUT-OF-BODY STATE,

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I THINK, IS THE TRUE QUESTION.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:90%
IT'S NOT, "WHO HAS THE ABILITY

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
TO GET OUT OF THEIR BODY
AND WHO DOESN'T?"

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
IT'S WHO BECOMES AWARE, WHO HAS
THE ABILITY TO BECOME AWARE.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:90%
-I THINK THE VERY FIRST TIME,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I WAS FLOATING ABOVE MY BODY
AND I WAS NEAR THE CEILING.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:84%
AND I COULD SEE THE CEILING
VERY CLEARLY.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
AND I TURNED --
OR, I KIND OF, LIKE,

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:84%
STARTED TO FEEL MYSELF
DRAWING DOWN.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER I WAS AFRAID

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:84%
OR DIDN'T KNOW HOW FAR I WAS UP
OR HOW HIGH I WAS GONNA GO

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:84%
OR WHETHER
I'D GO THROUGH THE CEILING.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I DON'T KNOW.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:84%
SOME FEAR MECHANISM
PROBABLY DROVE ME BACK DOWN.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:90%
WHEN I GOT BACK DOWN AGAIN,

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I REMEMBER TRYING TO GET MY HAND
INSIDE OF MY BODY.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:90%
IT'S LIKE MY BODY WAS A GLOVE

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:84%
AND I COULDN'T GET MY HAND
TO FIT INSIDE MY THUMBS.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:84%
EVERYTHING WAS A LITTLE BIT,
YOU KNOW,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:90%
HELTER SKELTER FOR A WHILE.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
AND FINALLY I FINALLY
GOT MY LITTLE FINGER

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
INTO THE LITTLE FINGER SPACE
AND EVERYTHING KIND OF FIT IN.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I FINALLY -- I FIT IN.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
-AND WHEN ASTRAL PROJECTION
IS HAPPENING,

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:84%
THE QUESTION
I WOULD PERSONALLY WONDER IS,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:90%
"THE SOUL THAT'S INCARNATE

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:84%
"WHO IS EXPERIENCING
THE ASTRAL PROJECTION,

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
"ARE THEY PROJECTING
INTO THE SPIRITUAL REALM

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:84%
"OR ARE THEY PROJECTING
INTO THE SPACE

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
"THAT I BELIEVE EXISTS
CLOSER TO EARTH

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.180 align:middle line:84%
"AND THE SPACE
THAT IS BETWEEN BEING INCARNATE

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:84%
"AND BEING FULLY
IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:84%
AND WHAT WE EXPERIENCE IN
LIFE-BETWEEN-LIVES REGRESSION?"

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
-THE ONLY THING
WE ASK YOU TO CONSIDER

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.700 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT YOU ARE MORE
THAN YOUR PHYSICAL BODY.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:90%
JUST CONSIDER THAT.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:84%
AND THROUGH THAT,
THE HEMI-SYNC TECHNOLOGY

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.740 align:middle line:84%
HELPS YOU REALLY MOVE
INTO KNOWING THAT --

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:90%
NOT JUST BELIEVING IT.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:84%
BUT BECAUSE IT'S ABLE TO PUT YOU
INTO A RELAXED STATE --

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
FIRST OF ALL,
THAT'S THE KEY OF ANYTHING

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
IS TO MOVE INTO
A TOTALLY RELAXED STATE.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.580 align:middle line:90%
AND ONCE YOU'RE THERE,

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:84%
YOU BEGIN TO OPEN UP AND EXPAND
INTO THE ENERGY THAT YOU ARE,

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
WHICH IS MORE
THAN YOUR PHYSICAL BODY.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:84%
-AND WE'VE KNOWN
FOR YEARS AND YEARS

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:84%
THAT WHEN YOU CAN BE IN THAT
VERY DEEPLY RELAXED PLACE,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
THEN, YOU KNOW,
WE LET GO OF OUR DEFENSES,

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
WE LET GO
OF BLOCKS AND OBSTACLES

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
THAT PERHAPS
GET IN THE WAY OF EXPLORING.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:84%
AND SO, FROM THAT PLACE
OF DEEP RELAXATION

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:84%
THEN WE CAN OPEN UP
TO ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:84%
-ANCIENT CULTURES
HAVE BEEN DOING THIS

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.560 align:middle line:84%
THROUGH RHYTHMIC DRUMMING,
THROUGH DANCE,

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:84%
AND THROUGH CHANTING
AND RITUALS

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
IN MANY, MANY, MANY CULTURES.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:84%
THE TECHNOLOGY OF STEREO
AND DOLBY DIGITAL SURROUND SOUND

00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:84%
IS SOMETHING NEW
TO THE 20th AND 21st CENTURY.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.240 align:middle line:84%
WE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO USE
THAT MODERN-DAY TECHNOLOGY

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
TO DO WHAT CULTURES HAVE BEEN
DOING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
WE USE AN AUDIO GUIDANCE SYSTEM
TO ALTER BRAIN-WAVE STATES

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:84%
ACCOMPANIED BY
RELAXATION PROCEDURES,

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:90%
MEDITATIVE PROCEDURES

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.370 align:middle line:84%
THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO DEVELOP
AN AWARENESS OF INFORMATION

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
AND CONCEPTS NOT ORDINARY
TO OUR WAKING STATE.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS THE BRIDGE
FOR OPENING --

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:84%
OPENING A GATEWAY
FOR THE OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:90%
-THE OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE,

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.280 align:middle line:84%
THE CLASSICAL KIND
OF OUT-OF-BODY

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
THAT OTHERS MIGHT CALL
ASTRAL PROJECTION

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR SOME PEOPLE
AND MAY OCCUR FOR SOME PEOPLE.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
BUT IT'S JUST ONE PIECE
OF A WHOLE RANGE

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:84%
OF POSSIBLE EXPERIENCES
THAT WOULD BE USEFUL

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
IN HELPING ONE TO COME
TO KNOW BETTER THEIR TOTAL SELF.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:90%
-WELL, DEATH IS THE BIG UNFOCUS.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:90%
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:90%
LETTING GO.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:90%
SUDDENLY, ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.800 align:middle line:84%
WHICH WERE SO IMPORTANT TO YOU
ALMOST YOUR WHOLE LIFE

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
WILL, IN A FLASH,
BE TOTALLY UNIMPORTANT TO YOU.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:90%
IT MAY TAKE A COUPLE DAYS --

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
BEFORE YOU FINALLY RECOGNIZE

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:84%
THAT YOU'RE NOT
THAT BODY ANYMORE

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.780 align:middle line:90%
OR YOU'RE NOT EVEN CONCERNED

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE WHOLE LIFE-AND-DEATH
DRAMA OF THAT LIFETIME.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:84%
-AND IN THE MOMENT
OF YOUR DEATH,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
THAT FORCE, THE SOUL
AND LET GO EVERYTHING.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:05.360 align:middle line:84%
NO LONGER RECOGNIZE
ANY PIECE OF YOU ANYMORE.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:90%
BUT THE SOUL COME FROM LIFE,

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:84%
WHICH BREATHE FROM SPIRIT
FROM GOD.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:84%
-ESSENTIALLY, OUR SOUL IS WAVES
OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:90%
OUR SOUL IS ENERGY.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.810 align:middle line:84%
AND SO,
WHEN OUR SOUL IS RELEASED

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.450 align:middle line:90%
OUT OF OUR PHYSICAL BODY,

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS
THE ENERGY VIBRATIONS HEIGHTEN

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
SO THAT OUR SOUL
IS ABLE TO LEAVE OUR BODY.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:84%
AND OUR BODY IS VERY DENSE
AND LOW IN A VIBRATIONAL NATURE.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN OUR SOUL LEAVES
AT THE POINT OF DEATH,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.840 align:middle line:84%
THOSE ENERGY VIBRATIONS
WE MIGHT SAY SPEED UP.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:50.980 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT'S HOW THE SOUL
IS RELEASED OUT OF THE BODY.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.340 align:middle line:84%
-WHEN A PERSON GOES THROUGH
THEIR OWN DEATH

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:90%
IN A PAST-LIFE REGRESSION,

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
IT'S USUALLY VERY EASY FOR THEM
TO LEAVE THEIR BODY

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:84%
AND TO REALIZE
THAT THEY'VE DIED.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.250 align:middle line:90%
I ALWAYS TAKE A MOMENT

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
FOR THEM TO REFLECT
ON THE LIFE THEY'VE JUST LEFT.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.890 align:middle line:84%
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING
EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
TO REALIZE THAT THEY'RE NOT
REALLY THAT BODY.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:84%
THEY ALMOST ALWAYS
ARE ABOVE THE BODY LOOKING DOWN.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:84%
THEY CAN SEE THE PEOPLE
IN THE ROOM,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:84%
IF THEIR WIFE OR HUSBAND
IS CRYING OVER THE BODY.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.770 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY ALMOST ALWAYS
DESCRIBE A SENSE OF RELIEF

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT IT'S EASIER FOR THEM
TO HAVE PASSED OVER

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:90%
THAN FOR THE PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S
INTERESTING FOR US TO REMEMBER

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:84%
WHEN SOMEONE HAS DIED
THAT'S CLOSE TO US,

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE'RE USUALLY GOING THROUGH
MUCH MORE TRAUMA THAN THEY ARE.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:90%
AND ALMOST ALWAYS,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S IMMEDIATELY A SENSE
OF RELIEF AND PEACE,

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:84%
AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE BEEN
ILL OR IN ANY PAIN.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
-I HAVE LEARNED TO EXPERIENCE
DEATH IN A PEACEFUL WAY.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:02.680 align:middle line:84%
WHERE IF I WAS ASKED
THAT QUESTION SIX, SEVEN,

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.080 align:middle line:90%
EIGHT YEARS AGO,

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT IT
IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LIGHT

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
WITH A LOT OF FEAR OF
THE UNKNOWN AND WHAT TO EXPECT.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.130 align:middle line:84%
-WE ARE LIVING
IN A PHYSICAL BODY

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:90%
THAT IS ALIVE BECAUSE OF US.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.100 align:middle line:84%
WE GIVE LIFE
TO THIS PHYSICAL BODY.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:90%
-WARNING. OVERLOAD.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:84%
-MIND EXISTS BECAUSE
WE GIVE LIFE TO THAT MIND.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:84%
WITHOUT US, THE PHYSICAL BODY
WILL DISAPPEAR,

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:84%
WILL BECOME DUST,
AND THE MIND WILL BE DISSOLVED.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:90%
WHAT WE REALLY ARE IS LIFE.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:84%
AND LIFE IS ETERNAL.
IT NEVER ENDS.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.760 align:middle line:84%
IT NEVER BEGINS,
BUT IS SHIFTING, IS GROWING,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.830 align:middle line:84%
IS TRANSFORMING, AND THAT
IS NOTHING BUT TRANSFORMATION,

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:00.040 align:middle line:84%
IS OURSELF GETTING
OUT OF THAT PHYSICAL BODY,

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:84%
OURSELF GETTING OUT OF THAT
MIND, OF THAT WORLD OF ILLUSION.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:84%
-THINK OF IT AS WHEN
YOU'RE LOOKING THROUGH A LENS

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:84%
OR A TELESCOPE
OR A PAIR OF BINOCULARS.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU LOOK THROUGH IT,
THE IMAGE IS SHARP.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S CALL FOCUSED.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
AS YOU TURN THE DIALS,
THEY START TO GET BLURRY.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.929 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S CALL DE-FOCUSING
OR UNFOCUSING.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:27.199 align:middle line:84%
NOW, AN UNFOCUSED IMAGE IS THAT
THE LIGHT FROM THE OBJECT

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
IS GOING THROUGH
MANY DIFFERENT PATHWAYS

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.699 align:middle line:84%
TO REACH YOUR EYE
SO THAT YOUR EYE

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.370 align:middle line:84%
IS GETTING THE LIGHT
FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:84%
ALL AT THE SAME TIME
AND IT APPEARS BLURRY.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:90%
SO, IF YOU THINK OF IT,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:84%
IT'S A GOOD ANALOGY
TO PARALLEL REALITIES.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:90%
PARALLEL REALITIES,

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
YOU'RE SEEING ALL THE REALITIES
COMING THROUGH AT ONCE

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:84%
RATHER THAN A SINGLE REALITY,
A SINGLE FOCUSED REALITY.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:52.290 align:middle line:84%
AND THESE TWO PROCESSES,
FOCUSING AND DE-FOCUSING,

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:90%
ARE THINGS THAT WE DO NATURALLY

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:84%
AS WE BEGIN TO LEARN NEW THINGS
AND AS WE BEGIN TO LET GO

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.200 align:middle line:84%
OF OLD WAYS OF THINKING SO
WE CAN LEARN NEW THINGS AGAIN.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.600 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS SORT OF
THE PROCESS OF LIFE.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:90%
-A NEWLY DECEASED SPIRIT IS,

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
YES, VERY AWARE
OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
IT MAY TAKE TIME
FOR THAT NEWLY DECEASED SPIRIT

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:84%
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE,
IN FACT, DIED.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:84%
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN THE NEWLY DECEASED SPIRIT

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.060 align:middle line:90%
REMAINS CLOSE TO THE BODY,

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:28.390 align:middle line:84%
TO THE BODY THAT THEY'VE JUST
BEEN RELEASED FROM.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT SPIRIT MAY HOVER CLOSE
FOR A FAIR LENGTH OF TIME --

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.270 align:middle line:90%
COULD BE HOURS, COULD BE DAYS --

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:84%
BOTH RECOGNIZING
WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOR THE SPIRIT

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:44.710 align:middle line:84%
AND TAKING CARE OF WHAT I MIGHT
CALL UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
IT REMINDS ME
OF A STORY OF A CLIENT,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:90%
A SOLDIER, A YOUNG SOLDIER,

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
I THINK 18 OR 20 YEARS OLD
WHEN HE DIED IN WAR.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WAS VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT HIS MOTHER.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.520 align:middle line:90%
SO HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:84%
ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH
AND COMFORT HIS MOTHER

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:90%
BEFORE HE WAS READY TO MOVE ON.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.400 align:middle line:90%
AND THE QUESTION WE ALWAYS ASK

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
IN A LIFE-BETWEEN-LIVES
REGRESSION IS,

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.240 align:middle line:84%
"SO, HOW DO YOU DO
THIS COMMUNICATING?

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:84%
"HOW DO YOU
ENERGETICALLY CONNECT

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
WITH SOMEONE
THAT REMAINS INCARNATE?"

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:20.210 align:middle line:84%
AND THE DESCRIPTIONS
ARE FASCINATING AT TIMES.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.780 align:middle line:90%
THE SOUL WILL SAY,

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.120 align:middle line:84%
"I SEND ENERGY
INTO THE HEART OF MY MOTHER."

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.180 align:middle line:90%
AND THE INTERESTING PART IS,

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:84%
SOMETIMES WHAT'S SAID
IS THAT THE LOVED ONE

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.530 align:middle line:84%
THAT STILL REMAINS IN BODY
RECOGNIZES THE COMMUNICATION

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.730 align:middle line:84%
AND SOMETIMES
THERE'S LACK OF RECOGNITION.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:84%
AND I WOULD HOPE
THAT THROUGH INFORMATION

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:90%
SUCH AS WHAT I'M SHARING

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.240 align:middle line:84%
THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
WOULD COME TO ACCEPT

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:84%
THAT THEIR LOVED ONES
ABSOLUTELY VERY OFTEN

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:84%
ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE AND
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY'RE FINE.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:84%
-I HAD PASSED AWAY.
IT WAS A VERY PEACEFUL DEATH.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:90%
I HAD MY FAMILY AROUND ME.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN, THAT LIFE WAS KIND OF
A QUIET LIFE, A LONELY LIFE.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.330 align:middle line:90%
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF FAMILY.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:90%
AND AS I LOOKED DOWN AT IT,

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I FELT VERY CALM AND PEACEFUL
AND SPIRITUAL.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.610 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN I EXPERIENCED A LIGHT.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT AND THEN
KIND OF A PURPLISH LIGHT.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:84%
AND I WAS JUST KIND OF
FLOATING ALONG.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:84%
AND AS I FLOATED ALONG, I WAS
GREETED BY MY SPIRIT GUIDE.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:90%
AND HIS NAME WAS PETER

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WAS WEARING
A WHITE FLOWING ROBE,

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
HAD A GOLD CORD WRAPPED
AROUND IT, WITH LONG HAIR,

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:84%
APPEARED TO BE AN OLDER PERSON,
VERY CALMING AND VERY OPEN.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:90%
AND I WAS THEN GUIDED ALONG

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:84%
UNTIL I SAW A BUILDING,
A STRUCTURE.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.250 align:middle line:90%
WHAT I SAW WAS COLUMNS.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.450 align:middle line:90%
AND IT WAS A BIG HALL.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
AND IN THE HALL, THERE WAS
MOSAICS ON THE WALL, ONE WALL,

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:90%
AND TAPESTRY ON THE OTHER --

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.670 align:middle line:84%
JUST A HUGE HALL
WITH REAL TALL CEILINGS.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:90%
-IT IS STILL THE GREAT MYSTERY.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.770 align:middle line:90%
WHAT IS IT THAT'S ONGOING?

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.740 align:middle line:90%
WHAT IS IT THAT SURVIVES?

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.140 align:middle line:90%
WELL, CERTAINLY OUR RECENT WORK

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.750 align:middle line:84%
SHOWS THAT
THE INFORMATION SURVIVES,

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE INFORMATION
IN HOLOGRAPHIC FORM

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:84%
THAT NATURE PRESERVES
IN THIS QUANTUM HOLOGRAM

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.960 align:middle line:90%
IS A RECORD OF OUR LIFE.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.460 align:middle line:84%
AND IN ANCIENT LORE,
THEY RECOGNIZED THIS, AS WELL,

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:84%
BUT THEY CALLED IT
THE AKASHIC RECORD.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.700 align:middle line:84%
THE AKASHIC RECORD
IS THE RECORD OF LIFE

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.540 align:middle line:84%
AND WAS RECOGNIZED VERY WELL
BY THE ANCIENTS.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.140 align:middle line:90%
WE ARE NOW STARTING TO SEE THAT,

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.780 align:middle line:84%
AND WE CALL IT
THE ZERO POINT ENERGY FIELD

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:84%
WITH ITS QUANTUM HOLOGRAM
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF --

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.280 align:middle line:90%
OR IS LIKE THE AKASHIC RECORD

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.890 align:middle line:84%
OR THEY'RE KIND OF
ONE AND THE SAME.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I DO NOT DENY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS
MAY BE THE FUNDAMENTAL STUFF.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:84%
BUT I DON'T FIND -- DON'T THINK
YOU'RE VERY GOING TO BE ABLE

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.270 align:middle line:90%
TO PROVE THAT DIRECTLY.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:90%
IN OTHER WORDS,

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THE
UNIVERSE BY OUR NORMAL MATERIAL,

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:84%
NATURAL MEANS THE WAY WE ARE
TRYING TO DO SO,

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.750 align:middle line:90%
THEN IN DUE COURSE,

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:84%
YOU HAVE TO FALL BACK
ON THE SUPERNATURAL.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
THIS MOMENT,
I'M NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:84%
-YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FEAR DEATH
BECAUSE --

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:84%
AND, AGAIN,
IF YOU EXPERIENCE IT,

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF THAT
YOU SURVIVE PHYSICAL DEATH.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.740 align:middle line:84%
AND NOT JUST BELIEVE IT --
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE IT.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.840 align:middle line:90%
AND WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE IT,

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.240 align:middle line:84%
THEN YOU KNOW
THAT YOU SURVIVE PHYSICAL DEATH.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.610 align:middle line:90%
MY FATHER HAD NO FEAR OF DEATH.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.450 align:middle line:84%
MY FATHER, BECAUSE OF
SO MANY EXPERIENCES HE HAD,

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.820 align:middle line:90%
HE KNEW THAT HE SURVIVED DEATH.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:90%
HE DIDN'T JUST BELIEVE IT.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.160 align:middle line:84%
HE KNEW IT
BECAUSE HE HAD EXPERIENCED IT.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.390 align:middle line:84%
THE KEY IS FOR YOU
TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
-AND WE FIND THAT PEOPLE

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.970 align:middle line:84%
MAY BE VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE TERRITORY.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.540 align:middle line:90%
ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE BODY

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.810 align:middle line:84%
AND HAVE KIND OF
SAID THEIR FAREWELLS,

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.550 align:middle line:84%
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
THEY'RE GOING AND GO THERE.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.280 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY'RE NOT MET BY ANYONE
AT ALL, BUT THEY'RE NOT LONELY.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.920 align:middle line:84%
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MET
BY A WHOLE SOUL GROUP

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.790 align:middle line:90%
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A PARTY,

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.660 align:middle line:84%
LIKE THEY'VE GOT A BIG
"WELCOME HOME" PARTY

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.160 align:middle line:90%
AND IT'S VERY FESTIVE.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.770 align:middle line:90%
[ CHILD LAUGHING ]

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:84%
-AND THAT SPACE
IN BETWEEN THE PLANETS

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
IS WHAT THE TOLTECS CALLED
THE NAGUAL.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
NOW, WHAT GIVES LIFE
TO THE NAGUAL, WHICH IS LIGHT,

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:36.030 align:middle line:84%
AND WHAT GIVE LIFE TO THE TONAL,
WHICH IS MATTER,

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.500 align:middle line:90%
IS WHAT THEY CALL INTENT.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.770 align:middle line:84%
AND INTENT IS A FORCE
THAT MOVES EVERYTHING

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:90%
AND PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.340 align:middle line:90%
I CALL IT LIFE.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:52.410 align:middle line:84%
THE TOLTECS KNOW THAT THE SPACE
IN BETWEEN PLANETS

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.040 align:middle line:90%
WAS NOT EMPTY.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.510 align:middle line:90%
IT'S FULL OF LIGHT.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.780 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S NO SPACE
IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.590 align:middle line:84%
OF CHANGE, OF UNIVERSE,
WHO IS EMPTY.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.190 align:middle line:84%
IN BETWEEN ATOMS,
IN BETWEEN STARS,

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:84%
IN BETWEEN PLANETS,
ALWAYS EXISTS LIGHT.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:90%
-WHAT THE QUANTUM HOLOGRAM IS,

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.840 align:middle line:84%
IT'S BASED ON
THE WELL-KNOWN FACT

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:84%
THAT MATTER EMITS
AND REABSORBS QUANTA OF ENERGY,

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:84%
PHOTONS, AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL
OF NATURE,

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:35.550 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT THOSE PHOTONS
HAVE A NONLOCAL INTERCONNECTION

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.420 align:middle line:84%
REGARDLESS
OF WHERE THEY GO THEREAFTER.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:90%
THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:46.330 align:middle line:84%
TAKE THE QUANTUM EMISSIONS
FROM ANY BODY OF MATTER,

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.970 align:middle line:84%
FROM A HUMAN TO A CHAIR
TO ANYTHING.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.300 align:middle line:90%
YOU STUDY IT AS A GROUP,

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.670 align:middle line:84%
IT IS CARRYING
UNIQUE INFORMATION

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
IN THE EVENT HISTORY
OF THAT OBJECT.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:00.910 align:middle line:90%
WOW.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS
A RATHER FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:07.280 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IT IS SAYING
THAT INFORMATION

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.690 align:middle line:90%
AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL IN NATURE

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.790 align:middle line:84%
IS AS IMPORTANT
AS ENERGY ITSELF.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.230 align:middle line:90%
WHAT THE PHYSICISTS TELL US

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT WHEN PARTICLES
ARE ENTANGLED

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:23.900 align:middle line:84%
POSTHUMOUS
AT THE SUBATOMIC LEVEL

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY GO ACROSS THE UNIVERSE
FROM EACH OTHER, SHOULD THEY,

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.810 align:middle line:84%
THEY MAINTAIN A CORRELATION,
A COHERENCE.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.550 align:middle line:84%
AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO ONE PARTICLE,

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:40.250 align:middle line:84%
IT IS INSTANTANEOUSLY KNOWN
OR RECOGNIZED

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.750 align:middle line:90%
BY THE OTHER PARTICLES

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.790 align:middle line:84%
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE
IN THE UNIVERSE.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:47.020 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S INSTANTANEOUS
COMMUNICATION.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S CALLED NONLOCALITY.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.160 align:middle line:84%
-HOW WOULD ONE EXPERIENCE THAT
SUBJECTIVELY?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.130 align:middle line:84%
WHAT IS YOUR SUBJECTIVE
EXPERIENCE OF NONLOCALITY?

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.340 align:middle line:84%
MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IT
AS AN OUT-OF-BODY STATE,

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:90%
AN OUT-OF-BODY SITUATION.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:90%
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.140 align:middle line:84%
WHEN WE THINK OF
A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE,

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:84%
PEOPLE SEEM TO FLOAT OUT
OR PERCEIVE THEMSELVES

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.420 align:middle line:84%
TO BE SOME WAY DISTANT
FROM THE PHYSICAL BODY.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:90%
THE QUESTION COMES UP,

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.290 align:middle line:84%
IS THERE THEN A SEPARATE BODY
OR A SECOND BODY?

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:21.160 align:middle line:84%
MANY PEOPLE HAVE A PHILOSOPHIC
OPINION THAT THERE IS,

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.130 align:middle line:84%
THAT THERE IS A SPIRIT BODY
OR A SOUL.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:84%
THE PHYSICISTS
WOULD REFLECT BACK AND SAY,

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:34.340 align:middle line:84%
"WELL, WE DON'T HAVE ANY
MEASUREMENT OR PROOF OF THAT."

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:38.540 align:middle line:84%
SO THE IN-BETWEEN ROAD
MIGHT BE A HABIT.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I'M IN THE HABIT
OF FEELING MYSELF IN THIS BODY.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.520 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN
I BECOME NONLOCALLY AWARE,

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:84%
A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE
OR AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE,

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:84%
AS A HABIT,
I THINK I HAVE A BODY.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.030 align:middle line:90%
BUT PERHAPS IT REALLY ISN'T.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.330 align:middle line:90%
PERHAPS I AM MORE THAN THAT,

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.230 align:middle line:84%
MORE THAN THE CONCEPTS
OF A BODY.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.430 align:middle line:84%
IF WE CAN BECOME AWARE
OF INFORMATION

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.570 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE
TO THE PHYSICAL SENSES,

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.910 align:middle line:84%
IT'S AVAILABLE ONLY IF
WE ARE NONLOCALLY AWARE,

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:13.240 align:middle line:84%
SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE,
SOMETHING IN THE PAST,

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:84%
SOMETHING
DISTANT IN SPACE FROM US,

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.780 align:middle line:84%
SOMETHING THAT WE COULDN'T KNOW
WITH OUR PHYSICAL SENSES,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.290 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT INFORMATION
COMES TO US,

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.950 align:middle line:90%
THEREIN LIES THE PROOF.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.760 align:middle line:84%
HOW ELSE
COULD WE POSSIBLY KNOW THIS

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.360 align:middle line:84%
BUT THAT WE WERE MORE THAN
OUR PHYSICAL BODIES?

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:90%
-IN QUANTUM PHYSICS,

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.200 align:middle line:84%
NOT ONLY IS IT NOT CONSIDERED
TO BE CRAZY,

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.300 align:middle line:84%
IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE A WAY
TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:90%
OF THE REAL REALITY,

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.140 align:middle line:84%
THE SO-CALLED REAL REALITY,
THAT WE'RE IN.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:90%
AND IT'S USED EVERY DAY.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:84%
IN FACT, A WHOLE NEW FIELD
HAS DEVELOPED

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.650 align:middle line:84%
BASED UPON THIS IDEA
CALLED QUANTUM COMPUTERS

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:90%
AND QUANTUM COMPUTATION.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:90%
AND IN THE YEARS TO COME,

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.790 align:middle line:84%
WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE AND MORE
OF THIS NEW IDEA EMERGING.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:90%
AND PARALLEL REALITIES

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:84%
OR EVEN GOING INTO THEM
AND TAKING A PHOTOGRAPH

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:84%
AND BRINGING IT
BACK OUT AGAIN --

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.990 align:middle line:90%
THAT MAY NOT BE SCIENCE FICTION.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:05.160 align:middle line:84%
THAT MAY BE SOMETHING
WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SOON.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.600 align:middle line:90%
SO, I THINK RIGHT NOW,

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.500 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME
TO BE THINKING ABOUT

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.240 align:middle line:84%
THE RELATIONSHIP
OF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:90%
TO QUANTUM PHYSICS.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.720 align:middle line:90%
-SO, THERE IS THE ABILITY

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.250 align:middle line:84%
FOR ENERGY TO EXIST
OUTSIDE OF TIME AND SPACE.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.490 align:middle line:84%
THE SPIRITUAL REALM
ESSENTIALLY HAS NO TIME FRAME.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:84%
THE TIME FRAME
EXISTS HERE ON EARTH.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:84%
THE SPIRITUAL REALM EXISTS
OUTSIDE OF A TIME FRAME.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:90%
IT'S VERY HARD TO INTERRELATE

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.600 align:middle line:84%
WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.770 align:middle line:84%
AND WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE EARTHLY REALM.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:84%
SO, THEN PEOPLE ASK ABOUT
A LIFE-BETWEEN-LIVES REGRESSION.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
THEY'LL SAY, "I DESIRE
TO HAVE AN LBL REGRESSION,

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:57.810 align:middle line:84%
BUT WHICH BETWEEN LIFE
AM I GOING TO VISIT?"

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.080 align:middle line:90%
-WELL, ONE ALTERNATIVE IS TO SAY

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:84%
THEY'RE IN ALTERNATIVE REALITIES
OR WORLDS OR UNIVERSES EVEN,

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT THESE ARE THERE,
BUT THEY'RE PARALLEL

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.830 align:middle line:90%
AND INVISIBLE TO US

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.800 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE ONCE WE'VE CHOSEN
TO SEE REALITY ONE WAY,

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.600 align:middle line:84%
IT GETS BLOCKED FROM US
TO SEE THIS OTHER WAY.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.830 align:middle line:84%
IT'S LIKE BLINDERS
THAT GET PUT ON.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.300 align:middle line:90%
WE CAN'T SEE THE OTHER REALITY.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.840 align:middle line:84%
BUT IN THE OTHER REALITY,
THE SAME THING IS GOING ON.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.670 align:middle line:84%
WE CAN'T SEE THE WORLD
THAT WE'RE IN

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.280 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IN THE OTHER REALITY,
WE'RE SEEING THAT WORLD.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:90%
AND SO, THESE PARALLEL REALITIES

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.480 align:middle line:84%
ARE ALSO
ALL OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.280 align:middle line:84%
NOW, THAT IDEA SOUNDS LIKE
ALMOST HOKUM.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.750 align:middle line:84%
AND I CAN'T BLAME ANYBODY
FOR SAYING, "OH, THAT'S CRAZY.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:37.520 align:middle line:84%
HOW CAN YOU HAVE
SO MANY REALITIES?"

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
-WHEN WE TRAVEL
INTO THE SPIRITUAL REALM,

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:48.470 align:middle line:84%
INTO THE BETWEEN LIFE
IN AN LBL REGRESSION,

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:51.740 align:middle line:84%
WE BASICALLY --
ALL OF OUR BETWEEN LIVES

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.910 align:middle line:84%
COLLAPSE INTO ONE ANOTHER,
IF YOU WILL,

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.640 align:middle line:84%
AND WE STEP INTO
WHAT WE OFTEN CALL "NOW TIME".

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.550 align:middle line:84%
SO, WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:06.880 align:middle line:84%
BASED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING
PRESENTLY IN OUR EARTHLY LIFE.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.190 align:middle line:84%
THE SPIRIT WORLD
IS THE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:84%
IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE
MANY BELIEF STRUCTURES

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.530 align:middle line:84%
THAT SAY THE SPIRIT WORLD
IS SEGMENTED --

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.340 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S A POSITIVE PLACE
AND A NOT-SO-POSITIVE PLACE --

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.770 align:middle line:84%
THAT KIND OF INFORMATION
HAS NEVER COME THROUGH

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:84%
IN THOUSANDS OF
LIFE-BETWEEN-LIFE REGRESSIONS.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.110 align:middle line:84%
AND SO, THE SPIRIT WORLD
IS OPEN TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.550 align:middle line:84%
WE ARE NOT BLOCKED
AT A CERTAIN POINT

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.390 align:middle line:90%
AND DISALLOWED ENTRY

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:47.120 align:middle line:84%
DEPENDING ON WHAT WE HAVE
OR HAVEN'T DONE IN OUR LIFE.

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.330 align:middle line:84%
THE SPIRIT WORLD
DOES APPEAR DIFFERENT

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:90%
REGRESSION TO REGRESSION.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.310 align:middle line:84%
FOR SOME SOULS,
PARTICULARLY FOR SOULS

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:06.080 align:middle line:84%
WHO ARE NOT
OF A HIGH LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE,

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.180 align:middle line:84%
THERE IS ALMOST
A MEETING PLACE THAT EXISTS.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.480 align:middle line:84%
REMINDS ME OF A TRAIN
OR A BUS STATION WHERE --

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.390 align:middle line:90%
WHEN THE SOUL HAS LEFT THE BODY.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IT COMES IN TO SPEND TIME
AS IT'S CROSSING OVER.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.910 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S OFTEN SORT OF
A MEETING PLACE

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:39.040 align:middle line:84%
WHERE THE SOUL CAN BE MET
BY LOVED ONES,

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.180 align:middle line:84%
WHERE THE SOUL IS ASSISTED
IN ORIENTING,

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.320 align:middle line:84%
IN ADJUSTING TO BEING
IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.750 align:middle line:84%
IT'S ALMOST SLOWING DOWN
THE PROCESS

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.120 align:middle line:84%
OF MOVING INTO
THE SPIRITUAL REALM.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:84%
-WE HAVE
WHAT WE CALL FOCUS LEVELS.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.590 align:middle line:84%
AND WE REFER TO THEM
AS FOCUS LEVELS,

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:58.360 align:middle line:84%
DIFFERENT STATES
OF CONSCIOUSNESS, AS NUMBERS.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.130 align:middle line:84%
AND WE SIMPLY DO THAT
SO THERE'S NO ATTACHMENT,

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.370 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW,
THROUGH WORDS OR WHATEVER.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.470 align:middle line:90%
IT'S JUST LEVELS.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:06.870 align:middle line:84%
WE FOUND A PLACE
THAT WE CALL FOCUS 27.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.370 align:middle line:84%
AND MY FATHER REFERS TO THIS
AS THE PARK.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:12.140 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS A PLACE HE FOUND
IN HIS EXPLORATIONS

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:84%
WHICH IS VERY MUCH LIKE EARTH
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.550 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE GRASS
AND THE TREES AND EVERYTHING.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:23.350 align:middle line:84%
AND IT FEELS VERY REAL,
BUT HE CALLED IT A PARK.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.360 align:middle line:90%
AND WE'VE FOUND THAT

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.530 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S A HEALING
AND REGENERATION CENTER THERE,

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:36.070 align:middle line:90%
THERE'S A PLANNING CENTER THERE.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:41.040 align:middle line:84%
IT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE PLACE,
IF YOU WILL.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:46.240 align:middle line:84%
-WELL, FOCUS 27 IS A STATE
THAT MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.180 align:middle line:84%
AND RELIGIONS
WOULD REFER TO AS HEAVEN.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.320 align:middle line:90%
IT IS CERTAINLY ONE HEAVEN.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.290 align:middle line:90%
IT'S A STATE OF GREAT JOY.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:02.330 align:middle line:84%
IT'S A STATE THAT OFFERS
AN OPPORTUNITY

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:09.030 align:middle line:84%
FOR AMAZING LEARNINGS
AND INSIGHT INTO --

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:12.970 align:middle line:84%
NOT ONLY INSIGHT INTO,
BUT PARTICIPATION,

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:20.740 align:middle line:84%
IN PLANNING
HOW THINGS MIGHT UNFOLD

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.710 align:middle line:84%
BOTH HERE ON THE EARTH
AND INDIVIDUAL LIVES

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:29.550 align:middle line:84%
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE PHYSICAL
AND NONPHYSICAL WORLD.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:31.120 align:middle line:90%
-WE ALL HAVE SOUL GROUPS

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.460 align:middle line:84%
CONSISTING OF
3 TO 10 OR 12 MEMBERS

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:37.090 align:middle line:84%
THAT ARE TOGETHER BECAUSE
WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.100 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION TO ASK --

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.600 align:middle line:84%
WHAT IS IT
THAT BRINGS YOU ALL TOGETHER?

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.540 align:middle line:84%
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TOGETHER
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD?

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.340 align:middle line:84%
AND USUALLY PEOPLE
ARE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.080 align:middle line:84%
AND IT MAY BE
THAT THEY'RE DOING WORK TOGETHER

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.180 align:middle line:84%
OR THEY MAY BE WORKING ON
SIMILAR LESSONS TOGETHER.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.320 align:middle line:90%
-WENT THROUGH.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:84%
IMMEDIATELY, MY GUIDES
WERE THERE -- IMMEDIATELY.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:90%
I DIDN'T GO INTO ANY CHAMBERS.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.060 align:middle line:90%
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CLEANSING.

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.860 align:middle line:84%
MY GUIDES ARE LIKE, "WHAT'S UP?
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE."

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.560 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS LITERALLY LIKE,
SIT DOWN AND HAVE A POWWOW.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.170 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS WHAT MY WHOLE ENTIRE

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.300 align:middle line:84%
LIFE-BETWEEN-LIFE SESSION
CONSISTED OF.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.300 align:middle line:84%
THE THERAPIST
THAT I WAS WORKING WITH

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.470 align:middle line:84%
HAD A LOT OF INTERACTION
WITH MY GUIDES.

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.770 align:middle line:84%
APPARENTLY THEY WERE
VERY HIGH-VIBRATIONAL,

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.140 align:middle line:90%
ENLIGHTENED TEACHERS.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.010 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY SHARED
A LOT OF INFORMATION WITH HER.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
I KIND OF ACTED AS A CHANNEL
TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION,

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.020 align:middle line:90%
TO HAVE IT COME THROUGH.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:36.020 align:middle line:84%
AND MOST OF THE INFORMATION
THAT WAS COVERED

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.720 align:middle line:84%
WAS SPECIFIC STUFF FOR ME --
NO PREDICTIONS OF ANY SORT,

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:43.290 align:middle line:90%
BUT CONNECTING TO

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.730 align:middle line:84%
WHAT WAS THE INTENTION
THAT I HAD STATED FOR MYSELF,

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.370 align:middle line:84%
WHAT DID I WANT TO EXPERIENCE,
WHAT DID I COME HERE FOR.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:54.840 align:middle line:84%
-AND THE FIRST PERSON
THAT APPEARED TO MY RIGHT

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.610 align:middle line:90%
WAS MY SON SCOTT.

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:59.540 align:middle line:90%
AND SCOTT WAS LIKE MY SOUL MATE.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.780 align:middle line:90%
HE WAS A REAL OLD SOUL.

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.050 align:middle line:84%
HE WAS 27 YEARS OLD
WHEN HE PASSED AWAY,

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.450 align:middle line:90%
BUT HAD LIVED SUCH A FULL LIFE.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.850 align:middle line:90%
AND IT WAS JUST REALLY POWERFUL

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:84%
TO HAVE SUCH A VIVID FEELING
OF BEING THERE WITH HIM.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:18.130 align:middle line:84%
-EVEN THOUGH NOTHING FRIGHTENING
EVER HAPPENS THERE,

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:84%
SOULS ALWAYS FEEL
A SENSE OF INTIMIDATION,

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I GUESS I WOULD SAY,
WHEN THEY'RE CALLED BEFORE

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.800 align:middle line:84%
WHAT WE HAVE TERMED
A COUNCIL OF ELDERS

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.570 align:middle line:90%
OR A COUNCIL OF WISE BEINGS.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.310 align:middle line:84%
AND THEIR GUIDE
USUALLY ACCOMPANIES THEM

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.620 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS
IN A BUILDING OR A SPACE

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.180 align:middle line:90%
THAT SEEMS VERY FORMAL.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:46.120 align:middle line:84%
AND A GROUP OF 5, 6,
OR MAYBE EVEN 10 ELDERS

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.490 align:middle line:90%
COME IN AND THEY ASK QUESTIONS.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:52.460 align:middle line:84%
AND ALWAYS
IN THE MOST LOVING WAY,

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.600 align:middle line:84%
THE PERSON IS GIVEN
SOME SUGGESTIONS

00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:01.170 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT
PROCEED FURTHER IN THE NEXT LIFE

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:04.040 align:middle line:90%
AND HOW THEY CAN DO BETTER.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.380 align:middle line:90%
AND IT'S A VERY SERIOUS MEETING,

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.210 align:middle line:84%
BUT IT'S NOT PUNITIVE
OR JUDGMENTAL

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:12.520 align:middle line:90%
IN THE WAY THAT WE MIGHT THINK.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.850 align:middle line:84%
-THE COORDINATING BODY
OF THE SPIRITUAL REALM

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:22.530 align:middle line:90%
IS COMPRISED OF SOULS

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:26.500 align:middle line:84%
THAT HAVE FINISHED
THEIR INCARNATION ON EARTH.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.100 align:middle line:84%
THEY'VE PROGRESSED
TO A PARTICULAR LEVEL.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.700 align:middle line:90%
THEY THEN WORK AT, YOU KNOW,

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.540 align:middle line:84%
WE USE THESE WORDS
HIGHER, LOWER --

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.470 align:middle line:84%
IT'S HARD
NOT TO USE THOSE WORDS.

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.640 align:middle line:84%
THEY WORK AT A HIGHER LEVEL
OF WISDOM,

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.680 align:middle line:84%
BUT THEY ARE
ULTIMATELY COORDINATED

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.180 align:middle line:90%
BY A HIGHEST LEVEL OF WISDOM

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.520 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE ALL CHOOSE TO LABEL
IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:90%
BUT AS WE PROGRESS AS A SOUL,

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.890 align:middle line:84%
WE FINE-TUNE OUR INTEREST AREA,
WE FINE-TUNE OUR ABILITIES.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN WE CAN, IN FACT,
PROGRESS TO THE POINT

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:04.430 align:middle line:84%
WHERE WE DON'T SPEND
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:06.600 align:middle line:84%
WITH OUR CLUSTER GROUP
ANY LONGER.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.840 align:middle line:84%
AND WE THEN CAN SPEND
PRIMARILY TIME

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.410 align:middle line:84%
WITH A GROUP
THAT IS MUCH MORE SPECIALIZED.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:15.850 align:middle line:84%
-JUST BEFORE I LEFT, I FELT --
LEFT THE SOUL GROUP --

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I FELT LIKE SOMEBODY HAD
PLACED A HAND ON MY FOREHEAD.

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.520 align:middle line:84%
AND I, YOU KNOW,
AGAIN FELT THIS AMAZING ENERGY.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.190 align:middle line:84%
AND I SAID, "OH, I THINK
THEY'RE JUST KNOCKING IN

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.390 align:middle line:84%
"A LITTLE EXTRA KNOWLEDGE
INTO MY HEAD

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:30.690 align:middle line:90%
"AND I'M BEING HEALED

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:35.200 align:middle line:84%
"OF ANYTHING
THAT I NEEDED TO BE HEALED OF

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.600 align:middle line:84%
"AS FAR AS
SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:43.340 align:middle line:84%
THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED
IN MY CURRENT INCARNATION."

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.320 align:middle line:90%
-DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.930 align:middle line:84%
DO I HAVE A PARTICULAR SPIRITUAL
OR RELIGIOUS ORIENTATION?

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:06.500 align:middle line:84%
AND WHAT I TELL PEOPLE IS THAT
IT'S ALL ONE AND THE SAME,

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.100 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
OF SPIRIT OR WISDOM

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:90%
OR LOVE OR ADVANCEMENT

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:17.070 align:middle line:84%
IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL
THAT WE CAN CALL THE UNIVERSE,

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.410 align:middle line:84%
THE DAO, WE CAN CALL IT GOD,
GREAT SPIRIT.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.610 align:middle line:84%
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TERMS
FOR THIS.

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:27.280 align:middle line:84%
-WE OBVIOUSLY STAY VERY NEUTRAL
WITH ALL OF THIS

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.350 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU COME HERE

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:34.160 align:middle line:84%
IS YOU ARE EXPLORING
A LOT OF YOUR BELIEF SYSTEMS.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.390 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT.

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:39.600 align:middle line:84%
AND IF YOU FIND OUT
THROUGH EXPERIENCE

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.130 align:middle line:84%
THAT YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM
CAN BECOME A KNOWN,

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:44.630 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.140 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.340 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:53.810 align:middle line:84%
-AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I LOOKED UP

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.010 align:middle line:84%
AND LITERALLY SAW
THIS BOMB DROP.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:59.050 align:middle line:84%
AND IT LOOKED EXACTLY THE WAY
YOU SEE IT DEPICTED

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.190 align:middle line:84%
IN HISTORY BOOKS AND IN PICTURES
AND ON TELEVISION.

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:04.950 align:middle line:84%
AND IT LITERALLY CAME DOWN LIKE
A GIANT MUSHROOM CLOUD

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:07.490 align:middle line:84%
AND THIS SMOKE JUST STARTED
BARRELING TOWARDS US.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.590 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK
WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE TRAUMA,

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:11.190 align:middle line:90%
YOU EXPERIENCE IT IN SLOW MOTION

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:12.400 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.100 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS TAKING A VERY LONG
PERIOD OF TIME TO UNFOLD,

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.530 align:middle line:90%
WHEN IN ESSENCE I THINK IT WAS

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:18.370 align:middle line:84%
PROBABLY THREE SECONDS,
YOU KNOW?

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.740 align:middle line:84%
BUT THEN EVERYTHING AROUND ME
WAS BURNING, WAS IN FLAMES.

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.310 align:middle line:90%
AND I REMEMBER GRABBING --

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I HAD A SMALL CHILD,
AND I GRABBED THIS SMALL CHILD.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.180 align:middle line:90%
AND THERE WAS FIRE EVERYWHERE.

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.580 align:middle line:84%
AND THE ONLY WAY TO NOT BURN,
TO BE AFFLICTED BY THE FIRE,

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.220 align:middle line:90%
WAS TO GET INTO THIS WATER.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:37.220 align:middle line:84%
-IT WAS AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE,
17.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:41.090 align:middle line:90%
HE GAVE ME EVERYTHING,

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:44.790 align:middle line:84%
LOVED ME, TOUTED ME,
PRESENTS GALORE,

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:47.460 align:middle line:90%
AND I JUST DID NOT LIKE HIM.

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:90%
AND I TURNED MY BACK ON HIM,

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:56.540 align:middle line:84%
ULTIMATELY
CAUSING HIM TO LATER KILL ME.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.090 align:middle line:84%
-IF YOU BELIEVE
IN LIFE AFTER DEATH,

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:17.960 align:middle line:84%
YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU COME BACK
OR YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION,

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.630 align:middle line:84%
WELL,
THEN YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:20.100 align:middle line:90%
HOW YOU'RE LEAVING THIS PLANET

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:24.170 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA BE REINCARNATED

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:28.100 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU MAY COME BACK TO,

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.610 align:middle line:90%
WHAT YOU CREATE.

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.780 align:middle line:84%
-YEAH, I THINK IN CHINA
THE IDEA WAS

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:36.110 align:middle line:84%
THAT WHEN THE CHINESE
THINK ABOUT TIME

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:40.020 align:middle line:84%
OR THINK ABOUT WHO THEY ARE
AND WHAT THEY ARE,

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:42.320 align:middle line:84%
THEY KEEP THEIR ANCESTORS
IN MIND.

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.820 align:middle line:90%
WHEREAS IN OUR CULTURE,

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.090 align:middle line:84%
IT'S THE LAST THING
WE THINK ABOUT

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:47.920 align:middle line:90%
IS WHO AND WHAT WE CAME FROM.

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.790 align:middle line:84%
MOST OF US DON'T EVEN CARE
THAT OUR ANCESTORS

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:53.360 align:middle line:84%
CAME FROM THIS COUNTRY
OR THAT COUNTRY.

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.500 align:middle line:90%
WE'RE AMERICANS.

00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.370 align:middle line:90%
ANCESTORS ARE DEAD AND BURIED.

00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:57.370 align:middle line:90%
WE DON'T CARE.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:59.970 align:middle line:90%
[ WIND WHISTLING ]

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:14.780 align:middle line:84%
-REGRESSION THERAPY
IS UTILIZING TRANCE

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.050 align:middle line:84%
OR UTILIZING HYPNOSIS
TO GUIDE A CLIENT

00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:21.620 align:middle line:84%
TO GO BACKWARD IN TIME
TO SORT OF GO THROUGH

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:24.530 align:middle line:84%
WHAT WE MIGHT CALL
AGE REGRESSION.

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:28.100 align:middle line:84%
SO, TYPICALLY, FOR A LONG,
LONG TIME, CENTURIES PROBABLY,

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:32.240 align:middle line:84%
PSYCHIATRISTS
HAVE GUIDED THEIR CLIENTS

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.070 align:middle line:84%
INTO AGE REGRESSION
IN THIS LIFE,

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.040 align:middle line:90%
LOOKING FOR LOST MEMORY,

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.480 align:middle line:84%
LOOKING FOR
TRAUMA-ORIENTED PERIODS OF TIME

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.550 align:middle line:90%
TO TRY TO DO HEALING WORK.

00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:44.380 align:middle line:90%
SO IT ALL IS PREDICATED

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:49.250 align:middle line:84%
ON THE BELIEF
THAT OUR SOUL HAS CONTINUITY.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:52.290 align:middle line:84%
SO, WE'RE GOING BACK
TO MYSTICAL BELIEF STRUCTURE,

00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:54.520 align:middle line:84%
TO A BELIEF STRUCTURE
THAT EXISTED

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.960 align:middle line:84%
PRIOR TO APPROXIMATELY
2,000 YEARS AGO

00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.330 align:middle line:90%
IN MOST CULTURES OF THE EARTH

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:04.230 align:middle line:84%
WHERE THE BELIEF IS
THAT OUR SOUL HAS CONTINUITY.

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:07.140 align:middle line:84%
SO WE LIVE
AND WE WILL LIVE AGAIN.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.440 align:middle line:84%
IT'S THE WHOLE CONCEPT
OF REINCARNATION.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.580 align:middle line:90%
-I WAS IN EUROPE IN THE 1600s.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I WAS IN MY 20s.
MY NAME WAS SARAH.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I WAS LIVING A RATHER
LONELY LIFE IN THE VILLAGE

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.890 align:middle line:84%
AND JUST DOING CRAFT WORK,
NEEDLE WORK,

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:30.130 align:middle line:90%
AND WASN'T MARRIED AT THE TIME.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.200 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WAS MY BEGINNINGS.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
BASICALLY LOOKING DOWN,
SEEING WHAT I WAS WEARING

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
AND THE DESCRIPTION
AND THE PICTURE JUST UNFOLDED.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
-I REMEMBER A WOMAN WHO WAS
A LITTLE BOY IN A PAST LIFE

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS DURING WARTIME
IN GERMANY, I THINK.

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
AND SHE WAS COWERING
UNDER A TRUCK.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
AND SHE COULD SEE THE PUDDLES
OF RAINWATER

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.420 align:middle line:84%
AND THE BOOTS OF THE SOLDIERS,
AND SHE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
AND ALL OF THE EMOTIONS
CAME THROUGH.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
SHE COULD REALLY FEEL
AND RE-EXPERIENCE

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.220 align:middle line:84%
WHAT IT FELT LIKE
TO BE THAT LITTLE BOY

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.520 align:middle line:90%
AND BEING VERY AFRAID.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT
AND WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.530 align:middle line:84%
FOR A CLIENT
TO EXPERIENCE THEMSELVES

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.330 align:middle line:84%
FROM A LARGER PERSPECTIVE
THAN JUST ONE LIFETIME.

01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
IT ALLOWS THEM TO EXPERIENCE
DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW,

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
TO FEEL WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A DIFFERENT GENDER

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.570 align:middle line:90%
OR A DIFFERENT WALK OF LIFE,

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
TO EXPERIENCE
THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
THAT WERE IMPORTANT
IN DIFFERENT ERAS,

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
AND IT REALLY GIVES THEM
A WIDER SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT WHO THEY ARE
AND ALSO ALLOWS US

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
TO UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE
MORE EASILY

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.250 align:middle line:90%
AND WITH LESS JUDGMENT.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
-THE SECOND LIFE
THAT WE WERE IN, WE WERE MONKS.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.530 align:middle line:84%
AND WE LIVED
IN THE SAME MONASTERY.

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:45.700 align:middle line:90%
AND HE WAS MORE LIKE MY TEACHER.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
HE OPENED UP DIFFERENT AREAS OF
RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE, BELIEFS.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:58.150 align:middle line:90%
HE INTRODUCED ME TO NEW THINGS

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:03.990 align:middle line:90%
FROM A VERY THEOLOGICAL PLACE.

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:07.220 align:middle line:84%
THE ONLY WAY
I CAN DESCRIBE IT IS,

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS AS PURE LOVE
AS I THINK YOU COULD FEEL.

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS A REALLY COMFORTABLE AND
REALLY LOVING AND REALLY PURE.

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
AND OUR PATHS
WERE JUST ANCHORED.

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
OUR PATHS WERE VERY DEEP
IN OUR CONVICTION TO GOD

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
AND IN OUR CONVICTION
TO SERVICE.

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
-WE GOT INTO THIS WATER
AND I COULDN'T SWIM,

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.290 align:middle line:90%
AND MY CHILD COULDN'T SWIM.

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
[ Voice breaking ]
AND BASICALLY WE DROWNED.

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
AND LIKE,
I...I KEPT REENACTING THAT,

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
THE DROWNING
AND LOSING MY CHILD.

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:49.870 align:middle line:90%
AND I'D WAKE UP, LIKE, GASPING.

01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
SO WENT I WENT INTO THIS STATE
OF HYPNOSIS AND I RE-LIVED IT,

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.570 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL
AND VERY TRAUMATIC

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE IT WAS EVEN REALER
IN THE STATE OF HYPNOSIS

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
THAN IN THE DREAM STATE
'CAUSE I WAS ALERT, YOU KNOW?

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:04.150 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS NOW PRESENT-DAY TIME.

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
-SO MANY PEOPLE
KIND OF GET INTO THAT MIND-SET

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
OF LIKE, "WELL, WHO WAS I
IN A PAST LIFE?"

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
AND FOR ME,
THAT QUESTION NEVER REALLY --

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
THAT QUESTION
NEVER REALLY RANG TRUE

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
AS SOMETHING THAT WAS RELEVANT
TO WHO I WAS

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
OR HOW I WAS EXPERIENCING
LIFE TODAY.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
WHAT RANG TRUE TO ME AND
WHAT'S GOTTEN AT IN THE BOOK

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
AND THE WHOLE SORT OF
LIFE-IN-BETWEEN-LIVES THING,

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
WAS A CLEAR SENSE OF WHO YOU ARE

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
AS A SOUL INDEPENDENT
OF YOUR CURRENT INCARNATION,

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
YOUR CURRENT MANIFESTATION
AS A BODY.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.120 align:middle line:90%
-THE SECOND ONE WOULD BE ITALY.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%
I WAS IN AN ITALIAN VILLAGE.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I WAS MARRIED,
HAD A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS.

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
AND SO OUR MARRIAGE
WAS VERY TUMULTUOUS.

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WAS A BUTCHER.
I WAS A HOMEMAKER.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS VERY ROUGH TIMES
DURING THAT TIME.

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS I THINK IN THE 1700s,
IF I RECALL.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:08.440 align:middle line:90%
AND SO, LESSONS, AGAIN, LEARNED.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.950 align:middle line:90%
I RELATED THAT PERSON

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
TO POSSIBLY BEING THE PERSON
THAT I WAS FIRST MARRIED TO,

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
THAT I WAS MARRIED TO
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:18.720 align:middle line:90%
AND I HAD LEFT THAT MARRIAGE.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS
A VERY THERAPEUTIC TIME FOR ME

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE IT REALLY OPENED ME UP
TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF GROWING

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.600 align:middle line:90%
INSTEAD OF STAGNATING.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
-THE MOST VIVID ONE
EXPERIENTIALLY

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:30.200 align:middle line:90%
WAS A WHALE INCARNATION.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
THE MOST SORT OF VIVID, LIKE,
SNAPSHOTS FROM THAT EXPERIENCE

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:42.580 align:middle line:84%
WERE SURFACING
AND SEEING HUMANS ON THE BOATS

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
THAT WERE WHALE HUNTERS,
WHALE FISHERMEN,

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:46.920 align:middle line:90%
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
AND JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT THEM
AS THEY WERE, YOU KNOW,

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
KILLING OTHER WHALES
OR TRYING TO KILL ME

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
OR TRYING TO
KILL OTHER WHALES IN A POD

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
AND HAVING THIS VERY SORT OF
CALM SENSATION

01:04:58.790 --> 01:04:59.930 align:middle line:90%
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
LIKE,
ALMOST A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED,

01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:06.500 align:middle line:84%
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED
ABOUT WHY THEY WERE SO PANICKED,

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.540 align:middle line:90%
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
WHERE WERE THOSE FEELINGS
COMING FROM,

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
WHERE WAS THE AGGRESSION,
WHERE DOES --

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:12.410 align:middle line:90%
YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:14.279 align:middle line:84%
A "THIS DOESN'T REALLY
QUITE MAKE SENSE."

01:05:14.279 --> 01:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
EVEN KNOWING THAT I WAS,

01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:20.520 align:middle line:90%
YOU KNOW, "IN DANGER,"

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
BUT NOT NECESSARILY ANY SENSE
OF FEAR WHATSOEVER.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
-MINE WAS I WAS A TRAPEZE ARTIST
IN THE CIRCUS.

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:33.330 align:middle line:90%
AND THIS MAN WAS ALSO THERE.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:35.700 align:middle line:90%
HE WAS A LION TAMER.

OUTSIDE OF OUR AWARENESS.

NOT DOING WELL IN THEIR LIFE.

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:53.790 align:middle line:84%
IN EXPLORING PARAPSYCHOLOGY
AND PSYCHIC INFORMATION,

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
AND REALIZED THAT
WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING REAL.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:01.030 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS REAL EVEN THOUGH
WE COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT.

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
BUT IT'S TAKEN 35 YEARS TO FIND
AN ACCEPTABLE EXPLANATION

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:07.500 align:middle line:90%
IN QUANTUM PHENOMENA.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
-WELL, YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S
UNKNOWN BECAUSE YOU DON'T ASK.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
ONCE THAT YOU ASK,
THEN YOU KNOW.

01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:19.510 align:middle line:90%
AND THE UNKNOWN BECOMES KNOWN.

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
THEN WHAT WE HAVE IN THE MIND
CAN BE KNOWN IF WE ASK,

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.120 align:middle line:90%
IF WE LEARN TO LISTEN.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.190 align:middle line:90%
THEN THE UNKNOWN BECOMES KNOWN.

01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
WHAT IS UNKNOWABLE,
YOU NEVER WILL KNOW

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:38.330 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE,
WITH THE SYMBOLS THAT WE HAVE.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.670 align:middle line:84%
-EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
TO ME THESE DAYS,

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I TRUST THE UNIVERSE
MORE AND MORE.

01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
AND THE WORLD DOESN'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN ITSELF TO ME.

01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN IT LOOKS REALLY BAD
FROM THE OUTSIDE,

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I HAVE MORE FAITH

01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
THAT A PERSON'S LIFE
IS UNFOLDING

01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:26.210 align:middle line:90%
IN JUST THE WAY THAT IT NEEDS TO

01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
FOR THEIR SOUL'S GROWTH
AND LEARNING.

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT THOUGHT GIVES ME
A LOT OF COMFORT.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
-MANY OF US SPEND
SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:40.059 align:middle line:84%
WORRYING ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW

01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
OR JUST WALLOWING IN THINGS
THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:47.540 align:middle line:90%
INSTEAD OF BEING IN THE NOW.

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:53.809 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK THEY CAN LEARN A LOT
FROM JUST BEING IN THE MOMENT

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:59.080 align:middle line:84%
AND EXPERIENCING LIFE
AND HAVING JOY IN THEIR LIFE.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
-AS YOU EXPAND IN AWARENESS,

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
WHAT YOU DISCOVER IS,
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CREATION,

01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:08.559 align:middle line:84%
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS
WE REALLY CAN DO

01:17:08.559 --> 01:17:12.590 align:middle line:90%
IS CREATE HEAVEN ON EARTH NOW.

01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
-I WOULD SAY
THAT WE ARE EVOLVING

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
INTO AN INTELLIGENT SPECIES
THAT HAS A TRUE UNDERSTANDING

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.890 align:middle line:84%
OF HOW INTERCONNECTED
EVERYTHING IS

01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:41.590 align:middle line:84%
AND HOW CONNECTED WE ARE
TO EVERYTHING --

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
TO THE EARTH...

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:48.600 align:middle line:90%
AND TO SPIRIT.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
-AND SO, I THINK
THAT LEADS TO LOOKING AT,

01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:59.410 align:middle line:90%
WHAT IS THE POINT?

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:01.510 align:middle line:90%
WHY DO WE COME INTO BODY?

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, WHY AM I OR ANY ONE
ELSE INCARNATE AT THIS TIME?

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK
THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM LINE

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
IS WE ARE HERE IN BODY FOR
THE PURPOSE OF PROGRESSION --

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:16.160 align:middle line:90%
BOTH OUR OWN PROGRESSION

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.090 align:middle line:84%
AND THE PROGRESSION
OF OTHER SOULS

01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:21.930 align:middle line:90%
AND HOW WE IMPACT OTHER SOULS.

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
-AND, YES, THEY CAN DO BETTER,
BUT IN ORDER TO DO BETTER,

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
THEY NEED
TO HAVE MORE AWARENESS,

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.340 align:middle line:90%
TO BE MORE AWARE.

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.140 align:middle line:90%
IF THEY HAVE MORE AWARENESS,

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
THE BEST WILL BE BETTER
AND BETTER AND BETTER.

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:39.710 align:middle line:90%
-THERE'S NO ULTIMATE DESTINY

01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE
HAS BEEN CREATED IN SUCH A WAY

01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE CAN CREATE
NEW DESTINIES.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:48.960 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK OUR ULTIMATE DESTINY
WOULD BE TO RECOGNIZE

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF OUR DESTINY.

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
-IN MY OPINION,
ONLY BY USING THE BEST

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
OF OUR RATIONAL
AND OUR INTUITIVE FACULTIES

01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:04.809 align:middle line:84%
AND THE BEST OF OUR SCIENTIFIC
TECHNOLOGIES AND PROTOCOLS

01:19:04.809 --> 01:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
WILL WE EVER BE ABLE
TO TEASE OUT OF NATURE

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
THESE SECRETS
THAT ARE VERY ELUSIVE RIGHT NOW.
