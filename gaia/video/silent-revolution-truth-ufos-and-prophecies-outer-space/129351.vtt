00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
How did you get involved
with this case?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.053 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
In 1979 I walked into a
bookstore and I saw

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.347 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Lee and Brit Elders' photo book
on the Meier case.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:01:00.143 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In 1986 a guy I met in a little
cafe gave me almost 2000 pages

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:03.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of transcripts of Meier's
conversations with the Plejaren.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.565 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So Mike, where are we going
right now?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.526 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
We're going over to
do a radio show

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:12.656 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
with Michael Parker at
a radio show called Karma Air

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:16.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that broadcasts out of
Hollywood, somewhere here on

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:19.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Sunset Boulevard,
to discuss the Billy Meier case.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Mr. Horn, how are you?
Come on in.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I'm looking forward to this show
because, um... I've been into

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the UFO thing for a long time.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Truth seekers, how's it going?
This is Michael Parker, and this

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is another episode of Dark
Matter here on Karma Air.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.513 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Billy Meier case is not one
that I have fully investigated,

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.224 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
so I'm going to be learning
today, just as you guys.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:42.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Plenty of adamant believers,
and plenty of staunch critics.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:47.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So it's a amazing story,
and let's just cut

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.693 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
straight to the chase, and
Michael, welcome to the show.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:51.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Thanks, Michael,
glad to be here.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Billy Meier is
a soon-to-be 70-year-old man

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
living in Switzerland.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:59.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Meier has one arm,
he lost his arm in about 1965.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He started to take
photographs of UFOs in 1964.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He claims that his first
contacts with extraterrestrials

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
took place when he was
only a 5-year-old boy,

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:15.594 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that there is more photographic
evidence and video evidence

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:19.306 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
for this particular case than
any other existing case.

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:24.269 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And it's almost so good that
you're just, like, Holy Cow!

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
When he took a lot of this
material, took these photos,

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:30.233 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
there was no Photoshop,
there were no home computers.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
If these had been hoaxes,

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.613 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
his designs for these craft
are quite interesting.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.324 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
These official contacts
with extraterrestrials

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:40.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
taking hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of photographs and

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.538 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
films and everything else
that followed, the skeptics

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:48.627 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
would like us to believe that
this man, with no resources,

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:51.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
working as a night watchman and
on a partial disability pension,

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
with one hand,

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:57.427 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is not only a master model
maker, filmmaker, photographer,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.639 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
digital and special effects
person, videographer,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.433 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
metallurgist, electronics
genius, sound recording

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.978 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
engineer, knowledgeable about
topography and mapmaking,

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
geography, ancient history,
mining, ores, agriculture,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.986 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and 30 other disciplines
that he's brought to bear

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.489 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in terms of
the information on this case.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.118 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They will credit him with that,
but they won't say, hey,

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the guy's telling the truth,
he's the one that's

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
meeting with these people.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:28.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In 1958 Meier sent
to the 25 European countries

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:35.006 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
about 115-120
specific predictions.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The United States of America
will be engaged in

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
two wars with Iraq.
The second war will be

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:45.142 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
conducted under a president who
is a son of a former president.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:49.396 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The second war will lead to
an unbelievable disaster.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The end game is this,
and this has been said

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.234 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
even before we launched
the war in Iraq, pertaining

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to US military policies.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Unless the United States
withdraws from all military

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.159 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
bases and from all wars,
and stops sticking its nose

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in everybody else's business
around the world,

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.498 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
there will be a Third World War
which will eliminate

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.668 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
three-quarters of
the population of the planet.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.546 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It will devastate
the North American continent.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We will be
among the hardest hit.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.593 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
All of our major cities
will be destroyed.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.012 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
We are in for a bad time.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.639 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I said, Billy, I remember
reading in the prophesies

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.434 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that Russia has said
there's a high likelihood

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.437 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Russia will invade Iran
as well as Turkey, and then

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
go into Scandinavia,
and this and that.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is all stuff allegedly
published thousands of years ago

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
before we
even knew about a Russia.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I said,
but now America and Israel are

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.491 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
talking about attacking Iran.

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.368 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And he said,
well, I'll tell you this.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:49.372 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If your country attacks Iran,
there is an enormous likelihood

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that Russia and China, which are
becoming closer all the time,

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
will attack your country.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.547 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And that's actually
been spoken about

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.425 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
as a possibility for a while.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.636 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's already in prophecies
that they published years ago

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:05.055 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that I've even put
in one of my newsletters.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Of course that's bothered
a lot of people, but they should

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.726 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
also be bothered that
Meier has spoken very harshly

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:13.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about radical Islam, Russia,
China, you know, a laundry list.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:16.107 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
He was also told,
in January of 2005,

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that AIDS has mutated
and taken some new forms

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:24.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that are fast-acting
and produce, from the HIV,

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.619 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
full-blown AIDS
within a matter of weeks.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now, they've also said that
there would be a cure for AIDS

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.582 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
coming, but it would be
a vaccine that would

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.585 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
either occur
or be in development by 2006.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I haven't heard
an update on what that is,

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but with the new... this problem
with the new strains of AIDS,

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:44.177 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they just said very clearly
that this is something that

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.305 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
your scientists don't know as
much as they think they know

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.765 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
about most matters.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The case is so full
of prophetic, predictive

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.771 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
information that
wherever you can actually

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
check and see - did it happen?
Is this what's happening?

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
OK, it happened.
Now, are the details the same?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.237 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Yeah, the details are the same.
Well, who published it first?

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In every case but one,
that I know of,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.117 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Meier published it first.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
[children speaking German]

[Meier speaking German]

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;We are here on earth 
to lead ourlives because 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.783 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
our consciousness 
must be developed, 

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so that it gathers knowledge, 
gathers wisdom, 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
builds up love, peace,
freedom and harmony.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:59.085 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The human exists in the material
life on earth in order to learn,

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.338 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
just as other humankinds do
on other worlds

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.506 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in the entire universe.

&gt;&gt;My name is Eduard Albert
Meier, but all around the world

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.736 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I am simply called Billy.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:27.614 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I received the name in Tehran
when I was on the road,

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and since then this name
has remained with me.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.703 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;I'd say, in and of itself,
my childhood was very good

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.084 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and very pleasant for me.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:42.504 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I learned very much, on the one
hand, because of my parents,

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:45.006 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and on the other hand
because of an extraterrestrial

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:48.385 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
called Sfath,
whom I got to know in 1942.

[Meier speaking German]

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:56.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;How old were you then?
&gt;&gt;I was 5 years old.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And this man Sfath
taught me very much of

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
my school knowledge, besides
many other things, just as

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Pastor Emanuel Zimmermann did.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Then I confided in the pastor,
and he told me that

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I did not need to be afraid.
He explained to me

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
what telepathy is.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.244 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Whenever I ran off, Sfath
helped me to hide somewhere,

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.587 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and he took me in his spaceship
and he flew somewhere with me

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:27.132 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
where we could talk and
where I could learn from him.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Neurolinguistic programming,
"neuro" standing for

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
how you take the world in
through your five senses,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.566 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
"linguistic" is how that is
communicated internally to you,

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and then "programming"

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
is how do we change

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.112 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
those internal communications

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so that we can
take the world in differently?

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
NLP was started in 1975,

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:57.203 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
basically, modeling
some therapists.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And now, today,
it's really used

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:03.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
much more as far as
in the business community.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.712 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So the skills of
Neurolinguistic Programming

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are pretty much pervasive
in healthcare and education

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.593 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
in a lot of different places.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
What I am noticing
is here is that he is looking

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
down to his right a lot.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And when people look
down to their right,

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:22.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
very often they're accessing
emotions, they're accessing

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:27.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
aspects of what's going on
from an emotional sense.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He's also looking
down a little bit to his left,

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
which would be
his analytical mind.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.575 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So, but most of this is looking
down to his emotional self.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:39.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It looks like he's talking
pretty slow, at a nice pace.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:44.375 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So that would be congruent with
his speaking from his heart.

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:47.295 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
His eyes, however,
are blinking quite a bit.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.173 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And, that could be
an indication, from

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:54.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a body language point of view,
that he's actually

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.472 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
not being congruent, that
there's some nervousness there.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:01.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
However, if he is intelligent,
that also

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
may account for that
and counter it.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.523 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
While the attacks on me and
other people have been really

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:09.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
relatively tame compared to
what's been directed at Meier,

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they've really only
encouraged me to keep on going

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.614 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and get to the bottom
of this story.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.742 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So, Michael,
where are we right now?

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.578 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We just arrived at
the Aquarius Hotel and Casino

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:23.206 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
in lovely Laughlin, Nevada.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.708 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We're at the home of the
International UFO Congress,

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.378 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
where we're going
to do our little presentation

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:31.214 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
on Friday to present
some of the new information

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
on the Billy Meier case.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.552 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There's always new translations
that are being made available

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:39.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on materials, some of which
date back fifty years or more.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:43.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Meier had an interesting
childhood, to say the least.

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:46.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Some of it he considered
to be very, very positive,

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.314 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but some of it was
enormously difficult for him.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:52.735 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He had, since his earlier
contact experiences with this

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:58.157 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
man, Sfath, it developed in him
a duality, if you will.

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:00.451 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The private inner life,
the private life of

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
his communications, and then
being very alienated from

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:06.541 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
other children and other people
because he couldn't express,

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.751 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
he couldn't tell them
anything about this.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He had support from a parish
priest, Father Zimmermann.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.758 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Father Zimmermann,
who became a confidant.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:19.053 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He had actually been contacted,
apparently telepathically,

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:25.226 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
by the Plejaren, to prepare him
to be a source of help for

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:28.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
young Meier, who, they told him,
would come to him.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.441 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There was one situation
where a woman had been abusive,

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:34.611 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
beating him.
At some point she hits him,

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.779 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
slaps him, I think,
with a wet towel that

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:41.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
he then takes away from her,
and slaps her with this towel.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This gets him incarcerated,
for a period of time,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
in a youth prison.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:48.124 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Then, after he's out of
that situation,

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
he seems to attract repeated
accusations of wrongdoing,

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
things that he didn't do.
But he doesn't defend himself,

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:58.092 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
he doesn't put up any kind of a
fight about it. Ends up

00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:01.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
again being incarcerated.
He escapes from this facility,

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:05.558 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and in the process, I think,
he breaks a bone in his foot,

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.061 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
injures himself.
He goes and joins

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The French Foreign Legion.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're talking about somebody
who's 15 or 16 years of age.

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:14.025 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;I joined
The French Foreign Legion

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:18.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because I simply wanted
to leave everything behind me,

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:21.157 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the false accusations
and so forth.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:24.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I wanted to elude the court, and
then when I was in the Legion,

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.789 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I came to the conclusion that
that was not the correct way.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:30.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He found himself with people
who loved to kill, and

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
who were trained to become
better and better killers.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It was not something
that was his calling.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And he escaped. He did something
quite unusual. He walked

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:43.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
out across the desert, left the
French Foreign Legion behind him

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.098 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;That's why I returned to
Switzerland and I gave myself up

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to the authorities who
locked me up in an institution

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
for more than two years.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;He learns
a variety of different skills.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.322 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He is befriended
by one or more people there

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
who want to assist him
and help him

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in his development, his life.
He's a young person still.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And many of these skills
that he would learn in prison,

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:12.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
he would employ and use
later in life in various ways.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.335 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;In each case
I financed the travels

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
by working under way,
as is customary and right,

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:22.385 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to honestly
make my way through life.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.721 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;Now and then, Sfath also
took me to various

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:30.184 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
government people whom I met,
and with whom I could speak.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:34.022 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And indeed, through a speech
translator, a small translation

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:37.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
device which had been fastened
on my belt or breast pocket,

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:40.319 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and so each time,
I could have a conversation

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:43.239 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
with a concerned person
without problems.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.616 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.251 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Sfath had previously been
with each of these people

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.754 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
who he had introduced to me.
He had had conversations with

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:01.632 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
them and he was known by them
as an extraterrestrial.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.095 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There were various persons,
for example,

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.432 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Gandhi in India,
Farouk down in Egypt, and

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:13.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in Abyssinia in today's Ethipoia
I met Selassie.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So are you ready for the speech,
the presentation?

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:22.445 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Pretty much. It's not something
I rehearse, exactly.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I just lay out
my bullet points and

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.116 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
things will be on the screen,
then tell the stories like,

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:30.745 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
can he have covered 142,000
miles on foot hitchhiking?

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:34.749 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Worked something like
360 different jobs,

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:38.795 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
from dog catcher
to snake handler,

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
private detective?
For a while, he was known as

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
The Phantom.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:44.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
The Phantom?

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:47.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Yeah.
He was employed by some Middle

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Eastern police departments

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to bring in serial killers
and mass murderers.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.601 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He had his
Swiss leather jacket on

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
with the Swiss cross,
and Arab headdress.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.064 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Well, maybe he could find
Osama.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.066 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Yeah, nobody else seems to be
able to do it.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's funny you say that
because Meier actually met

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Saddam Hussein when he was
an up and coming thug.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:09.075 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;I met Saddam Hussein
during one of my travels

00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:14.539 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
down in Baghdad.
At that time he was

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:18.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
about the same age as I was,
about 22 years old, I think.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:22.505 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I don't know any more precisely
because it was a long time ago.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He was already someone
who had turned to crime,

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and who said that if he could
one day somehow take control,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
he would do everything
to be recognized by the people,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.599 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
even if he had to
play the role of a holy person.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:36.602 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;When Sfath died
in the early 50's,

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I was contacted
by a female voice.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
A short time later a
young woman named Asket appeared

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:55.246 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who then took up contact
with me, and these contacts

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
lasted for another 11 years.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:02.503 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;What we're told,
in this case, is that

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Billy Meier has been
the contact person

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:07.425 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
chosen by these
extraterrestrial human beings

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for a very specific purpose,
and that is

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to bring to our world,
once again,

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:16.184 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
what they call
the true teachings of creation.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.187 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The Plejaren are said to be
extraterrestrial human beings

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:22.231 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
who live in a star system
that is in the direction of the

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:26.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Pleiades star system that
we can see in our night sky.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.654 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The common portrayal
of extraterrestrials as

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.991 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
little green men or
little grey people is part of

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a disinformation campaign.
We are told that there are

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
so many extraterrestrial
human races in the universe

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.417 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that we would be surprised.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Often when
people feel vulnerable

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.505 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
or small
or powerless,

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:50.343 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and there are times
in all of our lives that we do,

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.596 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
it's very comforting
to believe in something

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:57.725 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
bigger and better than you.
A power, for example,

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
an extraterrestrial
that knows more than you do,

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that can predict the future,
that can take away

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:06.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
the uncertainty.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:11.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
There are a lot of schizotypal
people who do believe in UFOs,

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:16.577 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and do believe that we've been
contacted by extraterrestrials.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:20.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
There is also something called
a delusional disorder,

00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:23.125 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
which is considered
a psychotic disorder,

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:27.463 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but it's very interesting.
People who have this disorder

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:33.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
appear very normal, except for
a very compartmentalized

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:37.723 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
delusion that they have,
like, that they have a

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
relationship with
extraterrestrials.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:44.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Other than that,
they function pretty well.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:47.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Do you see yourself as a
missionary of Billy Meier?

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:50.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I hope not in the sense of the
word that I understand it.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.739 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I do feel a sense of mission,
but does that

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.992 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
make me a missionary?
I hope not.

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:58.077 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
What's wrong with
being a missionary?

00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Well, I don't want to
knock on doors and tell people

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.164 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
how they should think and
how they should behave,

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:05.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
what they should believe and
that they should believe

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
anything in particular.
What I do want to do

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.006 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in my presentation,
in my personal work,

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.591 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is to say, please look at this.
Please consider this.

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.552 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Think about this.
This is what's alleged.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This is what
we claim we can prove.

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This is what's
still speculative.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
What does this mean?

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:25.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's a non-bizarre delusion.
So you ask the question,

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
what's a bizarre delusion versus
what's a non-bizarre delusion?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
A non-bizarre delusion
could very well be

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:37.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that extraterrestrials
have contacted somebody.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
But the person

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:43.581 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
might be diagnosed
with delusional disorder.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Again, it doesn't mean
it's not true.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And this is where
things get ambiguous.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:56.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So, you know, I for one can
live with the ambiguity of it.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:01.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Um... I'd kind of like
to think that, you know,

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:04.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
extraterrestrials
have contacted us.

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:06.479 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I'd like to believe that, and
I'd like to see the evidence.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:10.983 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Together with Asket I traveled
around, and was also able to

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.573 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
make trips into the past with
her and also into the future,

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:20.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but I don't want to talk about
the travels into the future.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:24.121 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;I not only told friends,
but also other people

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.167 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
about the future,
and some of them even

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:31.253 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
misused that information
and tried to make money from it

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:33.339 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and were
sentenced and imprisoned.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:35.549 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.684 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;If a person could
really really know the future

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it would be,
probably an enormous burden,

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:51.273 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
depending on
what we're talking about.

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.401 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
But, certainly,
if you saw events

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:56.404 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that were going to occur with
certainty,

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
however that would be possible,
and these were negative events,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.078 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
disasters, etc, that would be
a terribly disturbing thing.

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:06.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Knowing that one

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
could not change or alter that
would be enormously frustrating.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:13.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He claims to have met a man
called Jmmanuel, and Jmmanuel,

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:15.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
according to
the information in the case,

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:19.009 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
would be the man
whom we know as Jesus Christ.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Or, at least, the Jesus Christ
figure would be,

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.097 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
according to
the Meier material,

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:27.101 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a fictionalized version
of a real man

00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:30.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
who lived 2000-some years ago,
who indeed was crucified

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.314 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
but survived the crucifixion.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:35.192 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;When Jmmanuel lived,
he was later falsely named

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Jesus Christ, and
he never had anything to do with

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the religion which was made
from his teachings.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.456 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:51.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Jmmanuel was not
an extraterrestrial.

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.669 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He was therefore
a human being from this world

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.839 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
begotten by an extraterrestrial
with a terrestrial woman

00:20:56.839 --> 00:21:01.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
named Mary, and was born here on
the Earth as an Earth human.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.095 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:10.769 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;And where did Asket
present you to him?

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:14.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I don't actually want to say
anything about that.

00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:17.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
What is the Talmud Jmmanuel?

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:19.195 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The Talmud Jmmanuel
is a document.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:22.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It came about when Billy Meier
and Isa Rashid, who was

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:26.494 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a former Greek Orthodox priest,
were led telepathically to

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:30.039 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
an area outside of Jerusalem,
by the Plejaren, and they

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:34.543 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
found and dug their way
into an abandoned ancient tomb.

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:37.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The stones in the floor,
concealed for a while,

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.757 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
for 2,000 years apparently,

00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:43.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
resin-encrusted
animal-skin-wrapped scrolls,

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:47.056 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which they took out
and removed from that location.

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:49.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When they opened up one
they found they were in Aramaic.

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:53.771 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So Isa Rashid took the scrolls,
and began a translation process.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In something like seven years,
he sent Meier

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:58.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
about one-third of these
scrolls, translated

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:02.071 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
from the Aramaic, in which they
originally were, into German.

00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:05.157 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He let Meier know that
he was now virtually on the run

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
with his family for their lives.

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:10.329 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He told Meier that there were
certain religious factions

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:13.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of a couple major religions
that found out that he had these

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:16.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
scrolls, and they wanted to take
possession of them themselves.

00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:20.464 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The information would prove
to be enormously heretical.

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:23.175 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
After Isa Rashid
had translated a chunk of them,

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:27.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
he took them and his family into
a refugee village in Lebanon,

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.223 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
hid the scrolls in the walls.

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:30.683 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's said that within about
a week's time, the Israelis

00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:34.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
came in and destroyed
the entire village.

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The scrolls were destroyed,
along with many of the

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
structures and people,
who lost their lives.

00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:41.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Isa Rashid and his family
escaped with their lives

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
into Iraq.
And four years later,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Meier found out that

00:22:46.407 --> 00:22:49.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Isa Rashid and his entire family
had been machine-gunned to death

00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:53.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
ostensibly by
the Mossad in Baghdad.

00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:57.209 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For instance, Jmmanuel foretold
the coming of another prophet.

00:22:57.209 --> 00:23:00.129 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He named him as Mohammed.
He claimed that, while this man

00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:01.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
would be a true prophet,

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:03.632 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
his teachings would
also be corrupted and

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a false and evil cult
would be created from them

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:09.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that would give the Israeli
people, the distant descendants,

00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
no peace until the end of time,
unless, hopefully, both

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Israelis and their enemies
could make a conciliatory

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and honest peace
with each other.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The Talmud of Jmmanuel
contains prophecies

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:23.485 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
about the fires
that would darken the sky

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
when greedy and
power-hungry people would ignite

00:23:25.613 --> 00:23:27.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the very oil of the earth.

00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:30.743 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The Talmud Jmmanuel
was discovered in 1963.

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:35.122 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The fires from the Gulf War
that darkened the skies

00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:39.585 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
did not occur until 1991,
18 years after the Talmud

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.462 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
was discovered.
There are two artifacts

00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:44.214 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that are shown in this book
that Meier discovered

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:47.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in the tomb where the Talmud
Jmmanuel was discovered.

00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:49.637 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
The first one was
a small figurine,

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:54.600 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that Meier says was left by the
Indian healers with Jmmanuel,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.354 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the men who came and ministered
to Him over those three days

00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
while He was
sequestered in the tomb.

00:24:00.022 --> 00:24:02.691 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The other artifact is
a piece of gypsum that

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:05.527 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Gabriel allegedly
gave to Jmmanuel.

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:08.405 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Both of these were left
for Meier to discover

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:11.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
as he did centuries later.

00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:15.245 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:19.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;When I was in India in 1964,
I lived in the Ashoka Ashram

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:22.586 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
outside of Mehrauli
with a monk named Dharmawara,

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.755 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
from whom I also
learned a great deal.

00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:27.216 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It was then that
the opportunity arose

00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:30.344 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
for the first time for me
to photograph spaceships,

00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:32.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that is to say, beamships.

00:24:32.513 --> 00:24:35.724 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:45.234 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;And that is my grandfather
when he was in his late 80's,

00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:49.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and myself a year and a half
before I left to come to the

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:51.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
United States to persue
my university studies.

00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:54.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As I continued my university
studies, I had forgotten

00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:58.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
all about that contact.
It never stayed in a place

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:01.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in my mind where it is utilized.

00:25:01.709 --> 00:25:07.756 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I went on finishing my graduate
work, went to help my country,

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:11.969 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
became a diplomat,
was sent back to New York

00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:17.141 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to represent my country
at the United Nations,

00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:19.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
worked at it for 12 years.

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:22.604 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
One day I was cleaning,
and came across the book again.

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So I thought, before I throw
it away I should look at it.

00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:28.777 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I opened the page and saw
the name Ashoka Ashram.

00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So I was wondering, how could
our place be named in this book?

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
As I browsed through it,
I saw the stories,

00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:41.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and immediately I thought,
I bet you it was

00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:43.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the same Swiss person
that had stayed at our place

00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:47.337 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
when I was a child, if he's the
person that I knew...

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:49.506 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
if he has the monkey,
it's the same person.

00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:53.218 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So Wendelle wrote to him,
and I think Wendelle said

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:57.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
within an hour Billy wrote back.
A few months later I flew out.

00:25:57.598 --> 00:26:02.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We sat and talked for three
straight nights without sleep.

00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:05.481 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was almost like...
I felt I had returned home,

00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:08.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and he felt he had returned home
[laughs]

00:26:08.192 --> 00:26:11.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So it's just sharing of
some part of him that he has

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:14.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
not been able to share so much
with a lot of people before.

00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:19.453 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
She seems like
her body language is congruent,

00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:22.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so it's, in other words,
when she's speaking, her hands

00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:27.669 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
move with whatever is going on.
She's saying, I remember this.

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:30.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Typically if I was lying
I wouldn't throw

00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
something like that in, 'cause
I'm trying to get through it

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
as quick as possible.
So she goes into little snippets

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:42.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of the story... I would say that
the way she's presenting it,

00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:45.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
either she's rehearsed it really
well or this is...

00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:48.023 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
she's telling
what she believes in.

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:50.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So this ship would appear,
usually would be around

00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:54.488 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the same time as I have the
visitation or sometime...

00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:56.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
this was taken by Billy Meier.

00:26:56.698 --> 00:27:00.327 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's 1965, it's a very hot day
in Turkey. Meier gets on a bus,

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:02.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
sits next to the window,
sticks his arm out.

00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:06.542 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
[Meier speaking German]

00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:09.086 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;When another bus,
whose driver was drunk,

00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:12.422 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
drove towards us and rammed us,
I was hurled out the window and

00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:14.716 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
my left arm was 
smashed and crushed

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to such a degree that
it had to be amputated.

00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:29.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
For the next month
he wanders around hallucinating.

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:33.068 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The police recognize him--
they knew him as The Phantom.

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Instead of shooting him on the
spot, they took care of him

00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:37.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
until he was well enough
to proceed on his way.

00:27:41.201 --> 00:27:44.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Whereby it must be said that
after the accident I first

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:49.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
went down to Kuwait delirious.
What I had done simply wasn't

00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:53.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
appropriate, I don't want to be
persuaded into talking about it.

00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:59.011 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Asket told me that through this
I will learn things with regard

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:02.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to self control, dealing with my
own thoughts and feelings,

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:05.434 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
my psychology and so forth.

00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:08.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it turned out that,
actually, she was right.

00:28:17.237 --> 00:28:20.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I met my wife in Greece
after my accident in Iskenderun.

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The Corinth police helped us

00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
get the wedding papers, and then
we were officially arrested

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.504 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
only to be told at the police
station, well, you are now

00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:37.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
married and there is nothing
we can hold against you.

00:28:47.768 --> 00:28:50.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
My decision to marry this girl
had to do with an explanation

00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:53.982 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
by Asket in the 50's,
and earlier by Sfath,

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:57.611 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that I would meet this girl
one day and marry her.

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:03.992 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And it really turned out that
quite bad things resulted,

00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:08.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in that my marriage wasn't
happy, and so on and so forth.

00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:23.428 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Asket's and Sfath's explanation
was, were I to marry Kalliope,

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:26.014 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I would settle down and would
begin my mission and would

00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:29.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
perform this mission
no matter what.

00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:40.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The notion of,
"There was a Center"

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:44.199 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
didn't even occur to me until
I was maybe 7 or 8 years old.

00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:46.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
For me it was just
a patch of land

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in the green hills
of Switzerland.

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:50.414 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So I could be here,
discover things,

00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:52.541 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
discover nature,
ask questions about nature.

00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And of course, there were
many people surrounding me

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.587 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
from different
parts of the world.

00:29:57.587 --> 00:30:02.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;By chance I have found
a book in a shop and

00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:05.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I found a way to
all the pictures of Billy.

00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:07.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The name was
"Contact from the Pleiades".

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:10.017 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It was telling
all the story of Billy.

00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:14.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And I was very highly impressed,
then I tried to come here to see

00:30:14.688 --> 00:30:19.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where the refuge was and get
as many information as possible.

00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:29.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;My name is Bernadette Brand.
I actually come from

00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:32.748 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Hinterschmidruti, because
I've lived here for 30 years.

00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:35.625 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Friends had told me
amazing things about Billy,

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:38.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but, basically,
I didn't want to meet him.

00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:41.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Then I came into a situation
where I had to confront him, and

00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:45.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
was unbelievably surprised that
he accepted me exactly as I was.

00:30:51.391 --> 00:30:53.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;I come from
the north of Germany.

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:57.147 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In 1974, my first husband
died of cancer.

00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:59.649 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And then I was on
a search for the truth,

00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:02.611 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
searching for an answer
to, What is Death?

00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:05.322 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In addition,
there was the big question,

00:31:05.322 --> 00:31:07.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
What is the Meaning of Life?

00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:22.339 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;1977, I think, I read about
him twice in two journals,

00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:25.550 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but did not continue to pay
attention to it.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I thought such a contact
in Switzerland does not appear

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.473 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
realistic to me, but for a long
time I was interested in

00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:34.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
extraterrestrial life,
reincarnation

00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:35.519 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and related things.

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:37.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I pondered about
the meaning of life, and then...

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:40.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Well, I had once been a member
in an American association and

00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:43.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
read in the newsletter
about a Swiss farmer,

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:46.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and about a photo book about his
contacts with extraterrestrials.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.669 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;How do you know him?
&gt;&gt;Quite simple- he's my father.

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:05.340 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;So how was it as a child?
&gt;&gt;That was very difficult,

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.717 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because it didn't come
just from the children,

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:12.139 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
rather more from the adults who
then influenced the children,

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:15.308 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
especially in the early years
and partly even today

00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:18.103 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
he had a reputation
as a nutcase.

00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:28.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And there should be 
no contact with such a person,

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:30.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and this influenced 
the children.

00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:36.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This was expressed
in that I was

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:39.499 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
ignored or teased
by my classmates.

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:49.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Yes, that was difficult.

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I was successful in
repressing the memory of this,

00:32:52.262 --> 00:32:55.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and I don't mean just in a
transferred sense, but really.

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:04.232 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There are only a few episodes
that I still remember

00:33:04.232 --> 00:33:06.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
from the first
18, 20 years of my life.

00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:12.574 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Everything else is buried
in my subconscious, and

00:33:12.574 --> 00:33:16.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I've built up my individuality
by trying out many things,

00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
by getting around a lot,
by making the acquaintance

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:23.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of many people, but also
my making many mistakes.

00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Did you ever say to your 
father,"Dad, how could you 

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.602 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
"do this? Such a hard thing?"

00:33:40.602 --> 00:33:43.355 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;No, I never asked him
personally, but in secret

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:45.690 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I have often
asked myself this question.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I tried to analyze
the whole situation and...

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.155 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to break it down for myself,
and I came to the conclusion...

00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:02.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
...that it is more important
to build up the mission,

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:06.169 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to build up FIGU,
than to go into this problem.

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:25.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm not angry with my father
because of it.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:26.606 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Quite the contrary --
I'm glad and happy

00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:29.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that he is here for me
today in this form,

00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and I am trying to profit and
learn as much as I can from it.

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:42.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
My mother always tried

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to drive a wedge
between our father and us,

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:48.336 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and tried again and again
to incite us against him.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.763 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Well, she didn't succeed
in the end, and, overall,

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:02.017 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we have a good
relationship with our father.

00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:11.735 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He was on the road for 12 years
and, naturally, quite a bit

00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:16.114 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
comes together from real life--
that fascinated me.

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:19.034 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The people as such--
how they live, how they work,

00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:22.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
their way of thinking,
their hospitality.

00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:24.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Other countries, other customs--
that naturally expands one's

00:35:24.998 --> 00:35:28.460 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
horizons when one can
experience something like that.

00:35:37.177 --> 00:35:39.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And one day,
the question arose--

00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Jacobus, what do you make of
extraterrestrials?

00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:56.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Where the road enters the forest
there was a pile of long logs,

00:35:56.029 --> 00:35:59.282 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and very good photographs
were taken there.

00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:06.247 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Where are we going Billy?
&gt;&gt;Down to Ober-Sadelegg, 

00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:08.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
where we were able 
to take photographs 

00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:10.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of Semjase's beamship.

00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:29.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It was night, and
I heard a sound and steps.

00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:31.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
At that time,
I slept in the house trailer

00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:34.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
when I was over here
over the weekends.

00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:37.779 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I went outside because
I heard the name, "Eduard",

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:40.657 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and saw a large, white-haired
figure in the half-darkness.

00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:43.326 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Actually, it was more the
silhouette I could recognize,

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:48.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I simultaneously perceived,
"I have to retreat, stand still"

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.625 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And,
"Go back to the house trailer."

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:53.503 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was a wonderful feeling.
Somehow I was

00:36:53.503 --> 00:36:56.714 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
inwardly fulfilled with
happiness and light and sun

00:36:56.714 --> 00:37:00.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and so forth, and naturally,
I've never forgotten that.

00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:12.564 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Around 1990, I saw
the ionizing hulls of

00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
three research ships
from the Dal universe.

00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:18.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They were circling and
looked like misty balls.

00:37:18.611 --> 00:37:22.073 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I've also observed a mass
sighting of Asina's people.

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:25.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It was at that time when Asina
came to say farewell to Billy.

00:37:29.164 --> 00:37:31.749 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When I could take photographs
it was very unusual that

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:34.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
other people, group members,
could go with me

00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:36.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and take photographs themselves.

00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:39.007 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
As a rule, I always
had to go alone.

00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:45.555 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And halfway, I suddenly
had such a strange feeling,

00:37:45.555 --> 00:37:48.558 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
some kind of urge which
grew stronger and stronger.

00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:50.768 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And suddenly
I knew what I should do.

00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:55.482 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
I should look up.

00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:58.109 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There was a huge
cauliflower-like cloud,

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:02.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a quite big silvery shining disk
curved around the cloud.

00:38:07.494 --> 00:38:10.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And suddenly it vanished as if
it had been cut out of a film.

00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:20.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I had such a wistful feeling in
me. Something like homesickness.

00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:23.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In my thoughts, I was always
with this huge ship.

00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:35.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I had several sightings of
ships, UFOs, beamships,

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as they are called,
due to the fact that my father

00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:40.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
had contact with
the Plejaren,

00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:43.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and repeatedly said,
"I have been called once again."

00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:51.579 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
It has been a natural thing

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:53.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
as I had been a part of it
since childhood.

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:01.589 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It was here
on the Center's grounds

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
when Billy called that we should
come, and there was a

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.386 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
tiny, silvery point in the sky.

00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:08.304 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I was lucky three times
to have had the occasion

00:39:08.304 --> 00:39:11.015 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to photograph three UFOs.

00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:16.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Naturally, I didn't see them
when I took the photographs,

00:39:16.646 --> 00:39:19.607 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
only when I had the photographs
in my hand.

00:39:19.607 --> 00:39:21.693 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So it was by coincidence?
Yes.

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:32.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
While taking the photograph,
I saw a fiery, red, big disk

00:39:32.412 --> 00:39:35.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which didn't appear at all
on my photograph.

00:39:35.498 --> 00:39:39.586 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But what I also saw, and what
was also on the photo, was

00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:43.214 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
some glittering drizzle, which
sprayed down from that disk.

00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:51.723 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Once I was with other witnesses
when Semjase eliminated a

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:58.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
free-standing, approximately 3-5
meter tall fir tree in a meadow.

00:39:58.187 --> 00:40:00.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It suddenly disappeared.

00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:07.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The apple,
which is still preserved today

00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in this glass jar,
has been here now

00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:14.579 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
for around 30 years.
In spite of that, in my view,

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:19.042 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it still looks
exactly as good as it did then.

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:26.716 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We're not just dealing
with an ordinary apple

00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:30.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because it was not grown
in a terrestrial garden.

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Rather, it comes from a food
garden, or a greenhouse,

00:40:39.646 --> 00:40:43.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which is situated in spaceship
commander Jschwjsch Ptaah's

00:40:43.358 --> 00:40:45.652 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
huge mother ship.

00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:48.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This is what's special
about this apple.

00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Unfortunately,
almost nobody has accepted

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.582 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
this apple story of mine.

00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:15.556 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Back there long logs were lying
where the road curves

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:18.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and beyond, at the curve
just in front of the forest,

00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:20.478 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
there where it goes
into the forest,

00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:23.356 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I once made recordings
of the whirring sounds of

00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:25.483 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Semjase's beamship.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.322 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You could hear it
over a very big area,

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
up to a distance
of 4 kilometers.

00:41:37.078 --> 00:41:40.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Wendelle Stevens, Lee Elders and
Tom Welch got a measuring device

00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:43.793 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
from Weil Limited,
up in Rheintal.

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:53.094 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Accompanied with electronic
devices, and measured

00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:57.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the distance from here to there,
about 380 meters,

00:41:57.306 --> 00:42:01.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which made it possible for the
sounds to be recorded from here.

00:42:09.444 --> 00:42:16.117 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
[pulsing, high-pitched sound]

00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:25.293 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
What's happening is
the ten different frequencies

00:42:25.293 --> 00:42:28.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
are converging
on one central frequency

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.214 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
which is, I find,
very interesting.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.258 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This is probably one of
the most interesting things

00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:35.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
about the tape
is that there are...

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
What's this right now?
Very, very many tones.

00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:40.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Yeah. And they're all changing
very fast.

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:43.144 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There aren't synthesizers on the
market that have oscillators

00:42:43.144 --> 00:42:46.647 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that change that randomly, even
if you got 9 or 10 of them

00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:50.693 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
going, they wouldn't change from
those peaks that quickly.

00:42:50.693 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So the significant thing
is this rate of change.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.489 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And besides,
if you were going to create

00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:57.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a noise for a spaceship,
you'd be hard put

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to come up with something as
original as this.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;I would see it once a week
or sometimes twice a week,

00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:06.459 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
ships over the Ashoka Ashram.
But from an angle.

00:43:06.459 --> 00:43:09.670 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Behind Ashoka Ashram
there is a little hill,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and we used to call it
Dark Hill.

00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:18.179 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This was taken on May 24, 1964.
This was taken just on the side

00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:20.765 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
towards the east of the ashram.

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:22.683 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Sometimes I would see
more than two,

00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:24.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
there would be
a whole bunch of them.

00:43:24.685 --> 00:43:29.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Taken from monuments in that
area, it's called [unclear],

00:43:29.524 --> 00:43:31.776 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
this is an old
Indian historical monument.

00:43:31.776 --> 00:43:34.153 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Very interesting
and also important to me,

00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:35.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
a whole bunch of them.

00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:39.492 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But this is one of my aya
washing my clothes,

00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
sitting on the veranda
outside of my room.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
When I had my experiences,
I have seen a lot of ships

00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:50.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
over the trees, near the well,
on the Dark Hill.

00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:53.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Sometimes it was very low.
I could see a huge,

00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:56.717 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
half-of-this-room-sized
of the ship.

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:59.637 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So when I had experiences
with Asket it was also

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:02.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
not something very unusual
or strange for me.

00:44:02.682 --> 00:44:08.062 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It was almost a return
to some familiar state.

00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:11.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Sometimes there would be
a few villagers walking around

00:44:11.566 --> 00:44:13.484 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and they would
look up and see this.

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:16.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the ashram itself
sometimes a servant would come

00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:19.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and say, I saw something
very strange, have you seen...

00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:21.576 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I would say, "Yes."
And that was the end of it.

00:44:21.576 --> 00:44:26.205 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This is right on top of the
ashram, in the evening.

00:44:26.205 --> 00:44:30.585 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Sometimes there would be people
looking up with me, looking up.

00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:34.589 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And some of them would see the
ship very clearly, like myself.

00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:37.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But some would look around
and said, I don't see it.

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:39.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is
one of the phenomena where

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:41.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
hundreds of people saw this.

00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:44.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Even was written in the Indian
newspaper in the 60's.

00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:48.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Actually, one reporter was
dispatched from the newspaper,

00:44:48.769 --> 00:44:50.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think The New Statesman,
or something.

00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:53.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He came,
talked to the villagers,

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:55.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
talked to people
who work at our place,

00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:59.488 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and even talked to Billy,
and was shown the photos.

00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:07.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
During my night watch,
I parked my car just here,

00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:11.292 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
everything was dark here, and I
came walking along this road.

00:45:15.171 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
As I was walking along,
Ptaah in his shiny little ship

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
came over this hill,
brightly illuminated

00:45:21.594 --> 00:45:24.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
between the trees
over the tent there.

00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:37.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The whole situation after 25
years is somewhat normal,

00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:40.988 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and we deal with such unusual
phenomena quite differently.

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.037 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I had another
interesting experience,

00:45:48.037 --> 00:45:52.333 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I guess it was in February 2001
I wrote about it.

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:55.169 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I drove my car into the
protection shield

00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:57.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of a telemeter disk.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.553 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
That means that I touched

00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:07.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the electro-energetic protection
shield of that disk with my car,

00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:11.477 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the whole car was enveloped
in a huge ball of light.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
It was as if

00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:23.155 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
my car and I were struck by a
very strong electrical tension.

00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:33.207 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In the mid 80's,
I was on vacation in Italy.

00:46:33.207 --> 00:46:37.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And one night about 11,
I had an impulse and I looked,

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:41.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and there were two lights,
quite parallel, very fast.

00:46:41.048 --> 00:46:44.093 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And then they whooshed! passed.
And then I knew--

00:46:44.093 --> 00:46:46.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Yeah, that was it.

00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:56.564 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I have certainly never
yet seen extraterrestrials.

00:46:56.564 --> 00:46:59.942 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But spaceships, yeah,
something silvery in the sky...

00:46:59.942 --> 00:47:01.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Well, I have to say that

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:04.405 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I have simply never been
interested in spaceships.

00:47:04.405 --> 00:47:08.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Spaceships are, for me, like
cars. I'm not interested

00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:11.579 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in cars, either. They are a
means of transportation.

00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:14.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But what has always been clear
to me, and what I never

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.460 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
quite realized, was that it
was clear to me that, logically

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
there are extraterrestrials.
We here on earth certainly

00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:24.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
are not the only ones
in this huge universe.

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:28.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;So, Mike, what's this
photograph that we see here?

00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:31.432 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;This is a photograph that
Billy Meier took in 1975

00:47:31.432 --> 00:47:34.977 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of a landed UFO,
the only one of this type

00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:37.188 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that he was able to take.
It was from this photograph

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:41.192 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that the special effects expert
Wally Gentleman, who had been a

00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:46.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
director of special effects
on 2001, designed and had made

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:50.076 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
two UFO models at the
MGM special effects studio.

00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:54.413 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In these photographs we see
Billy Meier with those models.

00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:56.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;You mean 2001, the Kubrick
film? &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:04.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;And what's the difference
between these models versus,

00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:07.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you know, photographs that Billy
Meier took of actual UFOs?

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Well, I think we're going to
take a look at some of that.

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:14.100 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For instance here we can see in
this film the model of...

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:18.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
one of the models being handheld
and walked about the property.

00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:21.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There were very specific
technical differences

00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:24.652 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that were observed, but
in this film we see an object

00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:27.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that some people
might say is a model.

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:30.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's hovering above
what appears to be a tree,

00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:33.369 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and in front of a house.
&gt;&gt;Is this one of his films?

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;This is one of
Billy Meier's films,

00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:36.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
his earliest film from 1975.

00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:38.499 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Some people would think
by a string, but

00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:41.168 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as you see this move
off to the side, you notice

00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:44.046 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the UFO hung for a moment
at an angle, which is something

00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:48.509 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that's impossible to effect
with an object on a string.

00:48:48.509 --> 00:48:49.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;But it looks like so shaky and

00:48:49.635 --> 00:48:51.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
like being pulled up and down.

00:48:51.345 --> 00:48:53.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:48:53.347 --> 00:48:54.598 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;And is this the usual way
that they fly?

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:57.059 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;No, this was
a demonstration flight, and

00:48:57.059 --> 00:48:59.186 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
some of what was accomplished
here was the characteristic,

00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to be expected movements
would come from an object,

00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:04.525 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a pendulum-like object,
an object on a string.

00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:07.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then we see these other
smooth and flowing movements

00:49:07.695 --> 00:49:12.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as the UFO is moving about the
tree. We are told that this

00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:14.702 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
was done for a couple of
reasons. One, to actually

00:49:14.702 --> 00:49:18.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
demonstrate flight in a
terrestrial environment.

00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:22.626 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And two, to also give an out to
skeptics who would have to say,

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:25.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"This cannot be
an object from outer space."

00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:28.340 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It would be too threatening
to their belief systems.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.217 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
However, at a certain point
we can actually see

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:35.723 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the top of this tree swaying
under the backwash of the UFO.

00:49:35.723 --> 00:49:39.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And if we look back at
the very opening of this film,

00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:42.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we will notice that there is a
great deal of space between

00:49:42.438 --> 00:49:46.358 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the UFO and the sky,
making it very, very unlikely

00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:50.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that it could be
an object suspended on a string.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.990 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;And why is this film so like,
blurry and like...

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
it looks like an old film.
&gt;&gt;Well, it is an old film,

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
shot in 1975 on a snowy and
rainy day, according to Meier,

00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:03.584 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and shot from a distance.
So what we're seeing here

00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:08.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is a rather poor quality film,
to be sure, and we're just

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:11.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
having to make the best of it
ourselves and our understanding.

00:50:11.383 --> 00:50:12.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;Is this tree
still there today?

00:50:12.718 --> 00:50:16.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;The tree is no longer there,
as is the case in a couple of

00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:19.767 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the other films and photographs
that Meier took.

00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:22.436 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;Now what do we see here?
&gt;&gt;Here is a clearer,

00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:25.481 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a much clearer film segment
that Meier took with

00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:28.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a UFO hovering above a road,
and we can see a car moving

00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:31.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
slowly to the left
in the bottom...

00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:33.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Oh yeah, that white dot there.
&gt;&gt;Yeah, the white dot.

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:34.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We're gonna see
another one in a moment.

00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:37.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We also notice that there is a
tree branch with some leaves

00:50:37.576 --> 00:50:40.788 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to the left.
Meier was encouraged oftentimes

00:50:40.788 --> 00:50:43.499 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to have objects in the
foreground for perspective,

00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:45.793 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and calculating the distance.
Here, the craft

00:50:45.793 --> 00:50:48.629 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
has moved suddenly to the left,
and is exhibiting

00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:52.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a characteristic floating motion
that we're told is really

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the craft riding on
the magnetic field of the earth.

00:50:57.304 --> 00:51:00.057 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
In this film,
we can see an object,

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:03.477 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
a toy made in the 1990's,
invented by physicists,

00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:07.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it's called a Levitron, that
exhibits this type of movement

00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:09.775 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
as this object,
in these repeated frames,

00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:14.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
floats above the base.
We dissolve here

00:51:14.113 --> 00:51:17.074 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
into Meier's UFO,
as it, too, is exhibiting

00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:19.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that type of
hovering, pulsing movement

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:22.496 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on the magnetic field
of the earth, as he was told.

00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:25.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now watch as the object
will suddenly dart away,

00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:28.502 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in one frame
disappearing from view.

00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:31.130 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;How is that possible?
&gt;&gt;Meier was told that

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.424 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they have technologies
that allow them to move

00:51:33.424 --> 00:51:35.676 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
out of phase,
out of dimension,

00:51:35.676 --> 00:51:38.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
within a part of a second.

00:51:38.679 --> 00:51:41.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They can not only move
out of dimension that quickly,

00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:44.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
they can also pop
back into dimension.

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:47.604 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
When the films
were examined at Nippon TV,

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:50.482 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they discover that, indeed,
there had been no cutting,

00:51:50.482 --> 00:51:53.652 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and that the object not only
disappears in one frame,

00:51:53.652 --> 00:51:57.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but pops back in in one frame,
just as suddenly,

00:51:57.364 --> 00:51:59.199 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
as you'll see here.

00:52:01.744 --> 00:52:04.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;So, where does it go
while it's gone?

00:52:04.038 --> 00:52:06.623 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Well, that's a good question.
As we observe it here disappear

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:10.377 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
one more time, we can wonder
just exactly where it goes.

00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:13.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I don't have an answer for it.

00:52:13.714 --> 00:52:17.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That's Billy Meier
in the lower middle of the film.

00:52:17.551 --> 00:52:20.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He's walked into the film.
He'd set up his camera

00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:23.057 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
on the tripod,
as we again see one of the UFOs

00:52:23.057 --> 00:52:27.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
hovering in the distance.
And again, notice that it

00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:30.606 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
has this movement, this slight,
pulsing, up and down movement

00:52:30.606 --> 00:52:33.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
as it rides on
the magnetic field of the earth.

00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:37.613 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;And this film?
&gt;&gt;This film, Meier has the UFO.

00:52:37.613 --> 00:52:41.450 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
As it comes in closer
he also zooms in on it a bit,

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.495 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and we will see two very
dramatic effects of a light

00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:46.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
flashing there from the top.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.248 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
?Oh, Yeah.
&gt;&gt;You see it?

00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.666 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And then
from the rim of the ship.

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:51.752 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Why is it flashing like that?
&gt;&gt;That was not explained.

00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:54.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
As a matter of fact,
when Meier mentioned it to them,

00:52:54.254 --> 00:52:57.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to the extraterrestrials, they
were surprised at that effect,

00:52:57.466 --> 00:52:59.676 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and they wanted
to see the film, too.

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:05.099 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We see it again go on... there.
Now, as you watch this film,

00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:08.727 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you're going to be able to
observe more clearly that

00:53:08.727 --> 00:53:11.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the craft is actually
above the earth. There's

00:53:11.105 --> 00:53:15.984 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a bit of a hill or mountain
just below the timecodes there.

00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:17.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
So, clearly,

00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:20.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
this was photographed outside.
This was filmed outside.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And this is 
one of the films

00:53:22.241 --> 00:53:24.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that the owners of
Uncharted Territory,

00:53:24.743 --> 00:53:27.663 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the Academy-Award-winning
special effects house,

00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:30.290 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
they viewed this film
and determined that

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:32.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
it was not a hoax.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:40.467 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
In this film we see

00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:41.760 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
three of the UFOs,
again in the distance

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
with tree branches
in the foreground,

00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
as they hover

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
at slightly different angles
in relationship to each other,

00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:53.397 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
exhibiting again the pulsing
movement and changing distance,

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:56.316 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
ever so minutely,
between them.

00:53:58.485 --> 00:54:00.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Uncharted Territory said that,
if they could duplicate

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:04.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Meier's films, they would have
to go to CGI to do it,

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:09.371 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
because these clearly
are not models.

00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:10.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt;And what is 
this right here?

00:54:10.289 --> 00:54:12.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;This is the beginning of
a series of photographs

00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:15.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that Meier took of what's 
called a light or energy ship,

00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:19.173 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
allegedly piloted by beings
from the Andromeda Galaxy

00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:22.593 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who are partially physical
and partially non-physical.

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:25.721 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Very high level,
high energy beings.

00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:28.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They did not communicate
directly with Meier,

00:54:28.348 --> 00:54:30.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and he could not
communicate with them.

00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:32.478 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Interestingly enough,
Lee and Brit Elders, two of the

00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:34.521 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
original investigators
on the case, claim that

00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:38.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
they also saw a phenomenon
in the night skies like this

00:54:38.484 --> 00:54:42.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in Switzerland while they
were investigating the case.

00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:44.448 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Photoshop expert David Biedny
claimed that Meier had

00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:47.367 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
simply used a light fixture
photographed against

00:54:47.367 --> 00:54:51.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a black background
to hoax these photographs,

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:55.334 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in particular one that he
claimed was a double exposure.

00:54:55.334 --> 00:54:57.503 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When another
special effects movie expert,

00:54:57.503 --> 00:55:00.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who had been in the business
for 50 years, viewed

00:55:00.047 --> 00:55:03.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the same photograph that we're
about to see in just a moment,

00:55:03.175 --> 00:55:06.053 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
he said that it was not
a double exposure at all,

00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:08.555 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but a triple exposure
that must have been taken

00:55:08.555 --> 00:55:12.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
accidentally in the camera.
When Mr. Biedny was challenged

00:55:12.518 --> 00:55:15.187 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to duplicate this photo
to prove his point,

00:55:15.187 --> 00:55:17.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
he declined to even try.

00:55:17.356 --> 00:55:18.565 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Is it
this photograph right here?

00:55:18.565 --> 00:55:21.193 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;This is the one.
Now, in the next one, this one,

00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:24.363 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which is clearly not
a double exposure, Mr. Biedny

00:55:24.363 --> 00:55:26.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
wouldn't even comment on it.

00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:28.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This poses a problem
for the skeptics because

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's clear that it
was not done outside the camera.

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;And what is this thing
that looks so interesting?

00:55:33.747 --> 00:55:35.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;Well, that's our
wedding cake UFO.

00:55:35.457 --> 00:55:37.584 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This was the only other
landed UFO that Meier

00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:41.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
was able to take photographs of,
and interestingly enough,

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:44.174 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in very much the same location
as the energy ship

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:47.219 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
when it was photographed
in the previous photographs

00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:49.555 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
right above the Center.

00:55:49.555 --> 00:55:51.598 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We see here
a more clear view

00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:55.102 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of the base of the ship
taken from this angle,

00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:59.356 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and as we get closer to it,
even a little more clarity.

00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:03.694 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
These photos of the wedding cake
UFO were called hoaxes by many

00:56:03.694 --> 00:56:06.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
people who thought that it was
merely a garbage can lid

00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:11.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with various appliances and
accessories somehow put onto it.

00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:13.704 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
However,
when the original investigators

00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:16.123 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
were able to calculate
the measurement,

00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:18.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
it turned out to be
some ten feet in diameter.

00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:21.670 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
When they took these photos
to a metallurgist to ask

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
if he could reproduce it
in 1980 or '81, he said that

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:30.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it would cost about 25,000
dollars to make this object.

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Here, an even larger
wedding cake UFO is photographed

00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:37.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
over a van on Meier's property,
and Meier photographs it as well

00:56:37.603 --> 00:56:39.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
from underneath.
These are

00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:42.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
very controversial photographs
of the wedding cake UFO

00:56:42.524 --> 00:56:45.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
glowing a golden color at night.

00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:48.071 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Here you can see
various artifacts, trees,

00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:51.617 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and perhaps light poles
in the background.

00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:55.662 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In this next photograph
Meier has a close up of it.

00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:58.749 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Even larger,
closer to the camera.

00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:05.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And here, a telemeter disk
moves off to the side,

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.592 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and the photograph
of the tree and the car

00:57:08.592 --> 00:57:10.177 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
cause problems for skeptics
who claim that this is just

00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:13.347 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
a model tree and a model car.

00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:16.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Here we can see the most
dramatic of those photos

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:19.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as Meier photographs, focusing
on the distant, large UFO,

00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:22.648 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which is behind the car
and not in front of it.

00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:26.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Here the object...
it is now clearer, hovering,

00:57:26.526 --> 00:57:30.405 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and we can see the base of the
UFO at night, as it glows

00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:34.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
golden color, with various
protuberances underneath.

00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:38.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In this next photograph,
the center, or the core,

00:57:38.038 --> 00:57:41.500 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the top core of the UFO,
the sleeve has been extended.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If you take your time
to do some measurements on it,

00:57:43.627 --> 00:57:46.546 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you'll see that it's actually
a different configuration.

00:57:46.546 --> 00:57:50.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;When was this video taken?
&gt;&gt;This was taken in 1981,

00:57:50.717 --> 00:57:55.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
outside. Meier has
the camera set up.

00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:59.601 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is his first video camera,
and the UFO here is about

00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:01.978 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
two to three hundred feet
in the distance,

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:03.563 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
as best we can calculate.

00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:06.358 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Meier snaps some of the
photographs here.

00:58:06.358 --> 00:58:09.236 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He'll then leave the frame,
he'll go out of frame

00:58:09.236 --> 00:58:12.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
again for awhile
before coming back in.

00:58:12.406 --> 00:58:15.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Some skeptics
had claimed that this was really

00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:18.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
false perspective, that it was
a small model tree set up

00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:21.707 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
close to the camera.
For anybody that's been

00:58:21.707 --> 00:58:24.668 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to Switzerland, rural parts
as well, and especially

00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:29.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
near where Meier lives,
many solitary trees appear

00:58:29.548 --> 00:58:34.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
on these hillsides. And they
look all too good to be true

00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:36.430 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
unless you're familiar with the
fact that there's

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:39.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a very vibrant life force,
the trees are clear,

00:58:39.099 --> 00:58:42.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
solitary in many occasions here.
This solitary tree has

00:58:42.644 --> 00:58:47.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the UFO hovering virtually
motionlessly in front of it.

00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:48.608 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;How is that possible?
In the other films

00:58:48.608 --> 00:58:51.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it was moving,
here it's like standing still.

00:58:51.111 --> 00:58:54.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Well, it seems that the UFOs
can be controlled consciously

00:58:54.614 --> 00:58:58.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
by the Plejaren. People
have to think that through

00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:01.079 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
for themselves and
see if they accept that idea.

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.417 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This is a photograph, formerly
a top secret photograph,

00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:08.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of one of the Nazi UFOs,
the German UFOs

00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:10.338 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that were developed
during the early part

00:59:10.338 --> 00:59:13.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the Second World War,
supposedly with the help

00:59:13.008 --> 00:59:15.010 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of extraterrestrials,

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:18.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who upon further determining
the nefarious intentions

00:59:18.513 --> 00:59:22.476 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the Nazis, input, into the
designs. elements that

00:59:22.476 --> 00:59:25.479 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
caused these craft to
not be able to function

00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:27.647 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
as the Germans
had hoped they would.

00:59:27.647 --> 00:59:31.526 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Nonetheless, it's said that
during the Second World War

00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:34.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there was an intense
bombing run by the allies.

00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:38.033 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
800 bombers were sent up.
Only two of these craft

00:59:38.033 --> 00:59:41.703 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
were sent up and were able to
destroy 200 of the allied

00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:45.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
bombers, according to Lieutenant
Colonel Wendelle Stevens.

00:59:45.749 --> 00:59:48.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;How did the Nazis
supposedly get these UFOs?

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:51.087 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Supposedly they were helped
by an extraterrestrial race

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:53.423 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that thought that
the Germans at the time

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:56.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
would develop and utilize
these craft to bring about

00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:58.720 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
a more peaceful world here.

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And this only goes to show that,
extraterrestrial or not,

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.518 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
whenever human beings are
involved in something,

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:07.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
things can and
ultimately will get messed up.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;You mean, they talked
to the Nazis and gave them UFOs?

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:14.361 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;They apparently input the
information telepathically

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:18.114 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to, at the time,
German scientists

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:20.742 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who were unaware
of the contacts themselves.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.619 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They thought
that they were developing

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.121 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
these objects themselves.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:29.209 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And after the Second World War
some of these objects survived,

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:33.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and some of the Germans fled
to South America with them.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:36.550 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Different countries came into
possession of these plans,

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:40.053 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
such as the United States,
Canada, Russia and England.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:42.681 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Other countries as well, later,
such as France and China,

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:46.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
developed this type of
alternative craft which,

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:49.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
while it does not
have the capability of

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:53.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
true interplanetary, let alone
interstellar spacecraft,

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:58.738 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is used even today to create
UFO sightings around the world.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:01.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So we are told
by the Plejaren and Meier,

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:04.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that the greater majority
of so-called UFO sightings

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:10.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
are actually craft that are US
and other secret military craft,

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:14.671 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the danger still being that
a false UFO/ET attack

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:18.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
could be launched by one country
or another in order to

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:23.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
bring people under martial law
and worldwide control.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
These are the only known
photographs taken from

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:30.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
within a UFO above the earth
with two other UFOs visible.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:33.690 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Meier took these
from inside Semjase's ship.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In this final photograph
we even get a clearer view

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of the earth and land below.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:43.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're looking at photographs
taken of Meier holding

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:47.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a laser beam type weapon
on July 6th, 1977.

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:50.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The photographer is
the woman Minara who brought him

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:54.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
this weapon, an antique
600-year-old beam-type weapon.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.629 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;He looks a lot
younger here than in the movie.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;He was
about 40 years old at this time.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;And this is like
another film of his?

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.720 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;This is shot on the same day.
This was actually

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.598 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the second time that the weapon
like this was brought to Meier,

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:09.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they decided to both
photograph and film him

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:12.103 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
handling the weapon
during this time.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:16.441 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;So does anyone else
ever touch this weapon,

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.318 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
or is Meier the only one?
&gt;&gt;Well, Meier was

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:22.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the only terrestrial person
to handle the weapon. There...

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:24.532 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Minara was the person
who brought it,

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:28.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and also another woman named
Alena. We'll see her

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.996 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in a little bit. We have some
photographs of her.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:33.041 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The weapon had some
very unusual characteristics.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt;Like what?

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:39.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Well, the weapon was said to
have a range of 37.2 kilometers,

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:42.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it had a screen on it
that Meier could look into

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:46.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and see up to that distance,
as if whatever he was looking at

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
was close at hand.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:50.225 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
All he had to do was
concentrate then on the target,

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:53.144 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
whether it would be
a little piece of a tree or

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:57.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
another vehicle or whatever,
and press the trigger,

01:02:57.524 --> 01:03:00.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
pull back on the trigger,
and that beam would travel

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:03.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as far as necessary to destroy
the object in question.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.491 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;So he could basically
steer the weapon with his mind?

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:09.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Well, this weapon wasn't
fully steerable with the mind.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:12.706 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It was more that he could
focus on whatever he wanted to.

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:15.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
He still had
to pull the trigger.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:17.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In their more recent technology,
they have weapons

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.588 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that are controlled by the mind,
so that only the so-called

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:25.593 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
owner of the weapon could
actually activate and use it.

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:28.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It doesn't require the use,
then, of a trigger, but rather

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:31.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is mentally controlled
by the weapon's owner.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.518 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We're looking at a film
made 30 years ago

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:38.440 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of a weapon that is at the time
allegedly 600 years old.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.067 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Who is this holding...?
&gt;&gt;This is Alena,

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:44.070 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
she's another extraterrestrial,
who comes from a very,very

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:48.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
distant system in space, and she
is holding the weapon here.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:51.369 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We see not only the weapon,
but this gold suit.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:52.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
What I should tell you is that

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when Wendelle Stevens
and the investigative team

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.584 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
first saw these photographs
and films, they thought,

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:01.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
number one, the weapon had to be
a toy, which they discovered

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:05.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it wasn't by searching out every
toy supplier in Switzerland,

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.969 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as well as toy stores,
and coming up with nothing.

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:11.056 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Likewise, they searched out
through sporting goods stores

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:14.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and clothing manufacturers
this type of an outfit

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.604 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as well as simply looking for
a fabric that would

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:21.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
behave and appear as the gold,
apparent gold, foil

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:25.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of Alena's outfit does.
They couldn't find that, either.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:27.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;And what is this?
What's with this tree?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, this is one of the two
trees that Meier shot holes

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
through using this weapon.
This appears to be

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.997 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the apple tree
about 10-12 inches in diameter.

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:38.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They couldn't even find,
the investigators

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:40.794 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
couldn't even find a drill bit
that long, and plus,

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.462 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as they examined the hole here,
they found out that

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:46.216 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
not only was it smooth as glass
all the way through,

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.678 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but slightly oval, in addition
to the round entrance and exit.

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:54.599 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
There is no possible way
of drilling an oval hole.

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:57.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;What about these pictures?
&gt;&gt;Well, this is another tree

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in the forest that Meier
had shot a hole through.

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:02.148 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The investigators had then
taken a string, tied it

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.692 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
around the trunk, ran it
through the hole and then

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:07.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
carried it back
all the way into the forest.

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:10.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They found that, in a straight
line from the entrance point

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:15.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of this hole, everything was
singed or burned perfectly all

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the way through as far as they
could walk it in the forest.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But remarkably,
there was no sap bubbling,

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:23.211 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
there was simply clean through,
immediate breaks

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:27.173 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in the branches and twigs where
the beam had passed through.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:30.552 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;...with any technology that I
know of, could not achieve this

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:35.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
on this earth's plane. I could
not explain the type of material

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:39.602 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that I have in its discreteness
by any known combination

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.021 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of materials. I could not
put it together myself.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;The elements that we found
were totally surprising.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:49.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The major element,
which is shown here, was

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:58.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the rare earth metal thulium.
And it was totally unexpected.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:05.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So now we've seen silicon, iron,
thulium, silver and copper.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:10.008 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
All in a specimen
about this big.

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:14.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When he examined the metal under
electron scanning microscope, he

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:18.600 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
then found the micro-machining
which was clear evidence to him

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that this was a deliberately
manufactured product.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:28.735 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We found evidence of what looks
like mechanical manipulation.

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:36.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
One sees now discrete marks in a
diagonal form in this direction,

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:40.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and marks in this direction.
But what is exciting,

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:44.417 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it looks like it's been plowed,
in other words a pressure,

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:47.420 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and there is a scarfing
on either side.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Do we know
what this metal is used for?

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:53.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;We're told that these metals
were representative of a

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:57.222 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
number of the different stages,
seven stages of manufacturing,

01:06:57.222 --> 01:07:00.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that the Plejaren go through
to create the metal for

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.018 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
their spacecraft.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:04.103 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;I don't know how beneficial
it would be for us.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:08.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They're always more advanced
than we are, so we're

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:12.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the savages in the jungle,
and that's not always beneficial

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:18.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
for the lesser-evolved person.
But they're here, they're here

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:22.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
studying us and we should know
about it, I think.

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:25.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;If these ETs exist,
why haven't they contacted us?

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:29.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Well, actually,
there's two answers.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:32.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Number one is they certainly did
try to contact us,

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:35.718 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
meaning the government of
the United States, in 1979.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.221 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There was a letter sent
to the Carter administration.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:42.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But when I read that letter,
I really understood why

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the contact didn't take place.
It really was demanding such

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.147 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
profound changes in the
consciousness of people

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.650 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in this country, that there was
really no chance that

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.736 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they were going to go for it.
Specifically that

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:56.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
President Carter and his
administration reveal,

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.616 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to the American people,
that all of the

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:02.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
religious beliefs here are based
on fantasy, nonsense and lies.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:05.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
All of the world coverage of
this case became a milestone

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:11.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in ufology, and of course the
wonderful pictures and movies.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:15.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
For the first time we had a
strong documented cases with

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:19.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
strong evidences, hard evidences
in video and photographs,

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:23.182 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
pieces of solid materials
from another world to analyze.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:28.187 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And also scores of testimonials
by Billy Meier of his contacts,

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:34.694 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
so I think that this moment
is enlightening in ufology.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:37.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Throughout history we know there
have been lots of times when,

01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:42.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you know, the world has
believed, for example, that 

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:46.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it was flat, and then it
was discovered that it wasn't.

01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:51.127 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And it only took maybe one or
two people to believe that.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:56.049 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, it's what we call
a "type 2" error in research,

01:08:56.049 --> 01:09:03.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in other words, that you reject
something that actually is true.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
[German]

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:10.188 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;The teaching of the spirit,
or the knowledge that is

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:13.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
transmitted to us by the
Plejaren is

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:16.986 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
so fundamentally different from
everything else here on earth.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
[German]

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:30.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;What I learned from Sfath, the
first Plejaren contact person,

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.586 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and that I could then process
everything and go around the

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:36.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
world with the help of a
Plejaren, and the great amount

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:39.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I also learned out there
in the world,

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.178 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the great knowledge I could
draw from the storage banks

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:46.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and also that from my own
thinking, my own realizations,

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:48.976 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I could then start
to fulfill the mission.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:56.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
All of this wasn't simply
information being given to me,

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.445 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
rather I had to work for it
all by myself.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:02.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The German language is
the best language that one can

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:05.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
actually have in the world in
order to precisely and clearly

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:09.455 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
explain everything just as it
really must be.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
What we are
disseminating from here,

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:16.337 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The Center in Hinterschmidruti,
is simply only a teaching,

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.464 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and we call that
the teaching of the spirit,

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:22.635 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
or spiritual teaching,
or the teaching of truth.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:26.764 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Consciousness-related evolution
is the real meaning of life.

[German]

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:40.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
About 400 different texts,
about 40 books, and

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:45.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
3,000 copies are printed of each
book, which makes 120,000 books.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
[rapid typing]

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:08.556 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;The universe is already
very, very old, and

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:12.768 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
everything took its time to come
into being, even human life.

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:16.481 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The beginning is the cause from
which the effect came about.

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:19.650 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It's the law of causality
which has to take effect.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
The meaning of life is

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the human being's evolution with
regard to his consciousness.

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.587 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;Billy, what is God?
&gt;&gt;God is

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:42.798 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
an imaginary figure which has
been created by human beings

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:45.635 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
so that they don't have to bear
responsibility themselves.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.804 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Rather
they can shift it onto a deity.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:52.558 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But "God", in and of itself, is
nothing other than a title for

01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:55.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a human being who is
very highly evolved.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
God is therefore not, what
human beings wrongly assume,

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:08.449 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that He is the creator,
the creator of life,

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:11.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the creator of the universe,
of space...

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:15.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
God is nothing other than a
title, be it Allah or Shiva etc.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:24.131 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The human being always tries
to set a power above himself,

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:25.591 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and he calls it, "God".

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.511 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This God, or this power, is
supposed to be responsible

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:32.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for him and everything and
anything that he says, does,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
thinks and feels and so forth,
and for his fate.

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:43.651 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The human being is solely
responsible for each and every

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:47.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
thing he thinks, does, feels
and undertakes.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:50.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
He must be responsible for it.

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:57.290 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He must bear and savor
all the positive and negative

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:01.043 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which he processes through his
thoughts, actions and feelings.

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:05.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's good that he invented a new
term called Creation, which is..

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:10.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I think maybe a bit broader.
Innocent, as well, you know?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If you say God or Allah,
then, you know, there is

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:19.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a long heritage of maybe violent
history attached to it.

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:22.315 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So maybe
let's call it Creation, then.

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:23.983 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They simply want us
to look at the facts,

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and learn to understand 
the truth.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:30.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The Pleiadians said there are no
earth religions that are valid,

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:35.286 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that they are all dogmas
created by men to create men.

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:36.579 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
We don't need an intercessor,

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:39.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we shouldn't be taking anybody
else's ideas about religion.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It's all internal.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.252 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Everybody has his own contact
with the Creation.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.129 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Because in various cultures

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:49.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from the Middle East, South and
Central Americas and India, etc,

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:53.179 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
all of the gods of the past
were extraterrestrial humans.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:56.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Many of them were the
forefathers of the Plejaren.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Because their ancestors
set in motion these religions,

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:02.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which have led to many
of the problems we face today,

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.440 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
they want to help us.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But this time they
must do so without

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:10.029 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
directly interfering with us
because that would only lead to

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:13.449 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
them being worshiped again or
to their being attacked.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:16.202 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
When we think about God and
religion and the universe,

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:20.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we might want to consider that
we live on a little ball.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Actually, if we put it
in perspective, we live on

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:26.712 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a piece of cosmic lint, somehow
magically suspended in space --

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:29.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
perfect operation,
everything's going on.

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:34.053 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In religion we want to say that
God is responsible for that,

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:37.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and that we should also fear
God, or maybe we won't be

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
sitting on a cloud after we die,
we'll be dipped eternally

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:43.270 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in molten lava.
Not exactly a positive image.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:47.233 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And so on one hand we have the
spiritual teachings from Meier,

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:50.569 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the various religions
of our world. To understand the

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
difference between them, we
really have to look at both.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:59.078 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Then the human beings are no
longer in a position to think

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:02.289 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for themselves. They still
only think in the framework

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:07.128 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
proscribed by religions, sects,
philosophies and ideologies.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:18.013 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
But the human beings must

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.307 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
nurse their thoughts
from within themselves.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:22.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They have to learn their
thoughts and create

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:25.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the respective feelings,
and it is only then

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that they may detach 
themselves from that which

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the false teachings,
the erroneous teachings,

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:33.446 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which hammering 
fear into them, are bringing.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt;Here is a 
memento for me

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:44.457 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that someone nailed
on the door of the house.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:47.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
"It's enough, you dog,
you will be put down."

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:49.336 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Shortly after this note was
nailed on the door,

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:51.505 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a couple of days later,
it came to a head,

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:54.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and someone shot at me
once again and tried to kill me.

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:02.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And here is the place that
I was once supposed

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:06.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to come for a contact. Jacobus
was with me and two other men.

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.563 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
In the hours 
of the night,

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
someone shot at me
from down there.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.701 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I dreamed about it days before,
and had hung a metal plate

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:23.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in front of my chest
under my jacket,

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:26.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and on top of it
a memorandum book.

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:33.172 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And the bullet went through the
book and into the metal plate,

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:36.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and so my life was saved through
a dream that I had had before.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:39.595 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Because I have dreams again and
again, which show me things

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:42.097 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
that will happen in the future.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:51.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Can we all have such dreams?
&gt;&gt;Actually, everybody can

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:53.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
have such dreams if they
concentrate on them,

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and begin to steer their dreams,
and when they enable themselves

01:16:56.654 --> 01:17:00.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to somehow have visions
through dreams, dream visions,

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:03.536 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
prophetic dreams,
and so on and so forth.

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:15.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But that naturally requires
that the human concentrates,

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:17.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and uses his consciousness
to really make use of

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:21.178 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the energies and forces
which arise from it.

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:32.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Meier is not a pacifist. His
position is that self-defense

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:36.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is a basic human right, but that
weapons may only be used

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:40.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
if there's absolutely no other
way to defend one's own life

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:43.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or someone else's.
Even then, killing someone

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:46.579 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in self-defense should be
the absolute last resort.

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:49.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, going to war
or attacking other persons

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who do not directly threaten
one's self or others

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:57.006 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is not self-defense,
but a punishable crime.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.095 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
My weapons.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:06.056 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is my son's army pistol.
In Switzerland,

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:09.018 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Swiss soldiers
have their weapons at home.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.774 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Small caliber rifles,

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:19.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
two submachine guns,
two Kalashnikovs,

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:24.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and here is my revolver,
22 millimeter,

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:28.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and this is my second army
weapon, 9mm, 44 magnum,

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:33.417 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
bulldog revolver.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:35.336 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Why do you have all these
weapons?

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:37.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;I actually carried these
weapons earlier

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:40.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
during night watches and for the
job I had, for security,

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.551 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
transporting money,
and so forth.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:51.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Wouldn't you say it's a bit
aggressive or even provocative

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:54.313 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to hoard so many revolvers,
so many weapons?

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:58.984 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;No.
And this is my army pistol.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:01.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;What do the Plejaren say
about self-defense?

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:05.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And what about carrying weapons?
&gt;&gt;Self defense with weapons

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is actually only appropriate
if it effectively involves

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.996 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
defending a life.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.380 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;I see myself quite simply
as a teacher, as a herald,

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.549 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
even if they say that
I am a prophet.

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:26.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I simply see myself
as a quite normal human being.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Silent Revolution of Truth
actually is exactly

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.602 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the appropriate name
for what we are doing here.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
First of all it has to do with
self-responsibility,

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:39.483 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and that the human being
learns to go back to his roots,

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:43.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
without any compulsion,
and learn to be a human being.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:48.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The Plejaren say that they know,
not believe, but know,

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:51.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that there is such a thing
called the "human spirit".

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.581 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And there is a soul, but the
soul is a transitory element of

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:59.044 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a human being, kind of located
in the solar plexus, primarily,

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.296 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and it dissolves after death.

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:02.631 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Let's get back to
the human spirit.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:05.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That is the
eternal and immortal part of us.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:07.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
There's a
physical location for it,

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:09.722 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which is deep within the brain.
They claim that they know this

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:14.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to be true, and that
they also know that people

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
live numerous lives,
we're talking about

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:19.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
millions and millions of
different incarnations.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:23.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So in terms or reincarnation, we
might have a slogan that says,

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:25.738 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
"Don't worry about dying.
You'll live through it."

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:28.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In living through it, it means
that you actually are born again

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:31.243 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
into a different personality.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:35.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They know, therefore,
scientifically, that the human

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:39.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
spirit comes into the fetus at
the third week, the 21st day.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:43.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Therefore, they allow abortion
up until that point, but

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:45.507 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they don't allow it afterwards,
because they consider that

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:46.800 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
that would be murder.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.054 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So in our world, because we
don't know for certainty

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:52.389 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that there is a human spirit,
we don't know

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:55.642 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that there is reincarnation, we
either believe it or we don't,

01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:57.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we are polarized.
Those people who believe

01:20:57.811 --> 01:21:01.315 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that abortion is OK under any
conditions, and those who

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:04.193 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
believe that it isn't under any
conditions.

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:06.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Both sides are actually right,
and both sides are wrong.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:10.616 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Once we know, scientifically,
that there is a human spirit,

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:14.119 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and when it comes and attaches
to the embryo, we would resolve

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:18.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that polarization issue, just as
the Plejaren apparently have.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:25.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This here
is the tree of life, and its

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
branches are pointing upwards.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:30.260 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But what's declared to be
the peace symbol these days

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is the rune designating death.

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:36.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In other words,
people use the sign upside down,

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:39.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it doesn't mean peace,
it means death.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:42.147 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The apostles of peace
around the world

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.274 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
even paint it on their faces.

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:51.115 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This sign, the death sign,
has exactly the opposite effect

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:54.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of "to live",
of everything growing upwards.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.166 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Everything must flourish,
everything must grow.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.548 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
According to these teachings,
actually, the core problem is

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:11.677 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
overpopulation.
Because we are pressing against

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:15.347 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
our environment and each other,
causing enormous problems.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Our environmental problems are
largely due to

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:22.062 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the abuse, degradation and
overuse of the environment.

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:25.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Meier has been
writing about this since 1951.

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:26.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Global warming, which is

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:28.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a natural occurrence
to a certain degree,

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:32.531 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is now 3 to 1, 75 percent
human-caused,

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
largely due to overpopulation.

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.702 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It also produces
another problem, which is

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:39.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
illegal immigration.
When people in a country

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:42.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
have not attained economic and
educational standards,

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
productivity... at a certain
level that they crave,

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:48.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they will migrate
into another country where

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.382 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that accomplishment is present,
and they want to

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.050 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
take advantage
of that system.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.385 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It doesn't mean they're
bad people. It's

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
an impersonal thing.
It simply means that

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:58.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
they are not prepared
to solve their own problems.

01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:01.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They will therefore
start to degrade the very system

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:03.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that they come in
and take advantage of.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.731 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They don't help
their home country,

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:08.734 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so they actually betray their
responsibility of

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:11.528 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
bringing themselves and their
countrymen, their land,

01:23:11.528 --> 01:23:15.073 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
up to the level
that they would aspire to have.

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.993 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Illegal immigration sets up
strife, famine, wars --

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:20.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
civil unrest.
So when the Plejaren said,

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:23.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
years and years ago, decades
ago, that the United States

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:27.252 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
will suffer two civil wars,
one following the other,

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:30.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I laughed at it, until I start
to look now at the problems

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:33.217 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that we are recognizing
in our own country

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:34.760 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
due to illegal immigration.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;What's the solution to
overpopulation, Michael?

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:39.264 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;According to
the information of this case,

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
a cessation of births.

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:43.227 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Very simply, there is a
staggered means of

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:46.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
introducing births into a
society once it has attained a

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:49.107 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
reasonable level of population.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;What would you say about the
relationship between

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:58.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a man and a woman?
How does it really work?

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:02.079 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;An interpersonal relationship
between a man and a woman

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.456 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
must naturally be defined
according to what the

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:08.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
personal circumstances are
with the two people.

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:16.009 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
An interpersonal relationship
can simply be

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:19.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
from human to human in which
everything becomes valid,

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:20.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as we have often already said,

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:25.727 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
such as love, empathy,
freedom, peace and harmony.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.646 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Then there are also

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:30.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
interpersonal relationships
which reach very much further,

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:32.651 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and indeed to the extent that
a friendship comes about

01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:36.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
whereby all these values
become very much deeper.

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:39.032 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And then there is
a further possibility

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:41.702 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
where the two build up a
life-long union together,

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:46.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where man and woman live
together as life partners.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:53.088 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's all the same if they are
married according to legal

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:57.175 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
values, as the authorities
require it here on earth, or if

01:24:57.175 --> 01:25:00.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a free life partnership exists
which, luckily, is feasible

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:04.182 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and allowed in our latitudes, or
in the western world.

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Do you have something to say
to that, Michael?

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:22.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;About man and woman living
together?

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:24.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Yeah.
I am not an expert in that area.

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:31.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
[laughter]

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Billy, how do you see the rest
of the world coming to terms

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:36.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
with your teachings?
How can that come about?

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:39.634 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;When we are talking about the
rest of the world beyond our

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:43.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Center here, and beyond our FIGU
community, it can only come

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:47.559 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
about the same way that a small
snowball rolling down a hill

01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:51.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
will accumulate more and more
snow and grow bigger and bigger.

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:59.071 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That means that the people who
come to us and understand what

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:02.532 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we teach, and also make the
effort themselves to transform

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:04.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
what they learn into reality,...

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:12.000 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
...will further carry it to
their neighbors, acquaintances,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and friends, and so forth.
And, in this way,

01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:17.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
everything slowly spreads out.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:25.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Perhaps the most startling
of what I call the

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.308 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
prophetically accurate
information in the Meier case

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:31.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
pertains to Meier's astronomical
information about numerous

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:36.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
planets, but especially Jupiter,
its rings, its moons.

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:37.984 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Meier specifically said

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:41.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that Io is the most volcanically
active body in the solar system.

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:45.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He published that 5 months
before we discovered it.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:48.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
More than a year after he
published the information on a

01:26:48.995 --> 01:26:52.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
ring of Jupiter being composed
of ionized sulphur particles,

01:26:52.624 --> 01:26:58.547 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Science Magazine published that
information in January of 1980.

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:02.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Most impressively, when I sent
Meier's information about Io

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
being the most volcanically
active body in the solar system,

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:09.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as published by Meier 5 months
before the probe got there,

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.143 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Professor Joseph Veverka,

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the head of the astronomy
department at Cornell University

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:16.022 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
said the following to me,
and I quote --

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:20.318 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"If he (Meier) said that,
three to six months before,

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:23.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
then all I can say is that
he was right."

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:27.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In 1958, he publishes a letter
in which he foretells

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:30.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
two US wars with Iraq,
the second one he claims

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:32.330 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
will lead to
an unbelievable disaster.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:35.083 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He names AIDS as a coming
epidemic.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:38.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He names crystal meth as a
coming drug epidemic.

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:40.547 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
He specifically foretells

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:43.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
computers, credit cards, the
dates of various events

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.719 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
such as moon landings
and rocket launches,

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:48.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
years and decades
before these things occur.

01:27:48.722 --> 01:27:52.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;So what do people do about it?
&gt;&gt;The problem is that we,

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:55.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the people of earth,
do not learn

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:56.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
from prophecies and predictions.

01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:58.773 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We do not seem to have
the common sense,

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:02.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
let alone the wisdom,
to take the warning about things

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:03.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that are going to occur.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:06.573 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You see, prophecies and
predictions really are

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:10.035 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the manifestation of the law of
cause and effect.

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:12.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That means that that which you
send out will come back.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:19.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;What about the future,
Michael?

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:22.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;We're being told that we are
leaving an age,

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:26.051 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
an age of beliefs, and we're
entering an age of knowledge.

01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:28.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;It's a difficult transition,
this move into the future.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's going to be uncomfortable
because we've relied so much

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:34.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
on belief,
and not enough on knowledge.

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:35.727 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
If you get on an airplane,
you're gonna fly somewhere,

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:37.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
do you want to know that the
pilot

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:40.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
believes he can fly the plane,
or that he knows how to fly?

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.692 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We've been given
a weather report.

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:45.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Prophecies and predictions,
the difference between the two--

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:47.447 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Prophecies are the likely
outcomes of

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
events that are in motion,
the effects of causes.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If we don't rectify them,
we get this negative outcome

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:56.081 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
called a Third World War.

01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:58.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Predictions are things that the
Plejaren claim are set in stone,

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:01.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and they're usually relate
to more cosmic events.

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:04.923 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A Planetary body, a meteor 
coming through, a volcanic 

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:07.259 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
eruption or an earthquake that 
has nothing to do with 

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:08.969 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
human activity.

01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:11.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In terms of the things that we
are most concerned about,

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:15.433 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a third world war or terrorism.
Let's take the third world war.

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:17.269 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's not written in stone.
It's just that it's

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:20.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a high probability unless
we as human beings go right back

01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:24.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to this core principle and take
responsibility for our thoughts.

01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:27.153 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Do we want to keep seeing
the world in this way?

01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:29.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Do we want to empower people
who are going to lead us

01:29:29.614 --> 01:29:33.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in these dead-end directions
that only lead to destruction?

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Here's an unfortunate truth --

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:39.040 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Our country, the United States,
in the past 60-some years

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
has launched over 200 unprovoked
attacks against other people.

01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:45.714 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The law of cause and effect
tells us that, sooner or later,

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:50.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that pendulum comes back, and
comes back as a wrecking ball.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:55.056 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The war against terrorism
will not be won militarily.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Not through aggression
against people who had

01:29:57.767 --> 01:29:58.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
nothing to do with it.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:01.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Not through recruiting
more terrorists by

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:02.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
bombing innocent people.

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:04.608 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The way they recommend,
and they say it's an

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:08.528 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
age-, age-, age-old solution,
that all countries on earth

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:12.741 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
must contribute equally
to a true peace combat force.

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:15.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This is a force of armed
soldiers under

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:18.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
true international law,
that are sent in to put down

01:30:18.622 --> 01:30:23.001 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
terrorism, insurrections, wars
and criminality and aggression.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:26.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We could put down this type of
terrorism in a very short order.

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:29.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Do we have the will, and do we
have the wisdom to do that?

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:33.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
True leadership from here on
only comes from the bottom up.

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's not going to come to us
from the top down.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We are in a time
of false leadership.

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:42.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If we recognize a person of
integrity who stands for truth

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:45.440 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and is willing to buck the tide
of all the pressures --

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
political, religious and
everything else -- yes,

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:49.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we should support that person.

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:52.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As it's said,
It will be later on in time,

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.740 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
the true mothers
of the millennium

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
who will
bring peace and harmony.

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:58.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The women will come into
their true feminine power,

01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:01.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
not the imitation of male power.

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:03.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They will be in balance with
that, and they will bring

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:07.504 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that element strongly forward
so that peace will come.

01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:11.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As we go into this new time,
structures are dissolving

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and they're falling apart.

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:14.719 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But that sounds like doom and
gloom. It isn't really.

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:17.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's that
the seeds of a new time,

01:31:17.097 --> 01:31:19.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the seeds of new understanding
and harmony and peace are

01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:22.560 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
developing in the fertilizer,
if you will, of these

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
very, very
difficult times that we're in.

01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:31.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When I
ponder the negative and positive

01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:33.697 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
which have occurred in my life,

01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:36.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I have to say that
I realize it is necessary that

01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:41.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the human being experiences both
-- the bad as well as the good.

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:48.503 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I think
if we embrace the idea that

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:52.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
we are going to courageously
move forward to discover

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:56.636 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
how we can bring about
the kind of harmony that all,

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:58.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
every human being craves
within themselves,

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:01.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we will awaken to this
age of knowledge and

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:03.268 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to all of the parts of it
that would come with it.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:07.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This isn't just about ETs and
UFOs, as fascinating as that is.

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:10.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's about us and
our future survival.

01:32:10.316 --> 01:32:13.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The more I read, the more I felt
that I had a personal mission --

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:16.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to help prove a lot of these
prophecies wrong.

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.616 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
By instilling some hope
and directing people to

01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:21.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
think for themselves
so that we can leave a world

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:23.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
for our children
that's going to be

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a lot better than
the one we're living in now.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.462 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;If this all turns out to be a
hoax, what would you say?

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:32.297 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Well, for me,
I only have one question,

01:32:32.297 --> 01:32:35.216 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and that would be,
"How did he do it?"

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.135 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
