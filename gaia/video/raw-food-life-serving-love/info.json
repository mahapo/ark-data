{"fields":{"body":[{"value":"We are constantly searching for answers to our chronic health conditions, looking for ways in which to cope with our skyrocketing stress and anxiety levels, or seeking out ways in which to gain greater vitality, energy, and zest for life. The answer has been sitting there right in front of us. It’s the food we eat.\r\n\r\nNatalie Dowell McIntosh, with the support of her husband Stuart, has literally transformed her life from a world heavily reliant upon medication and riddled with stress and anxiety to a life free of medication, with boundless energy and clarity. How ? Simply by re-examining what they were eating and changing to a plant-based diet.\r\n\r\nStuart McIntosh of Raw Food for Life states, “We eat the same as our parents did. We create the same stressors in our lives. We tend to become replicas. What happens when you create the same environment and you have the same genes? You have the same outcome. But we do have the choice; it’s not just purely genetics and fate. We know that if we change the internal environment of our cells we can then start to expect a different outcome.”\r\n\r\nNatalie and Stuart McIntosh of Raw Food for Life have teamed up Dr. Michael Klaper, Dr. Malcolm Mackay, Former Vice-President of CitiBank Philip Wollen OAM, World Record-holding veteran athletes Janette and Alan Murray, and others, to bring you this new documentary which shares the stories of people who have experienced profound health benefits through dietary and lifestyle changes, including overcoming cancer, illness and depression.\r\n\r\nAustralians are increasingly living with lifestyle-related chronic diseases, health conditions, and health risks - with diet playing the largest role in the development of chronic illnesses. \r\nIn 2014/15 - $161.6 billion was spent on health care, equating to $6,846 per person in Australia. This is growing by $2.8% per year. Strong research suggests depression and dementia are affected by the quality or our diet throughout our life. \r\n\r\nFor more than 40 years, Dr. Michael Klaper has served as a physician, consultant, and educator to thousands of clients and patients around the world on their journey to reclaiming health and optimizing well-being. When he initially changed his approach to medicine he recognized, Lo and behold, the same wonderful changes began happening in my patients' bodies. They became leaner, their high blood pressures went down, their diabetes went away. It’s the food… it has been the food all along!\r\n\r\nDr. Malcolm Mackay is a General Practitioner with 30 years of experience in medical practice. He has a special interest in preventing and managing chronic disease with whole foods plant-based nutrition. Many patients have conditions that are being fueled by the food they eat, and are suffering or are taking powerful pharmaceuticals to overcome the effects of the food”.\r\nToday food is consumed more for pleasure than nutrition, but what if we can learn how to satisfy our pleasure receptors with nutrient-dense plant foods? The good news is that, We absolutely can!” says Natalie McIntosh. We show you how to easily replace even the strongest food addictions such as cheese and bread, with delicious health-giving alternatives.\"\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer\r\n- Please be advised that although we feel there are important messages in this film, we also acknowledge that there may be conflicting ideologies that challenge beliefs. We like to encourage our viewers to do their own diligent research to determine which is the right approach for them as we regard nutrition and health as being highly individualized and not a ‘one size fits all’ approach.\r\n\r\n- Additionally, the following footage contains graphic imagery that may be disturbing /upsetting to some viewers.","format":1}],"teaser":[{"value":"We are constantly searching for answers to our chronic health conditions, looking for ways in which to cope with our skyrocketing stress and anxiety levels, or seeking out ways in which to gain greater vitality, energy, and zest for life.
