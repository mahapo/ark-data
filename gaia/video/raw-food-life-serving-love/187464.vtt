00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2006, I attempted suicide
whilst I was on a high dosage

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of medication for what my doctor
diagnosed as major depressive

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:90%
It was my second attempt.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The first time, I
was only a teenager.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
After having depression
since childhood,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I was told I would most likely
need to remain on medication

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
This prospect only further
added to my depression

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
because deep down, I knew
I was only just existing.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I was numb inside, and sleep was
my constant escape in a world

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that I was unable
to fully experience.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been an easy journey.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it has been the
greatest challenge of my life.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But I can humbly say that
I transformed my death wish

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:90%
into a huge life wish.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I finally found health
and happiness within.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
My so-called chemical imbalance
in the brain no longer exists.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I lost 20 kilos
and no longer have

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
symptoms of depression, anxiety,
panic attacks, chronic fatigue,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:90%
high cholesterol, and anemia.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I am completely
medication-free because I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:90%
chose to do whatever it takes.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:90%
I changed my beliefs.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:90%
I changed my diet.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I began yoga and meditating.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:90%
I changed my life.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And with the support of a loving
husband and children and those

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that loved me, I followed my own
heart and what I innately knew,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
which was guiding me inwards
towards my interconnected

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:90%
relationship with nature itself.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:90%
No one could do it for me.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the only true
form of help is self-help.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Today, I live as though
each day is precious,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
with self-love and gratitude
for this experience

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and all that unfolds.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
The innate gratitude, peace,
health, and happiness I feel

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
humbles me to the core,
and my outer world now

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:90%
mirrors my new inner world.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Health was my motivation,
and the weight also

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
naturally took care of
itself as my body detoxified

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:90%
and came back into balance.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
No pills, no shake,
no diet food,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
no counting points
and calories--

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
just an abundance of
nature's living plant foods.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I no longer have any
cravings for food

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't add
more life to my body.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I still have delicious desserts,
treats, and even cheese,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
but they're all made
of fruits and nuts.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I've developed a new
loving relationship

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
with food that's nourishing
to me both physically

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:90%
and spiritually.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I no longer choose to put
food into my body that

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
comes from the energy of
cruelty, suffering, violence,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:90%
and death.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The food I choose
to put into my body

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
contains the Earth's
vital life force

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and nourishment, which then
transfers into my cells,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.139 align:middle line:90%
giving me more life.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.562 align:middle line:90%

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I was on the cardiovascular
anesthesia service,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and day after day, I was putting
people to sleep and watching

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
surgeons open their chest and
pull out-- there's yellow,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
greasy gobs of material that
was clogging up their arteries

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.593 align:middle line:90%
called atherosclerosis.

00:04:26.593 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was
watching a surgeon pull out

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:90%
of slithery yellow piece.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, my heavens.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:90%
That looks like chicken fat.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.495 align:middle line:84%
And a little voice
on my shoulder

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
said, there's a good reason
why it looks like chicken fat.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It is chicken fat and
cow fat and pig fat

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and the fat of every
other slow animal that

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
was walking past
this man's table

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
when he had a fork in his hand.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
my patient's diet

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
was playing a major role
in what was putting them

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:90%
on the operating table.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was very concerned
because I had a father who

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.860 align:middle line:90%
died of clogged arteries.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I had his genetics, and I
knew that I was probably

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
going to be laying
on that operating

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
table with that Stryker
saw going up my sternum.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
want that to happen.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
As I changed to a whole
food, plant-based diet,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
a 10 kilogram band of fat
around my waist melted away.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
My blood pressure had
been elevated at 150-90.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
That settled down
to 110 over 70.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.145 align:middle line:84%
My cholesterol
dropped 20 points,

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and I felt great waking up
in a nice, lean, light body

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
food was absolutely

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.610 align:middle line:90%
key in creating a healthy body.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, here I was as an
anesthesia resident literally

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:84%
putting people to
sleep all day, and I

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
started feeling like
a cog in the machine.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, next,
next, and no one was

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
talking to these
people about what

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
it was that was clogging
up their arteries.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't be complicit
in that any longer.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I
enjoyed anesthesia,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I knew I didn't want to spend
my time putting people to sleep.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go back to general
practice and help them wake up.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So I returned back to general
practice in suburban Vancouver.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And this time, I was
empowered because the patients

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
that I had originally seen day
after day in my office that

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
made me feel just
dreadful and impotent--

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the overweight fellow with high
blood pressure and diabetes

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and clogged arteries.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
what to tell them.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I would fiddle with
their insulin dosage

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and say, you ought to
lose some weight, Joe.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But I really didn't
know what to say.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, I knew what to say.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Stop running all that animal
fat and animal protein

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and processed foods
through your bloodstream,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and get on a whole
food, plant-based diet.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend nearby who
was an excellent vegan chef,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and I would send them to her
where she would give them

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:90%
cooking lessons.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, the
same wonderful changes

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:84%
began happening in
my patients' bodies.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:90%
They became leaner.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Their high blood
pressures went down.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Their diabetes went away.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And this was very startling for
me because in medical school,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I had learned that with
your diabetic patients,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:84%
once on insulin,
always on insulin.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.923 align:middle line:90%
No one gets off insulin.

00:07:16.923 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you treat someone
with high blood pressure,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.173 align:middle line:84%
they will take these pills
the rest of their life.

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:90%
This is lifetime medication.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was finding
not only could I

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
get these people off
their medication,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:90%
I had to get them off.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The patients with
high blood pressure

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and these powerful medications
that dilated their blood

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
vessels and slowed down their
heartbeat-- they'd stand up,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
their blood pressure would
drop, they would pass out,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and you have to get them
off the medications.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing with the
diabetic patients-- their blood

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:90%
sugars would drop.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop their
insulin, or they'll

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:90%
have hypoglycemic reactions.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first
time I told a patient

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.712 align:middle line:84%
to stop your blood
pressure medications,

00:07:53.712 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I thought there would
be a puff of smoke,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and the ghost of my
internal medicine professor

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:84%
would appear and say,
what did you say?

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Stop his high blood
pressure medication?

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.598 align:middle line:90%
Hand in your stethoscope.

00:08:03.598 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Take off your white coat.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer a doctor.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is--

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I realize that their
dogma that they had

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
have been teach me-- that
was where the untruth lie.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were blinded by
the pharmacological model

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
of Western medicine,
that the only treatment

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is genetic for these
unknown-cause diseases.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, the
cause isn't unknown.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the food.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.171 align:middle line:90%
It's what the people are eating.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I think my journey into
whole foods and my interest

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in nutrition in general time
from the time around 20 years

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
ago when my father was
diagnosed with terminal cancer,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't accept the
diagnosis that he had six

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:90%
months to live.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I started my own
research into nutrition

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and came across many,
many examples of people

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
who had helped themselves
and even cured themselves

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
from their ailments
through nutrition

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
alone, which, the
more I got into it,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
made perfect sense because
it's our immune system that

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
does the fighting,
and our immune system

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:84%
depends on nutrients
that we take in.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's fairly simple
to understand that.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:90%
I gave Dad a juicer.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I tried to impart some of
this enthusiasm to him.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he gave
it a go for a few weeks

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and told me that I
would have to accept

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the doctors knew
what they were talking about,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that there wasn't any hope,
and thanked me for my efforts,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:84%
but it was something
that I needed to accept.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I found
probably hardest to accept

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:84%
was that Dad had resigned
himself to dying,

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and I guess I was probably quite
bitter about that for quite

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
awhile because I knew that there
was options out there that he

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
wasn't willing to try,
through a belief system

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
alone that someone else
knew more about his destiny

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:90%
than he did.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was, for me,
very hard to accept.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost six months
to the day that Dad died,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and that left me
wanting to find out

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
more about this system of
building your immune system

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to fight disease that
so many people had got

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
such great responses from,
which just wasn't being taught

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:84%
or shared by our
medical professionals

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:90%
with their patients.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So as for my own medical story,
when I was around 28 years old,

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I was going to the
doctor to get X-rays

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
because I was suffering from
shoulder pain and back pain.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said to me, is
there arthritis in your family?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, my mom's
crippled with arthritis.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:84%
She can't get out of
her chair some days.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Her hands are curling up.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And she suffers great
pain and loss of mobility.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
unfortunately, the X-rays

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
are showing up down in your neck
area, right down your spine.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
You have exactly the
same as your mother.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's genetic, it
will get worse, and you know,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
when the pain gets too
much, you take this,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
you take that, you
get prescribed this,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and that's your lot in life.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was that when
Natalie and I became vegan,

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
we also started to research more
about nutrition and nutrients

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
together because we were
noticing differences.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
That led us to pick up a raw
diet, become predominantly raw,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and staunch whole foodists
because of what we were

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:90%
researching and finding out.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
What that did for me
was the inflammation

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:90%
that I was suffering went away.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't taking any
medications anymore.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I was prior to that-- pain
killers, anti-inflammatories.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I started on this
whole food diet,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, my
symptoms disappeared.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no doubt that
if I go and get an X-ray,

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
it's still showing
signs of arthritis.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not presuming for a
minute that it's cured it.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not suffering
from that arthritis

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:33.450 align:middle line:84%
because I have changed the
environment that my body is in.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And I am no longer
in an environment

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.854 align:middle line:90%
that is conducive to suffering.

00:13:39.854 --> 00:13:43.186 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:43.186 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2012, I discovered I
had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
It was stage four and had
gone through all my implants.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Natalie and Stuart were
already on a plant-based diet,

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and Natalie had said
to me, Mom, are you

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:90%
willing to do what it takes?

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So they came back from
Northern Queensland

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and lived with us while I went
through the medical treatment,

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:90%
which I felt--

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
my oncologist had
strongly recommended,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and I felt, OK, that's his
advice, and I took that advice.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I wanted to make

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:84%
sure my body was
well-nourished and able to cope

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:90%
with the toxins of that chemo.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And that worked out quite well--

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:90%
very well, actually.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
The nurses and the doctor always
remarked how well I looked,

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and I did feel well.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I've just never looked back, and
I do thank Stuart and Natalie

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.840 align:middle line:90%
for encouraging me.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I used to call my daughter the
Army Sergeant because she made

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:84%
sure I stayed on
track, and they gave me

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
a 100% support, as
did all my family

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:90%
because they were very worried.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And that love and
support from your family

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and your friends is so
much a part of healing.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had to change
the internal environment

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm 68 years old.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm off my medications,
and I'm healthier

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.216 align:middle line:90%
than I ever have been.

00:15:23.216 --> 00:15:26.548 align:middle line:90%

00:15:26.548 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> In today's modern world, it
seems health conscious people

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
are obsessed with
the issue of protein.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Oh, protein, protein-- it
makes you big and strong.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Get on a high-protein diet.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the thing
that really produces health.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And we find out that that
is not only not true,

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
but that advice is
actually harmful.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if you're
eating enough calories

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
based from whole plant foods,
whole grains, whole legumes,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:84%
lots of beans and peas
and chickpeas and lentils

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and quinoa and
barley and millet,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
you can not be
deficient in protein.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
If you consume 2,000 calories
of these whole plant foods,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:90%
there is no way to avoid--

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
getting 50, 60, 70 grams

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:90%
of high-grade plant protein.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole protein
deficiency idea is a myth,

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and everyone can relax on that.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But note that I
said whole foods.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're consuming
granola bars and energy

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
drinks and processed foods,
that's something else.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you're eating
a whole plant foods--

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
like they grew out
of the ground--

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:84%
you cannot be protein-deficient
in nutritionally adequate,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
calorically adequate
plant-based diet.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And after all, the biggest
animals on the planet--

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:84%
elephants, buffaloes,
giraffes, gorillas--

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
grow to thousands of
pounds of mammalian muscle

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
without ever eating the
cheeseburgers and pepperoni

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:90%
pizzas.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
The amino acids that make
protein are in the plants,

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's easy to get enough,
and that is not an issue.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But very importantly, the amino
acids, the protein in the nuts

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
and the beans and the
seeds and legumes--

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.380 align:middle line:84%
as your body digests them,
they enter the bloodstream

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:84%
very slowly because
it takes time

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:84%
for the fiber and the
plants to be broken down

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.920 align:middle line:90%
by your digestive enzymes.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:84%
But when people
eat animal flesh,

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
or they use these protein
powders in their smoothies,

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
and they bolt down 100
grams of whey protein

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
like the bodybuilders
do, that protein

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
leaps into the bloodstream,
and it has toxic effects

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And the organ that really gets
it the worst are the kidneys.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Protein is toxic to the kidneys.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
High-protein diet is definitely
toxic to the kidneys.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
As those amino acids,
those acidic substances

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
hit the filter membranes,
it damages them.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:84%
A good nephrologist in
the renal unit-- a patient

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
in impending renal failure--
the first thing they do

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
is put them on a
low-protein diet.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:84%
They know how toxic
protein is to the kidneys.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet we're told protein,
protein-- it's good for you.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And these people
following the paleo diet

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that think that oh, we
need meat every day,

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and our caveman ancestors-- all
they ate was meat every day,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
which is not true.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of the calories that
our paleo ancestors ate

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
were gathered by the women,
who spent all day pulling up

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
roots and tubers and
gathering nuts and acorns

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and berries and edible grasses.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
We were really
starchivores back then,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and then there's good
anthropological evidence

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:90%
that shows this.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.957 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that animal flesh
is required with every meal--

00:18:31.957 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:84%
these people are writing
themselves a ticket

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:90%
to the dialysis machine.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of other
health problems-- everything

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
from the uric acid loads
to the oxalate loads that

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:84%
are going to be coming from a
meat-based diet, which we see

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
on a constant level if
the doctor takes the time

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to look for it.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
The saturated fats
in animal products

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:84%
clog up the insulin
receptors, and people

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:84%
who eat high-meat diets
are setting themselves up

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:84%
for a plague of diabetes as
well as autoimmune diseases.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
After all, you're eating
the flesh of another animal.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And as fragments of the
cow's tendon and muscle

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and joint tissue
from the chicken

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of this as
we gnaw on our bones

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and eat the muscle gets
into our bloodstream--

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
now, you've got proteins
from another animal floating

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.650 align:middle line:90%
through your tissues.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, you'll make antibodies
against that muscle and tendon,

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and you have antibodies now
cruising your bloodstream

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
looking for muscle and
connective tissue and thyroid

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.570 align:middle line:84%
tissue that's in the
sausages to lock onto.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And they find it in your own
muscle and tendons and joints.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And this plague of autoimmune
diseases we're seeing,

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe, has its root in
animal-based diet as well.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the
operating room,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and we see the surgeon
open up the arteries

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and pull out this plaque of
atherosclerotic material,

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's sent to
the pathologist,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.625 align:middle line:84%
and he analyzes
it chemically, it

00:19:57.625 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, filled with this
molecule called cholesterol.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Cholesterol is not
an evil molecule.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The body uses it to make
our steroid hormones--

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
estrogen,
testosterone, cortisol.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:90%
They're made from cholesterol.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not an evil molecule.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But your liver makes all
the cholesterol you need.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.040 align:middle line:84%
When we eat the cholesterol
of other animals,

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
it starts building up to high
levels in the bloodstream.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And because it comes from animal
flesh, which is invariably

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
cooked, the cooking of the
meat oxidizes the cholesterol.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And oxidized cholesterol is
a disease-producing molecule.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We not only encounter
that oxidized cholesterol

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:84%
from the cooking of the
meat, but inevitably people

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
eating the Western diet
that has meat in it.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.678 align:middle line:84%
They're also consuming
other oxidizing agents.

00:20:48.678 --> 00:20:50.220 align:middle line:84%
They're eating French
fries that have

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:90%
been fried in vegetable oil.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:90%
That's an oxidizing agent.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They're drinking soft drinks
with sugar and phosphoric acid

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:90%
along with their burger.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:90%
There's more oxidizing agents.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things
oxidize the cholesterol

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that they're eating in the
burger or in the chicken breast

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's this
oxidized cholesterol

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that burrows into the
wall of the artery,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
then it summons in inflammatory
cells that create free radicals

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
as they try to gobble
up these particles

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:90%
of oxidized cholesterol.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And the inflammatory
reaction that's

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
produced in the artery walls
from this oxidized cholesterol

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:84%
is what sets off
the production of

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:90%
these atherosclerotic plaques.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
The artery clogs up from
these plaques not just

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:84%
because the cholesterol
level is high,

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
but these are inflammatory
lesions that an animal-based

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:84%
diet with the oxidized
cholesterol that it produces,

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:90%
inevitably produces--

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:84%
well, you can see this
whole chain of events

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
is set off from eating the
cooked flesh of other animals.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's another
reason that we should

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
be eating a plant-based
diet because guess what?

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Plants don't make cholesterol.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat a whole
food, plant-based diet,

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
your liver will produce all
the cholesterol that you need.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It'll settle down
to normal levels.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And very importantly, it won't
be that oxidized cholesterol

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that is so damaging
to our artery walls

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and leads us down that dismal
pathway to heart attacks

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and strokes.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When we take a look at
our ancient diet, you know,

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
some people put
forward a paleo diet.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Paleo is such a small fraction
of our evolutionary history

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
that, how can we build the whole
of modern civilization's diet

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
on a fraction of our
7-million-year evolutionary

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:90%
history?

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make sense.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we've only had fire to
cook our food for around 2

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 million years,
if we've only had tools

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:84%
to chase down and kill animals
and eat meat for 2 and 1/2

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
million years, what
did we do prior to that

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
in our 7-million-year
evolutionary history?

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
One thing that hasn't
changed from then till now

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.130 align:middle line:90%
is the opposable thumb.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not
something we learned.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.620 align:middle line:90%
We learned to light a fire.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:90%
We learned to make a tool.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
This is an instrument that
nature has provided us with.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And with that, that
was for picking leaves,

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:84%
for picking fruit, for
gathering vegetables.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:84%
That is the instrument that
nature provided us with,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and it provided us
with the food that we

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
needed to sustain our bodies,
our immune system, and that

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:90%
was raw food.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Raw fruits and
vegetables gave us

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.693 align:middle line:84%
everything we needed
to survive and thrive.

00:23:41.693 --> 00:23:45.637 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:45.637 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> My daughter Olivia was
diagnosed with a spinal tumor

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and a brain tumor
in 2011, in July,

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and we took a long time
to get to that diagnosis.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, it was some sort
of earth-shattering news

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:90%
that it was cancer.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:84%
She had chemotherapy
for nine months,

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
which, unfortunately, it
didn't shrink the tumors.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we weren't really
offered any other option.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.533 align:middle line:84%
And we stopped early because
they agreed there was--

00:24:22.533 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
you know, it wasn't working.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So with permission
from them, we stopped.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.915 align:middle line:84%
And we decided that watching and
waiting for it to grow wasn't--

00:24:30.915 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
it just wasn't
appropriate for us.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
We were told that that's
what we should do,

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and it just wasn't an option.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So I put my research
hat on and started

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:90%
looking at alternatives.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we sort of
came across the diet path.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I had been reading about
a full plant-based diet.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think the most amazing
part was that within a week,

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:90%
her behaviors changed.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Olivia, with the brain
tumor, it actually

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:84%
causes things like impulse
control, concentration issues,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, things like
that-- neurological things.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And within a week of going
to a full plant-based diet

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.190 align:middle line:84%
with green smoothies, it was
incredible the difference

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:90%
in her.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
We knew really early that
we were on the right path.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
We'd finally found the
path that we needed

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:90%
to travel to keep her well.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
We were on the plant-based
diet for about four months

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
when the next MRI scan was due
because we obviously needed

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:90%
to see if it was growing.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were sort of
expecting that it probably

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
would because once things grow,
they usually keep growing.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But we were ecstatic to find
that if it hadn't grown.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So the tumor was stable again,
which was a massive relief

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and just more validation that
we were doing the right thing.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We were on that path
that we needed to be on.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
We're two years on from going
to the plant-based diet,

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:90%
and she's incredible.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:84%
We've had subsequent
scans where there

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
was all lots of fluid around
the tumor, and that was gone,

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:84%
which, you know,
was huge for us.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:84%
We were-- we were
thrilled with that.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's stayed stable, as
far as there's been no growth.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're just--
we feel like we're

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:90%
doing all the right things.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And she's great.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:90%
She's coping with so much more.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.910 align:middle line:90%
She's-- her hair is shiny.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Her skin is clear.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, it really has been
an amazing transformation.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.877 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
have people think

00:26:37.877 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're a bit weird and
strange for what we're doing,

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's OK because we're
really comfortable with what

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:90%
we're doing.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to stick with it.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And my proudest mommy
moment, I think,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
was when one of her doctors made
a comment that chocolate was

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:84%
really good for energy,
and I rolled my eyes,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:84%
but we've actually corrected
him and very politely

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:84%
said that green smoothies
are good for energy.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And unless he's eating mummy's
raw chocolate that she makes,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.681 align:middle line:90%
then he's not being healthy.

00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:10.507 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:10.507 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The milk of a cow is designed
by nature to turn a 65-pound

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
calf into a 700-pound cow
as rapidly as possible.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Cow's milk is baby
calf growth fluid.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what the stuff is.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
that white liquid--

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.460 align:middle line:84%
the hormones, the lipids,
the sodium, the protein,

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:90%
the growth factors, IGF1--

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.390 align:middle line:84%
everything is in there
to blow that calf up

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
into a great big cow,
or it wouldn't be there.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And whether you pour it on
your cereal as a liquid,

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:84%
whether you churn it into
butter, whether you coagulate

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
it into yogurt,
whether you ferment it

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
into cheese, whether you
add sugar and freeze it

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
into ice cream, it's
baby calf growth fluid.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Cow's milk is the
lactation secretion

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:84%
of a large bovine mammal
that just had a baby.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to modern
dairying, she's

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
already pregnant
with her next calf.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So most of the milk
and cheese and ice

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
cream that you're
buying and consuming,

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're still
eating dairy products,

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:84%
is made from the milk drawn
off of large, pregnant bovines.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The estrogen content of this
milk is through the roof.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And studies clearly show that
when children drink milk,

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.710 align:middle line:84%
within 15 minutes,
their urine is

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:84%
pouring with estrone, estradiol,
estriol, pregnanediol.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.270 align:middle line:84%
These are potent
mammalian estrogens.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:84%
They're not the puny little
phytoestrogens in soy.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:84%
These are official
mammalian estrogens.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And researchers
are becoming very

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the
effects of this.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Get your mammograms, ladies.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Why do Western women get
all these breast lumps?

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:90%
That's not normal.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.648 align:middle line:90%
That's not natural.

00:29:06.648 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You go to rural China; you don't
see women with breast lumps.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.130 align:middle line:84%
You go to rural Vietnam;
you don't see women

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:90%
with breast lumps-- yet.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.540 align:middle line:84%
When the Western diet
metastasizes over there,

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.920 align:middle line:90%
you'll see it at that time.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But the human breast
is not supposed

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
to turn into these lumpy,
pre-malignant masses.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But again, could
it have something

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.740 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this huge
amount of mammalian estrogens

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that women are eating to protect
themselves against osteoporosis

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid they
won't get enough calcium?

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
That's another story, but truth
is that cow's milk does not

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:90%
prevent osteoporosis.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
That disease is not a
disease of calcium deficiency

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But under the guise of trying
to make their bones strong,

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:84%
the a tremendous amount
of estrogens are not only,

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe, driving the
development the breast lumps,

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:84%
but the uterus is a
hormone responsive muscle.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And when a woman
is pregnant, you

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
see what nine
months of estrogens

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.197 align:middle line:90%
does to the size of her uterus.

00:30:04.197 --> 00:30:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, if she's eating milk and
cheese and ice cream and yogurt

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:84%
every day, those estrogens
have an effect on the uterus,

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and the muscle of the wall of
the uterus starts getting thick

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and turns into these
fibroid tumors that

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
make the woman
bleed extra heavy,

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.298 align:middle line:84%
and so she becomes anemic
till the surgeon says,

00:30:20.298 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:84%
you need to lay down
on the operating table

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and let me open your abdomen
take out your uterus.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll get rid of those fibroids.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.350 align:middle line:84%
She says, how did I get
these fibroids, doctor?

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.150 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.340 align:middle line:90%
They just seem to happen.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't do hysterectomies
for fibroids in rural China--

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:84%
But again, the estrogens
in dairy products

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:84%
are suspected of being a major
culprit in this condition.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Men are not spared
the ravages of

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:84%
this high-fat,
estrogen-laden substance that

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:90%
is in dairy products.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
These fellas sitting
on the couch look down,

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and as they're shoveling
in their cheese

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.060 align:middle line:84%
nachos and deep
dish pizzas, they

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.140 align:middle line:84%
look down and see their
breasts are getting big.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Hey, where did I
get these man boobs?

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Fella, you're eating
cow estrogens.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:84%
On a daily basis, the
male breast responds.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:84%
In every 100th case of breast
cancer in the Western society,

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.190 align:middle line:90%
it is in a man.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't always
used to be like that.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
The prostate gland gets
unstable under the influence

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:90%
of these estrogens.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And because cow's milk is
filled with growth factors

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
like insulin-like
growth factor 1,

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
growth-promoting substance

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:90%
known to biology.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a baby calf,
you want lots of IGF1.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a man with a
little prostate cancer growing

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:84%
in your prostate, that's like
throwing gasoline on a fire.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The protein in cow's milk is
not gentle in the human body,

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.230 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:84%
We are now seeing that
the lactalbumin and casein

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
turn on genes in the
oil glands of the skin

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and makes the oil glands produce
a very acidic skin oil that

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:84%
clogs up the pores in the skin
and promotes acne in children.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you do a search
on dairy and acne,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:84%
you will see this
solid connection

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
between children who
consume dairy products

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and the acne they develop.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And this protein stimulates
inflammatory reactions

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:84%
in the body, and two organs
that really suffer badly

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:90%
are the lungs and the joints.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
In Sweden, Dr. Olof Lindahl
had 70 asthmatic patients,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
some serious asthmatics
taking albuterol inhalers

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:90%
and taking Prednisone tablets.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
He put them on a whole food,
plant-based vegan diet,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and within a year, 92% of them
were off their medication.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:84%
That was the end
of their asthma.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I find it in
my general practice

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.188 align:middle line:84%
when the kids come
in with wheezing,

00:32:51.188 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're consuming
dairy products,

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.490 align:middle line:84%
to tell them stop the
dairy, and in most cases,

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:90%
that's the end of their asthma.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that the animal
protein, the dairy protein

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:84%
seems to stimulate antibodies
that can lodge in the joints

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and set off an
inflammatory joint disease.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And in Norway, Dr.
Jens Kjeldsen-Kragh

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.000 align:middle line:84%
took a number of patients
with rheumatoid arthritis,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.800 align:middle line:84%
did a brief
seven-day water fast,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and put them on a whole
food, plant-based vegan diet.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And the clearing of their joint
pain was absolutely remarkable.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:27.635 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to see that
cow's milk is for baby calves.

00:33:27.635 --> 00:33:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And I tell my patients--
look in the mirror.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you have big ears
and a tail and whiskers?

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Are you a baby calf?

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:90%
If you are, cool.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy your milk and cheese
and ice cream and yogurt.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:84%
If not, realize that we have no
more need for the milk of a cow

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:84%
than we do the milk of a
giraffe or the milk of a horse.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Would you pour horse
milk on your cereal?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Would you pour rat
milk in your cereal?

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Why do we think that cow
milk, that bovine milk

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.810 align:middle line:90%
is something beneficial for us?

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And more and more of my patients
who stop the dairy products

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.860 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing such great
benefits to their health

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes one of the
first things I recommend

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:90%
they pull out of their diet.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
And I predictably see
benefits in their health

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and the fewer number
of prescriptions

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:90%
I have to write for them.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's time
to really reconsider

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.219 align:middle line:84%
the role of dairy products
in the human diet.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We also tend to use the
television as our sole source

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:84%
of health and
nutritional information.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Remembering that that
information is provided

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
by the companies
selling the products,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and the thing that
drives television

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:90%
is advertisement dollars.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:90%
Take dairy, for instance.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:84%
Before the advent
of television, dairy

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:52.600 align:middle line:84%
wasn't consumed by us for a
need to increase our calcium.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Dairy was merely a product
that was available to us

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that we used in
most of our recipes

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.610 align:middle line:90%
and in our day-to-day lives.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Then came the
television commercials

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that told us we need to consume
dairy for our daily calcium

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:90%
intake.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The question is, then, if we
have only been farming animals

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.660 align:middle line:84%
for around 12,000 years, what
did we do for our calcium

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:84%
intake for the millions of
years of our human evolution?

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
What did we do for our
daily calcium intake

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
before we had cows to
milk and televisions

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:90%
to tell us that we needed it?

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So if milk is a perfect,
natural source of calcium,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
why are a lot of companies
now adding calcium to milk?

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when we ingest
milk or dairy products,

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
it causes our body to become
acidic, and as a buffer

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:58.850 align:middle line:84%
to restore the pH
back in our bodies,

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.790 align:middle line:84%
our bodies draw
calcium carbonate

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:90%
to restore the equilibrium.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And the only place we can
draw calcium carbonate from

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:90%
is our bones.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So in actual fact, the
consumption of dairy products

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:84%
is leaching calcium
from our bones.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is now showing
us that the countries who

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:84%
consume the most dairy
are suffering the highest

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:90%
rates of osteoporosis.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So if it was true that the
more dairy we consumed,

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the less osteoporosis
we would get,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
we would see the
opposite figures.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:90%
But we're not.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So if we could ask ourself,
if we didn't have television

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to tell us that we
needed to drink milk,

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:84%
what would we use to
determine whether we

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.210 align:middle line:90%
should be drinking milk or not?

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, we would
use our own common sense.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So as human beings, once we
have weaned off our own mother's

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:84%
milk and begun solid
food, we actually

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:84%
lose the enzyme in our gut
that allows us to break down

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.510 align:middle line:90%
casein, the protein in milk.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So from that point onwards,
we have no more requirement

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
for our mother's milk for
the rest of our lives.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't then go looking
to include in our diet

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.450 align:middle line:90%
the milk from another animal.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, naturally, we
wouldn't go looking for it

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.260 align:middle line:84%
at all until we turn
on the television,

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and a company tells
you that you need

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:84%
to take the milk of a cow
for the rest of your life.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So we should also
use our common sense

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:84%
when people use the
argument of time

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to justify us continuing
to do things that we've

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:90%
done for a long length of time.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.880 align:middle line:84%
People say that we've
eaten meat and drank dairy

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.840 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But the same is true of
smoking tobacco and turning

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.020 align:middle line:90%
poppy flowers into opium.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:25.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, doing something that is
harmful to our health for such

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:30.260 align:middle line:84%
a long period of time
unfortunately just shows us

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.557 align:middle line:90%
that we are very slow learners.

00:38:33.557 --> 00:38:37.050 align:middle line:90%

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When I discovered the
writing of Nathan Pritikin,

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I decided that I needed to fill
in the gaps in my nutrition

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.510 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So I took a conventional
course in Nutrition

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and completed a Graduate
Diploma in Human Nutrition

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:90%
from Deakin University.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
It was not until about
2010 that I connected

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.020 align:middle line:84%
to the online community
of medical practitioners

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and scientists in
the USA that I really

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:84%
began to fully understand the
power of nutrition to treat

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and reverse diseases.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I think we all agree
that people need

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.290 align:middle line:84%
to take some personal
responsibility

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:90%
for their health.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Part of my role as a
medical practitioner

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:84%
is to provide people
with information

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to empower them to make
better health choices.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Although I see patients
who have sought me

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:39.290 align:middle line:84%
out as a vegan doctor
or to help them to treat

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:42.590 align:middle line:84%
their disease with a whole
foods, plant-based diet,

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I see many patients who
just come and see me

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.270 align:middle line:84%
as an ordinary
general practitioner.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Many of these patients
have conditions

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that are being fueled by the
food they eat and are suffering

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.690 align:middle line:84%
or are taking powerful
pharmaceuticals

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to try and overcome
the effect of the food.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Whole plant foods
contain a diverse array

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of phytonutrients, substances
that are unique to plants.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:11.600 align:middle line:84%
This includes antioxidants,
anti-inflammatory substances,

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:84%
cancer-fighting substances,
and these substances

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
can have a broader and more
profound effect on health

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.120 align:middle line:90%
than pharmaceuticals.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.910 align:middle line:84%
While modern medicine
is very good at treating

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:27.520 align:middle line:84%
acute medical conditions such
as pneumonia, broken legs, et

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.470 align:middle line:84%
cetera, it's seriously
flawed when it comes

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.810 align:middle line:90%
to treating chronic diseases.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Most of these diseases are
largely caused by lifestyle,

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't
take away the cause

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and treat the cause
of the condition,

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.450 align:middle line:84%
then all we're really doing
with the pharmaceuticals is

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:45.875 align:middle line:90%
applying a Band-aid solution.

00:40:45.875 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
If someone has
diabetes, you know,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.910 align:middle line:84%
one tablet to bring
their sugar down,

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:53.630 align:middle line:84%
another to bring their
cholesterol down, et cetera.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the person
continues to eat

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.860 align:middle line:84%
a diet rich in animal-derived
foods and processed food

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and devoid of whole
plant foods, which

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:90%
is the cause of the disease.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.300 align:middle line:84%
People are often fearful
of adopting a completely

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.430 align:middle line:84%
plant-based diet
because they're afraid

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:84%
of nutrient deficiencies,
particularly things

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.570 align:middle line:90%
like iron, protein, and calcium.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:84%
It seems that red meat has
taken ownership of iron,

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that dairy owns calcium, that
meat and dairy own protein,

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:28.130 align:middle line:90%
that fish owns omega-3 fats.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.510 align:middle line:84%
In reality, whole plant
foods are excellent sources

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:35.060 align:middle line:90%
of all of these nutrients.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's any
doubt that lifestyle medicine,

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:84%
particularly nutrition,
is the future of medicine,

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
particularly when it
comes to chronic diseases

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:84%
like heart disease, diabetes,
inflammatory diseases.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.180 align:middle line:84%
In Australia,
health practitioners

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and nutrition
experts seem to have

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.010 align:middle line:84%
been slow to catch on
to this change, which

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I believe is inevitable.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The only group that seems to
have really seen it coming

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is particular food
industry groups

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that are fighting back
against plant-based diets.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.440 align:middle line:84%
No longer are we in
the position where

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.930 align:middle line:84%
we have to wait for
the health experts

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to tell the doctors to
tell the patients what

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.330 align:middle line:90%
to do for better health.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.300 align:middle line:84%
We're now in a new
era where information

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is more democratized, where
the information on the health

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
benefits of a plant-based
diet will come up

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.390 align:middle line:84%
through grassroots
movements, and people

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:90%
will get to it that way.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So at this point, I
became fascinated with

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
the commonly-held medical
belief that genes controlled

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:84%
everything, and that's
the common held belief

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.720 align:middle line:90%
for the general public.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, this then led me
into my own study of what

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:56.320 align:middle line:90%
is now known as epigenetics--

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.720 align:middle line:84%
epigenetics meaning
control above the genes.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.700 align:middle line:84%
People that I've studied
like Dr. Bruce Lipton

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.450 align:middle line:84%
say that this is
completely untrue.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:12.540 align:middle line:84%
He taught in
universities, lectured

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.820 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of genes
controlling everything

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:90%
for 40-odd years.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lipton is quoted as
saying genes cause nothing.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.610 align:middle line:84%
They are no more than
blueprints for building blocks,

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and blueprints do not
have on and off switches.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he says that the
principle element for life

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.080 align:middle line:90%
are proteins.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The cells of your
body are made up

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:84%
of more than 150,000
proteins, and protein in Latin

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:90%
means primary particle.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very
basics of life is

00:43:55.530 --> 00:44:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that proteins can change
shape, and they do so

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
by responding to
external signals.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And these signals are
coming from the environment

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that they are placed
in, and they are

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.080 align:middle line:90%
called confirmational changes.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:84%
In short, you are just a
protein machine responding

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.910 align:middle line:90%
to environmental changes.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, around 40 years
ago, while Dr. Lipton

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.480 align:middle line:84%
was doing his studies
on stem cell research,

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.450 align:middle line:84%
he was cloning
stem cells, and he

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:84%
put one stem cell
in a Petri dish,

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and the cells split, replicate
every 10 to 12 hours.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And within a week, he has 50,000
stem cells in the Petri dish.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And remember that each
one of those cells

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.100 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely identical.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It is an exact replica
of the other cell.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:58.500 align:middle line:84%
He then, after a week,
split these 50,000 cells

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:84%
into three separate
Petri dishes,

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing
he did differently

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:08.580 align:middle line:84%
was change the chemistry
of the medium in which they

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:90%
were growing in.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So he changed the environment of
each one of those Petri dishes,

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and those identical cells
in dish A made skin cells,

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:28.930 align:middle line:84%
in dish B made bone cells,
and in dish C made fat cells.

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have
an identical cell,

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and each cell has a
DNA molecule in it.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, by changing
the environment,

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
the cell changed to
a different form.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, what that
experiment showed

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.630 align:middle line:84%
was that you may inherit
genes from your parents

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.930 align:middle line:84%
to have a likelihood
of developing

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.330 align:middle line:90%
if you do one thing--

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.200 align:middle line:90%
continue the same environment.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.380 align:middle line:84%
We eat the same as
our parents did.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.870 align:middle line:84%
We create the same
stresses in our lives.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:09.330 align:middle line:90%
We tend to become replicas.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you
create the same environment,

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.520 align:middle line:90%
and you have the same genes?

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.120 align:middle line:90%
You have the same outcome.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.270 align:middle line:90%
But we do have now the choice.

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It is not just purely
genetics and fate.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.435 align:middle line:84%
We know that if we
change the environment--

00:46:25.435 --> 00:46:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and the biggest environment
that our cells are sitting in

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.720 align:middle line:90%
is the internal environment--

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.880 align:middle line:84%
when we change that
environment, we

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
can then start to expect
a different outcome.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps if we take
that knowledge that we do

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:84%
have some control, that
we can take responsibility

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.980 align:middle line:84%
for our health,
perhaps we can start

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
looking at what we do when
we well intentionally pour

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.720 align:middle line:84%
millions of dollars into
cancer research that

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.200 align:middle line:84%
tends to focus on
finding a cure,

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.270 align:middle line:84%
when perhaps we
could spend a little

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:middle line:84%
more attention on the
environment that causes

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.930 align:middle line:84%
the cancer in the
first place and give

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the public a little bit more
knowledge on what they can do

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.100 align:middle line:84%
to save and help
themselves and give some

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.490 align:middle line:84%
of the responsibility
back to us the people

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:25.910 align:middle line:84%
instead of putting it all onto
the medical establishment.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we're pouring
trillions of dollars down this

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:33.590 align:middle line:84%
rat hole of disease that
no one is benefiting from.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:84%
We spend thousands of
dollars each time a person

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.330 align:middle line:84%
goes into a hospital,
the intensive care

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:90%
unit, the operating theater.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And they get them stable so
they can limp out and do what?

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Eat more fried chicken and
more pizzas and more burgers,

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:90%
and around and around it goes.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And no one is getting
healthier, that's for sure.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:59.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the same trunk of the
tree of disease, if you will,

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.830 align:middle line:84%
the animal-based diet that
people eat in the West that

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:05.690 align:middle line:90%
has all these evil fruits.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And all my colleagues
in medicine

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:12.260 align:middle line:84%
are looking through
a very narrow window.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And the endocrinologist
sees the diabetes,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and the internist sees
the high blood pressure,

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and the cardiovascular surgeon
sees the clogged arteries,

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and the gastroenterologist
sees the colitis,

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and the dermatologist
sees the psoriasis.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're each looking through
these separate little keyholes,

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and the truth is they're all
looking at the same condition.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It's how the body malfunctions
on fuel that it was not

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:39.740 align:middle line:90%
meant to run on.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I tell my patients, before
you go for the next test

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and try for the next
magic pill, stop.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Clean up your diet.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Stop the animal products.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Get on a whole food,
plant-based diet.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Take a walk every day,
and drink plenty of water.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Get out in the sunshine, laugh
a lot, and watch what happens.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Watch what the
calendar brings you.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Week after week,
month after month,

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.140 align:middle line:84%
the body starts righting itself,
and the high blood pressures

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
go down, and the arteries open
up, and the diabetes goes away,

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and people start
getting healthy again.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And with little luck, I'll
put myself out of business

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and be able to spend my
days cycling and working out

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:20.004 align:middle line:90%
in my garden.

00:49:20.004 --> 00:49:23.483 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:23.483 --> 00:49:28.950 align:middle line:90%


00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have been open
for about three years now.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.300 align:middle line:84%
I started this business because
I believe in organic foods.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I believe in plant-based.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe in healthy
food, and I believe

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.990 align:middle line:84%
in bringing the community
together and just

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:84%
getting people involved in
this wellness, conscious food

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.920 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I only offer meals and
drinks and products

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and I really believe in, and
I take for myself personally,

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and I would recommend them
to my friends and families.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's no compromise.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Organic, gluten-free, vegan,
plant-based, just whole foods--

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.190 align:middle line:84%
nothing overly-processed, no
chemicals or preservatives.

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It has been amazing,
actually, and I

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.950 align:middle line:84%
haven't done any marketing
or advertising and things

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.780 align:middle line:84%
like that, but
just word of mouth.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:29.240 align:middle line:84%
People have been really
responding to what we do.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.475 align:middle line:84%
We do this business
from our hearts.

00:50:31.475 --> 00:50:32.600 align:middle line:90%
You know, they can feel it.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:90%
As soon as they come in, they--

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.520 align:middle line:84%
some of them say something
like, she comes into the shop,

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and she feels like
she was getting a hug.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
that sort of feeling.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.054 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:46.054 --> 00:50:48.470 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So I had my own health
struggles myself,

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and that was one of the reasons
I wanted to open this place

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and share this place
with others who

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.590 align:middle line:84%
might be going through
that same thing

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.290 align:middle line:84%
but not have a place
that they're really

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.980 align:middle line:84%
comfortable going, or
even they just like,

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:10.910 align:middle line:84%
heard of this movement
or heard of this diet,

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.470 align:middle line:90%
they just wanted to try.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not every day,
not every meal--

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.110 align:middle line:84%
just wanted to try
what it's like to feel

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.320 align:middle line:84%
really connected with a
plant-based like nature

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and plant-based
food, whole foods,

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:26.430 align:middle line:84%
organic foods because
that's what it's all about.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, food is a really
important part of your health,

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.210 align:middle line:84%
but not just health
like physical health,

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.700 align:middle line:84%
but your mental health
and spiritual health.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so grateful that I have
this place that, you know,

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I could share this amazing,
amazing movement with people.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> From time to time
in my medical practice,

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I will encounter a person
consuming a vegan diet.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.790 align:middle line:90%
They consume no animal products.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But I look at them, and
they're certainly not healthy.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.910 align:middle line:84%
They're either pale
and underweight,

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
or they're overweight, or
they have high blood pressure,

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.478 align:middle line:90%
or their skin is all broken out.

00:52:07.478 --> 00:52:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
what's happening?

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been a vegan for
two years, three years.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't I lean and healthy?

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I've stopped eating
animal products.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask that
very important question

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.980 align:middle line:84%
that I believe every physician
should ask every patient--

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.900 align:middle line:90%
take me through your eating day.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.647 align:middle line:84%
From morning till night,
from the first time

00:52:26.647 --> 00:52:28.730 align:middle line:84%
you put anything in your
mouth till you go to bed,

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.850 align:middle line:84%
tell me exactly what
you eat all day.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And my unhealthy vegan
invariably reveals a litany

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:41.510 align:middle line:84%
of processed foods, of sugary
cereals, of energy drinks,

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:45.230 align:middle line:84%
of granola bars,
of chips, of dips

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:49.790 align:middle line:84%
filled with hydrogenated
oils, and vegan junk food.

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the computer
people say garbage in,

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.360 align:middle line:90%
garbage out.

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.340 align:middle line:84%
It's true in nutrition,
but here, it's

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.570 align:middle line:90%
garbage in, garbage in.

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.780 align:middle line:90%
The stuff stays in.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is for that
reason that if you're

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.950 align:middle line:84%
going to be a healthy
vegan, then you've

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:06.530 align:middle line:84%
got to really eat healthy
food, and I'm talking

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:10.160 align:middle line:90%
about whole plant-based foods.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.650 align:middle line:84%
My friend Dr. Hans Diehl
has a beautiful phrase.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, eat food as grown,
as was growing in the field.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:17.910 align:middle line:90%
If you like potatoes, great.

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Eat potatoes, not potato chips.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.650 align:middle line:90%
You like corn on the cob, great.

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Eat corn, not corn chips.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Eat food as grown, as
you could recognize

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:27.800 align:middle line:90%
it growing in the field.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And if your day is really based
on eating whole plant foods--

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.620 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, just a bowl
of colorful fruit or some

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:40.100 align:middle line:84%
whole-grain cereal
with the fruit on top,

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.390 align:middle line:84%
lunches and dinners based
on big, big colorful salads,

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and hearty vegetable soups,
big plates of steamed green

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and yellow vegetables,
entrees with legume features--

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.200 align:middle line:84%
lentils and beans and
peas and chickpeas,

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.110 align:middle line:84%
lentil stews and
healthy bean chilies--

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:59.960 align:middle line:90%
and fruit for desserts.

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And you fill your stomach
up with these kind of foods,

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.150 align:middle line:84%
you can't help but finding your
body turning into one that's

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:11.210 align:middle line:84%
lean and healthy and functioned
beautifully-- bowel function

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:14.570 align:middle line:84%
normalizes, skin
clear, and so many

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:16.670 align:middle line:84%
of the medical
problems that you would

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:19.700 align:middle line:84%
bring to a conventional
physician starts going away.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You see your medicine cabinet
getting emptier and emptier

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.350 align:middle line:90%
as you no longer need the pills.

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's not enough
just to be a vegan.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.750 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful that you are.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The animals benefit,
the earth benefits,

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.980 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to
be a healthy vegan.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.410 align:middle line:84%
People judge you from the
moment you walk in the door.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:38.080 align:middle line:90%
They see how you look.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you're overweight
with broken out skin,

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:44.240 align:middle line:84%
or you look pale and sallow,
and you've got no energy,

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.280 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you
say theoretically

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.610 align:middle line:84%
about the benefits of a
plant-based diet, who you are

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.010 align:middle line:90%
speaks louder than what you say.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
to set a good example,

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and that starts with nourishing
their precious body that we've

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:59.810 align:middle line:84%
been given with the
whole plant foods

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:02.000 align:middle line:90%
that nature intended for us.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.960 align:middle line:84%
It's very distressing for
me to watch my United States

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.450 align:middle line:84%
government spend
billions of dollars

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:10.610 align:middle line:84%
through the National
Institute of Health

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:13.580 align:middle line:84%
looking for the cause of the
degenerative diseases that

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:17.120 align:middle line:84%
are plaguing people
in Western societies.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.090 align:middle line:84%
They spend hundreds of
billions of dollars looking

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:22.490 align:middle line:84%
for the cause of
Type-2 diabetes,

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:26.810 align:middle line:84%
the cause of childhood obesity,
the cause of clogged arteries,

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:30.030 align:middle line:84%
the cause of high
blood pressure.

00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It makes me want
to find the biggest

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.410 align:middle line:84%
soapbox I can stand on, go down
to Washington, DC, stand on it,

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and yell as loudly as
I can, it's the food!

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It's what they're eating.

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Every five hours, they're
sending waves of fat and sugars

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:50.510 align:middle line:84%
through their bloodstream--
bacon and eggs for breakfast,

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.090 align:middle line:84%
cheeseburgers for lunch,
chicken for dinner,

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:56.000 align:middle line:84%
constantly deluging
their tissues

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.600 align:middle line:84%
with these saturated animal fats
and processed oils and refined

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.400 align:middle line:90%
sugars.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:05.180 align:middle line:84%
No wonder the arteries
clog up, and their tissues

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.570 align:middle line:84%
become inflamed, and all
these diseases manifest.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:09.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the food.

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I have a plaque in my office
that says in bold letters,

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.890 align:middle line:90%
it's the food.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:18.630 align:middle line:90%
It's been the food all along.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And when my patients sit
in front of me saying,

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Doctor, why am I overweight?

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Why am I on these pills
for high blood pressure?

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have this diabetes?

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:29.218 align:middle line:84%
I look at it with the
greatest compassion

00:56:29.218 --> 00:56:31.010 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
know before, but I just

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:34.130 align:middle line:84%
have to say as I
point to the plaque,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.020 align:middle line:84%
it's the food
you've been eating.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's get you on a
healthy plant-based diet,

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and let's watch
the magic happens

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.550 align:middle line:84%
your body gets truly healthy
as we give it the food it

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:46.130 align:middle line:90%
was designed to run on.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the questions we
get asked a lot from people

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:54.160 align:middle line:84%
transitioning from a standard
diet to a mostly raw whole

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.050 align:middle line:84%
foods, plant-based diet is, what
about the argument that when

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.740 align:middle line:84%
cooking food, we actually
get more nutrients and more

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:08.920 align:middle line:84%
available nutrients to the body,
such as lycopene in tomatoes?

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it is true that
if you cook tomatoes,

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:17.170 align:middle line:84%
the lycopene intensifies two
or three times the amount

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:19.780 align:middle line:84%
and becomes more
available to the body.

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But then you've got to ask
yourself the question--

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.470 align:middle line:90%
how much does the body need?

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, if nature has
provided the raw tomato

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.230 align:middle line:84%
with that amount
of lycopene in it,

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:37.480 align:middle line:84%
then that's exactly the amount
of lycopene that you need.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.290 align:middle line:84%
The other point is
that when you cook it,

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:45.100 align:middle line:84%
whole food is about a
symphony of nutrients--

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the fiber, the proteins,
the minerals, the vitamins.

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:52.150 align:middle line:84%
This symphony of
nutrients is indeed

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:57.010 align:middle line:84%
what the body uses to
absorb, to transport,

00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:00.400 align:middle line:84%
to make the best out of
all the other nutrients

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.260 align:middle line:90%
in that whole food.

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:06.610 align:middle line:84%
When you cook it, you
destroy all of the enzymes,

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the vitamins,
the coenzymes, the things

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:16.420 align:middle line:84%
that structure around the whole
food so that you can absorb

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and properly assimilate
that lycopene.

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So to simplify the
question, if nature

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:29.530 align:middle line:84%
has provided it in its raw form,
then that's the amount we need.

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> 14 years ago, I was
diagnosed with cancer,

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and I was told I had
six months to live.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wanted a refund
on that really seriously.

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:43.730 align:middle line:84%
At 50 years old, that
just wasn't enough for me.

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I also had
a little grandson,

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and I just was not
going to accept that.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking into
all of the other options that

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.290 align:middle line:90%
were available.

00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Even with the
recommended treatment,

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.640 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't going to make
any difference, apart

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.700 align:middle line:84%
from maybe an extra six
months of being ill.

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to just
to look into other ways

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:13.040 align:middle line:84%
that we could make a
difference to that prognosis.

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.470 align:middle line:90%
And what do you know?

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.950 align:middle line:84%
We didn't come up
with something.

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We decided to change
what we were eating,

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.310 align:middle line:84%
think more consciously
about every choice

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:25.750 align:middle line:90%
that we make in life.

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Within that six months,
it made the difference,

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:31.360 align:middle line:90%
and I no longer had cancer.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So that was also the beginning
of our being 100% raw vegan,

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:41.620 align:middle line:84%
which really was to
do with being 100%

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:45.340 align:middle line:84%
or having 100%
nutrient-laden food

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.520 align:middle line:84%
so that I would get 100%
the best I could possibly

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.200 align:middle line:90%
get for my body.

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:54.970 align:middle line:84%
In doing so, not only
did it cure the cancer,

00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:59.810 align:middle line:84%
but also, it made us more
healthy overall physically,

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.470 align:middle line:90%
mentally, and spiritually--

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:06.180 align:middle line:84%
basically getting
younger every day.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.120 align:middle line:84%
We decided that we would maybe
do something that would really

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.180 align:middle line:84%
catch the attention of
everybody worldwide,

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and that was to run
around Australia--

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:19.900 align:middle line:84%
run a marathon a day, every
day, for a whole year.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we talked
to anybody about it,

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
they said, well,
you know, you won't

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
be able to maintain it on
just fruit and vegetables.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So the point that we
were trying to make

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:35.440 align:middle line:84%
was that, yes, you can,
that the nutrition that you

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
can get from pure, raw,
whole food that's plant-based

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.140 align:middle line:90%
is 100% the best you can get.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So why would you choose to
have anything less than 100%

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.760 align:middle line:90%
for yourself, for your health?

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
realize how that's all

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
health of all living

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
beings and the whole
planet, it's a no-brainer.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So we just wanted to show
how simple and easy it is

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to actually achieve
something beyond imagination.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we did.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, we ran
a marathon a day,

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.000 align:middle line:90%
every day, around Australia.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
We had a crew with
us, two people that

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.290 align:middle line:90%
were driving our two vehicles.

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And every day that we
finished one marathon,

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
we would stop right there
and start the marathon again

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
the following day so that
it was a continuous run

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
all the way for
15,782 kilometers--

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:30.730 align:middle line:90%
around about 10,000 miles.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
We also included
Tasmania because that

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.930 align:middle line:90%
is part of Australia.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So people would ask us
often, what do you eat?

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did you fuel
yourself for this run?

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And as we said before,
the year before,

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
we were sort of
practicing how much

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.180 align:middle line:90%
that we could actually eat.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So during the run,
a typical day would

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.740 align:middle line:84%
be we get up in the
morning around 4:00,

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
make ourselves a
large smoothie--

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
lots of bananas,
grapefruit, any fruit

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that was sort of hanging
around the caravan.

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And we would drink that
slowly between 4:00 and 5:00

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.670 align:middle line:84%
in the morning because that
was to be the first part

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:11.860 align:middle line:90%
of our fuel for the day.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Then, we would take off
about 5:00 in the morning.

01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It was usually just
getting light, or perhaps

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
the first half an hour,
we'd be running in the dark.

01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, our crew would
actually catch up to us,

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and we'd stop and
have a small smack.

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And usually, our
small snack would

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
be anything from 5
to 10 bananas each,

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:35.768 align:middle line:84%
just to keep us going until
the next smoothie break.

01:02:35.768 --> 01:02:37.810 align:middle line:84%
The next smoothie break
was usually about halfway

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:39.200 align:middle line:90%
through the run.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So at about 20k, 13 miles
into the run, we would stop,

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and the crew would have made
us another large smoothie.

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Smoothies are great because
we could digest them

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
as we were running, and
they didn't take long

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.460 align:middle line:90%
to sort of chug down.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the end
of the day, the crew

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
would have made
us a large salad.

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So we'd have a
big bowl of salad,

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
usually with a couple
of avocados each

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:09.040 align:middle line:84%
because that time of the day, we
were often sort of craving fat.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So it seemed like
a logical thing.

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
If we had some, we'd have
a couple of avocados, maybe

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:17.080 align:middle line:90%
some olives, a big salad.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But also, just before that, we
would make a big veggie juice--

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
some beetroot, carrots,
apples, ginger, turmeric,

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.990 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And greens.

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And we had that as soon as we
stopped at the end of the day.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Then the salad and the avocados.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And by then, it was
time to go to bed,

01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:37.323 align:middle line:84%
try and get eight hours of
sleep before the next morning.

01:03:37.323 --> 01:03:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. so it was--

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
it was sleep, eat, and run;
sleep, eat, and run 366 times.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
We did not get injured
from running the whole run.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So 366 consecutive marathons, we
had no running injuries at all.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We had no blisters,
and that's because we

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.960 align:middle line:90%
were wearing barefoot shoes.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So we were-- the
shoes themselves,

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.610 align:middle line:84%
it's like being
barefoot, really.

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
about them is that they

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.090 align:middle line:90%
assimilate barefoot running.

01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So you run correctly
and naturally,

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.010 align:middle line:90%
so we had no injuries from that.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We did get injured a couple
of times from falling.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Both of us had cracked
ribs for different falls.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And also, our elbows and
knees took a bit of a whack

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.670 align:middle line:90%
there when we fell.

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:33.320 align:middle line:90%
But we continued.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to
actually recover,

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
not only from the running,
but from the injury as we ran.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.800 align:middle line:90%
So we were healing as we ran.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's really important

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
to make a point because
without the type of nutrients

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.475 align:middle line:84%
that we were getting, that
would not have been possible.

01:04:51.475 --> 01:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just doing
the running, I

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:54.433 align:middle line:84%
don't think, would
have been possible,

01:04:54.433 --> 01:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
either-- not to
continue for that long.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>> During the run, we
didn't take any supplements.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't take
any painkillers.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We just had, like
you can see here,

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.340 align:middle line:90%
just raw fruit and vegetables.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Within that six months,
there was already

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
a huge amount of people
sitting up and taking notice

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.860 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to know.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The question wasn't where do
you get your protein anymore.

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It was wow, this is amazing.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:26.060 align:middle line:84%
You're doing this on raw
fruits and vegetables.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
But our answer to that was,
that's actually not amazing.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.950 align:middle line:90%
That's how it should be.

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
What would be amazing
would be if we

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.680 align:middle line:90%
were doing it on anything else.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- it
was something that

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
was really starting to capture
the interest with everybody.

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
By the time we finished, we had
a huge amount of people there

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and media there to welcome
us in because not only had we

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
achieved something really
amazing for most people,

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
but we had also
set a world record.

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
The message that was
conveyed in the run,

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I think, was more important
than the run itself.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.710 align:middle line:84%
What the run did was bring
that message to the fore,

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and that message
is that we all need

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
to look at making more
conscious lifestyle choices.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So every choice in our
life is a conscious one.

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking
consciously about what

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.520 align:middle line:90%
the response to that choice is.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just with food,
but with everything we do.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody
in the world was

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to be thinking more consciously
about their choices,

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
what an amazing
change there would be.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
ask us if we're

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:46.430 align:middle line:84%
happy with what we achieved,
and the world record really

01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:48.740 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with us--

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.120 align:middle line:90%
even the run.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
What we achieved was bringing
this really positive message

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
to the world, and
we're continuing

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to do that in any
way we possibly can.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is a
much greater achievement.

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
The run itself-- yes, at
the ages of 64 for me and 68

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.820 align:middle line:90%
at the time for Alan--

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that pretty much says
a huge amount that you're never

01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
too old to make
changes that will make

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:21.050 align:middle line:90%
a difference to your health.

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:23.620 align:middle line:90%
And for myself, you never--

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, making those
changes for a difference

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
to your health, if you
have health issues,

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:35.180 align:middle line:90%
is huge as well, clearly.

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So 100% raw vegan
plant-based diet,

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:45.783 align:middle line:84%
which we've been on for 14 years
now just keeps getting better.

01:07:45.783 --> 01:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not that it makes a huge
difference in the beginning.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It certainly does,
but it continues

01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:52.730 align:middle line:90%
to make that difference.

01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Every day, there's
something different for us.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Every day, we think--

01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
we get up in the morning, we
go for our early morning run,

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and we think, what's
today going to bring?

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:07.310 align:middle line:84%
It's exciting because we
know that whatever it is,

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
we're going to enjoy it, and
we're capable of anything.

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that a lot of people

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:16.050 align:middle line:84%
probably don't understand
because they haven't been there

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:16.850 align:middle line:90%
yet.

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:22.189 align:middle line:84%
But when you're living a
fully conscious lifestyle,

01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:24.109 align:middle line:90%
anything's possible.

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Anything at all that you think
of that you might want to do,

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.899 align:middle line:84%
that you might want to
experience, it's possible.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, what's
possible beyond what

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.939 align:middle line:90%
we don't know yet?

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:39.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's really important.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I think a point that we must
make here, too, is so simple.

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
When we first went raw,
we were into making things

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
like raw pizzas and
raw lasagna, but after

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.979 align:middle line:84%
14 years of being raw, now,
we just eat a banana or make

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.630 align:middle line:90%
a smoothie.

01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:03.399 align:middle line:84%
We don't go to any trouble,
and it's so simple.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
We hear people say, ah, it's so
hard to be on a raw food diet,

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.590 align:middle line:90%
but it's just the opposite.

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:12.609 align:middle line:84%
The longer you do it,
the easier it gets.

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:15.545 align:middle line:84%
>> People with diabetes
are often concerned,

01:09:15.545 --> 01:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're even told
by their doctors,

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
don't eat fruit because
fruit has sugar in it,

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:21.083 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to raise
your blood sugar up,

01:09:21.083 --> 01:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%
make your diabetes worse.

01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:24.460 align:middle line:90%
But wait a minute.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Fruit sugars generally are
metabolized very quickly.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Healthy people do not walk
around high blood sugars

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
even though they
have some watermelon

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.020 align:middle line:90%
or cantaloupe for breakfast.

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
What's the problem with
the diabetic person?

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Is it really their
inability to handle sugars?

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the sugars
aren't the problem at all.

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the saturated fats
that they've been eating

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:48.729 align:middle line:84%
and the animal products
and the junky oils

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:50.529 align:middle line:90%
that they've been eating.

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
These fats get into
the muscle cells,

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and they block the
receptors for insulin.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So insulin, which
is necessary to move

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that sugar from the bloodstream
into the muscle cells where

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:04.540 align:middle line:90%
it can be burned--

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that insulin is blocked from
doing its essential action

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because the insulin receptors
are all clogged up with fat.

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's the fat in the diet
that's causing the insulin

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
resistance, and that
makes the sugar pile up

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.760 align:middle line:90%
in the bloodstream.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.825 align:middle line:84%
So the focus should not
be on the fruit sugar.

01:10:22.825 --> 01:10:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the fat
that person's been eating,

01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
saturated animal fats here.

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
The fats found in whole
vegetable, whole plant

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:34.090 align:middle line:90%
products--

01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
the ellagic acid in
avocados and nuts--

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:40.840 align:middle line:84%
really don't have this insulin
receptor blocking effect.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's the stearic
acid, palmitic acid

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that's in animal fat,
gets into the muscle

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
cells, blocks the
insulin receptors

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.510 align:middle line:90%
so insulin can't work.

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So the fruit gets blamed
when the real problem

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
is the saturated fats
from the animal products

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
that's clogging up
the insulin receptors.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So as we predictably see
Type-2 diabetes go away

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
as people adopt a whole
food, plant-based diet,

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.260 align:middle line:90%
take a walk every day.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:09.490 align:middle line:84%
They'll burn that fat that's in
their muscle cells for energy,

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and their insulin
receptors open up.

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And the insulin they
make starts working fine.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And they find they can then
eat the apple or the banana

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and the cantaloupe, and
their blood sugar does not

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:20.488 align:middle line:84%
go to dangerous
levels, and they're

01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:22.460 align:middle line:90%
able to eat fruit just fine.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
fruit and the sugar

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.460 align:middle line:84%
elevations that come from it
in the diabetic person-- that's

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.020 align:middle line:90%
the tail of the dog.

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go up to
the business end there.

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the fats that they're
eating that are clogging up

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
their insulin receptors that's
really causing the high blood

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:36.510 align:middle line:90%
sugars.

01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So fruits are wonderful
parts of the human diet,

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and they add the
sweetness in life.

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm a big fan of
ample amounts of fruit.

01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But keep your instant receptors
open from a plant-based diet,

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be able to have
all the fruit you want

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.077 align:middle line:84%
without worrying about what
it's doing to your blood sugar

01:11:52.077 --> 01:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
levels.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the fundamental
key to healing is for us all

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for our own health.

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Without taking that
responsibility,

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:10.200 align:middle line:84%
we tend to just be leaving the
outcome up to somebody else.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.580 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we notice that
there's something wrong,

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
we make an appointment
to see a doctor,

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and we ask that
doctor to fix us.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
We can tend to find
ourselves looking for excuses

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't need
to take responsibility.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we
need to realize is

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can't expect our
doctors to know everything.

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
A GP, after all, is a
general practitioner.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.410 align:middle line:90%
We go to the doctor.

01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
He or she diagnoses
what they think

01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
we have according to the
symptoms we are presenting with

01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and writes us a script
for what is generally

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:56.170 align:middle line:90%
used to treat that condition.

01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So what we find
happening is that we

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
are given a prescription
for medication

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to take away the swelling,
medication to take away

01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:08.820 align:middle line:90%
the pain.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is we're
treating the symptoms and not

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:15.610 align:middle line:90%
the cause.

01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So if we were driving
our car down the road,

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and a red flashing light
came on the dashboard,

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
do we pull over and find the
cause of the warning light?

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Or do we continue to
drive and just disconnect

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the red flashing light so
that the symptoms are gone,

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
but the underlying
cause is still there?

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And if we do nothing
but treat the symptoms,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.620 align:middle line:90%
the cause is still there.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.980 align:middle line:90%
We're heading for a disaster.

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
We must also acknowledge that
we have a medical system which

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is full of highly-trained,
skillful surgeons, doctors,

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and dedicated nurses, and
that's fantastic for trauma,

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:08.170 align:middle line:84%
for tissue injuries,
for broken bones,

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
for putting bodies
back together.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But for disease management,
the system is sadly lacking.

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
A pill for every ill is a system
built on treating symptoms

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and not causes.

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest killers
in civilized countries

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.970 align:middle line:90%
is prescription medications.

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
These figures do
not come from people

01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:36.800 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to commit suicide
or take pills to get high.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.630 align:middle line:84%
These figures are
coming from those

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:44.180 align:middle line:84%
who have had adverse reactions
to prescribed medications.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Another common held belief is
that our government wouldn't

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
do anything that
could potentially

01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:57.030 align:middle line:90%
harm ourselves or our families.

01:14:57.030 --> 01:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Our governments and
our medical system

01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
can certainly be sincere,
but they can also

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.770 align:middle line:90%
be sincerely wrong.

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
After all, it was
our governments

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
that approved and encouraged
the use of thalidomide, DDT,

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
asbestos, and up until
recently was filling

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.920 align:middle line:84%
the mouths of our children with
mercury-based fillings, which

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
they are now trying
to safely get rid of

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.680 align:middle line:90%
and replace with something safe.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, with things like the
internet and social media,

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
it is extremely easy for us
to become self-empowered.

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the most beautiful word
ever written at any time in any

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
language and human
history came from India,

01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
from the Upanishads,
3,000 years ago--

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
"ahimsa"-- non-violence
to any living being.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all aspire to live
a life of non-violence.

01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that, by
definition, we must be vegan--

01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
not because it describes
our politics, our religion,

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
our diet, or our
lifestyle, but because it

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:24.670 align:middle line:90%
describes our character.

01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It says, we eschew violence
in whatever form confronts us.

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
In human history, only
100 billion human beings

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.530 align:middle line:90%
have ever lived.

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
7 billion people
are alive today,

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and we humans torture and
kill 2 billion sentient living

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.820 align:middle line:90%
animals every week.

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.390 align:middle line:84%
We stab and suffocate
1 billion ocean animals

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
every three hours.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
10,000 entire species
are wiped out every year

01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
because of the actions
of one, and we now

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
face the sixth mass extinction
in cosmological history.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
If any other organism
did this, a biologist

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.220 align:middle line:90%
would call it a virus.

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It is a crime of
unimaginable proportions.

01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Alvin Toffler wrote, "the
illiterate of the 21st century

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
will not be those who
cannot read and write,

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but those who cannot learn,
unlearn, and relearn."

01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:25.320 align:middle line:90%


01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would know that
water is the new oil.

01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Nations will soon be
going to war over it.

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I drilled my first bore well
as a young teenage Boy Scout,

01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and we struck sweet
water at 80 feet.

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're building
an orphanage nearby,

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and at 800 feet,
we're sucking mud.

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
In China, at 3,000 feet,
the drill head is still dry.

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would be outraged
if 10 jumbo jets crashed

01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:57.460 align:middle line:90%
every day with no survivors.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
number of children

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.980 align:middle line:84%
who die every day from
water-related diseases.

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.730 align:middle line:90%


01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:10.140 align:middle line:84%
The mighty Colorado River,
the Rio Grande, the Indus,

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and the Yellow Rivers now
no longer reach the sea,

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
sucked dry by the meat
and dairy industry,

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
whilst 3 billion people suffer
today from water scarcity.

01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So why do I speak
to you about water?

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes
50,000 liters of water

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.100 align:middle line:90%
to produce one kilo of beef.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It takes 1,000 liters of water
to produce one liter of milk.

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And a dairy man gets $0.28
cents a liter for it.

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
What a preposterously
stupid industry.

01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
1 billion people
today are hungry.

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:49.210 align:middle line:84%
20 million people will die
this year from malnutrition.

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Cutting meat
consumption by only 10%

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
will feed 100 million
people, and going vegan

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.050 align:middle line:90%
will end malnutrition forever.

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And food prices
are skyrocketing.

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
It used to cost me
$197 a ton for Thai

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
rice for my projects
in Southeast Asia,

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and then it went up to $1,015--

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.590 align:middle line:84%
a fivefold increase
in five months.

01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And poor countries sell
their grain to the West

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:20.620 align:middle line:84%
while for hard currency whilst
their own children starve

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
in their arms, and the
West feeds it to livestock

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.860 align:middle line:90%
so we can eat a steak.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I'm not the only
one who sees that as a crime.

01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, every
morsel of meat we eat

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
is slapping the tear-stained
face of a hungry child.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:43.050 align:middle line:84%
When I look into her
eyes, do I remain silent?

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
The world can
produce enough food

01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
for everyone's need, but not
enough for everyone's greed.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
If everyone ate a Western
diet, we would need two planets

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:54.470 align:middle line:90%
to feed them.

01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
We've only got one,
and she is dying.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.600 align:middle line:90%


01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, greenhouse gas emissions
from livestock now vastly

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.490 align:middle line:90%
exceed those of transport--

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
cars, trains, ships, buses,
lorries, bikes, the whole lot.

01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Siberian permafrost
is now a ticking time bomb.

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
When it releases its sequestered
gas, the game is over.

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure many of you know about
the condition of the Yamal

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Peninsula in Russia.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
If not, please have a look at
the pictures on the internet.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.310 align:middle line:90%
It is quite a terrifying sight.

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
The Himalayan ice fields are
correctly called the third pole

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
because they feed half
the world's population

01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
through the Ganges, the
Indus, the Brahmaputra,

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the Yellow River, the
Irrawaddy, and the Mekong.

01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And these glaciers
are melting fast.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I gave a talk to 2,000 wealthy
entrepreneurs in New Delhi,

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and in the audience
was Amartya Sen, who

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
had recently won India's
Nobel Prize in Economics.

01:20:58.570 --> 01:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Muhammad Yunus
after he won the Nobel Peace

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Prize that all the
good that he had done

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:06.760 align:middle line:84%
would vanish when
Bangladesh drowns,

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
to say nothing about Manila,
Mumbai, Bangkok, or Ho Chi Minh

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:12.230 align:middle line:90%
City.

01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And more recently, we
had dinner with Al Gore

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and presented him
with the same numbers.

01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks ago, I gave
a speech here in Melbourne

01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:23.200 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Peter Doherty,
who won Australia's Nobel

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Prize in medicine.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And I presented these gentlemen
with all the same numbers

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and algorithms, and no arguments
from any of these Nobel

01:21:33.730 --> 01:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
laureates, but
plenty of arguments

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.390 align:middle line:84%
from the meat and dairy
lobby and the politicians who

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
seem to toe the line whenever
the lobby group calls.

01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
So Upton Sinclair was right.

01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It isn't possible to get a
man to understand something

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.570 align:middle line:84%
when his salary depends on
him not understanding it.

01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:56.940 align:middle line:90%


01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Admiral [INAUDIBLE],, the chief
of US warfighting requirements,

01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
said, we have learned that
nations will raid and invade

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.680 align:middle line:90%
long before they starve.

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And we freak out in
Australia when 1,000 refugees

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.285 align:middle line:90%
arrive on our shores.

01:22:12.285 --> 01:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, just imagine
greenhouse gas emissions

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
hitting 500 parts per million
or a three degree temperature

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
rise, creating 100
million eco-refugees.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
This calamity will reshape the
geopolitical landscape forever.

01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:32.080 align:middle line:90%
We are facing the perfect storm.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
If any other nation
were to develop weapons

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that could wreak such
havoc on the planet,

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
we would launch a
pre-emptive military strike

01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and bomb it back
into the Bronze Age.

01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But we can't because it
is not a rogue state.

01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:48.190 align:middle line:90%
It's an industry.

01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The good news is, we
don't have to bomb it.

01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:53.890 align:middle line:90%
We can just stop buying it.

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:56.380 align:middle line:90%
So George Bush was wrong.

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
The Axis of Evil does not
run through Iraq, Iran,

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.120 align:middle line:90%
or North Korea.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It runs through
our dining tables.

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Weapons of mass destruction
are our knives and forks,

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and farmers are the ones
with the most to gain.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Farming wouldn't end.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
It would boom-- only the
product line would change.

01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I often say that veganism
is the Swiss army

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
knife of an ethical
and authentic future.

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
One instrument solves
all our ethical,

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
our financial, environmental,
water, and human health

01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
problems and ends
animal cruelty forever.

01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Veganism is the enchanted key.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It opens locked doors to secret
rooms in your own castle.

01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:46.900 align:middle line:84%
The Stone Age didn't end
because we ran out of stones.

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
This meat industry will end
because we run out of excuses.

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Veganism is the engine of
redirected economic growth.

01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Governments would love us.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
New industries would
emerge and flourish.

01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Health insurance
premiums would plummet.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Hospital waiting
lists would disappear.

01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Veganism gives us
the peace dividend.

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I addressed the World
Parliament of Religions,

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and I said that the peace
map is drawn on a menu.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Peace is not just
the absence of war.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.700 align:middle line:90%
It is the presence of justice.

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Justice must be blind to
race, color, religion,

01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and to species.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
If it is not blind, it will
be used as a weapon of terror,

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and today, there is
unimaginable terror

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:40.660 align:middle line:84%
in those ghastly gulags we call
factory farms and vivisection

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:43.610 align:middle line:90%
laboratories.

01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
As Lord Acton said, it is a
place where absolute power

01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:51.140 align:middle line:90%
corrupts absolutely.

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So talking about peace
while still killing animals

01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
is like loving literature
and burning books.

01:24:58.670 --> 01:25:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They are mutually
exclusive ideas.

01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They are incompatible
in the same way

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that science is incompatible
with the Flat Earth Society.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
The last sentence of
Scott Fitzgerald's book

01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
The Great Gatsby
reads, "so we beat on,

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
boats against the tide,
drawn back ceaselessly

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.150 align:middle line:90%
into the past."

01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I ask you-- are we to live
forever and a sick, smug,

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.600 align:middle line:90%
and cruel past?

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.422 align:middle line:84%
Our animal cousins have survived
millions of years of evolution.

01:25:30.422 --> 01:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They've earned the right to
share this planet with us

01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:33.990 align:middle line:90%
in peace.

01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have
waited long enough.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Judge White's closing words
in the Bonfire of the Vanities

01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
were, "the law is humanity's
clumsy attempt at decency."

01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's join this battle in the
war that decency cannot afford

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:56.980 align:middle line:84%
to lose because in the end,
only three things matter--

01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:01.060 align:middle line:84%
how deeply you loved,
how gently you lived,

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and how gracefully
you let go of things

01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:05.740 align:middle line:90%
that were not meant for you.

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Meat was not meant for you.

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:10.330 align:middle line:90%


01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> One evening, I was
pontificating to a friend about

01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:16.360 align:middle line:84%
wanting to be a
truly peaceful man,

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
but I was doing it while
polishing off a 16-ounce

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
porterhouse steak at
the local steakhouse.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and said, Michael, it's

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.050 align:middle line:84%
all well and good,
but if you really

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
want to get the violent
side of your life,

01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:31.120 align:middle line:84%
you might start with that
piece of muscle on your plate

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
because in fulfilling
your desire

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.440 align:middle line:84%
for that meat in
your mouth, you are

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.320 align:middle line:84%
paying for the
death of that animal

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and for the next
animal on the assembly

01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.900 align:middle line:90%
line in the slaughterhouse.

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as he said that,
a series of rationalizations

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:50.440 align:middle line:84%
welled up inside of
me-- oh, well, that's

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
what they raised them for,
and it's dead already.

01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But as I was about to say this,
that same little voice said,

01:26:58.270 --> 01:27:00.640 align:middle line:90%
you know, he's right.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.220 align:middle line:90%
He's right.

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I am complicit in
that animal's death

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.270 align:middle line:84%
every time I pull out my wallet
and pay for a meat-based meal.

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I could no
longer do that if I

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a man not only
of peace, but of integrity,

01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:16.430 align:middle line:90%
knowing what I knew.

01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I had done much my growing
up on my uncle's dairy farm

01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:19.670 align:middle line:90%
in Wisconsin.

01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew where meat came from,
and I knew the truth of dairy,

01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and I knew at that point
I could no longer pay

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.592 align:middle line:90%
for these animal-based products.

01:27:29.592 --> 01:27:31.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, they say, once
you look behind the curtain,

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.560 align:middle line:84%
you can't pretend you don't
know what's behind the curtain.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And that curtain had
been ripped down for me.

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.405 align:middle line:90%
There was no escaping the truth.

01:27:39.405 --> 01:27:42.315 align:middle line:90%

01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:56.155 align:middle line:84%
>> These are Scottish Highland
cattle that we rescued.

01:27:56.155 --> 01:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Because we're vegan,
we don't eat them,

01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and they come from a guy that
made meat pies out of them.

01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So we went and
bought these four,

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and they just live
out their life here.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.360 align:middle line:90%
We use the manure.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.670 align:middle line:84%
They were not used
to humans at all

01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:15.760 align:middle line:84%
when they came here about
2 and 1/2 years ago,

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and now they're, just with a
little bit of love and care,

01:28:18.810 --> 01:28:20.580 align:middle line:90%
they're completely friendly.

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.200 align:middle line:90%
They come when they're called.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.230 align:middle line:84%
They're beautiful, gentle
creatures, lovely animals.

01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And these are not chemically
treated or anything.

01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:32.400 align:middle line:84%
They're 100% organic,
free roaming.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
We've got Hamish at the
end, Fergus, Dougal here,

01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:41.120 align:middle line:90%
and Angus there.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.800 align:middle line:90%


01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Nature provides it with
an instinct to live.

01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:49.230 align:middle line:90%
It wants to live.

01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It wants to protect its young.

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It runs from danger.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It goes towards comfort and
warmth, and that's what we do,

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's what all
living creatures do.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.650 align:middle line:90%
And yet we take that--

01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:04.340 align:middle line:84%
we take that from them,
and we end their lives

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.840 align:middle line:84%
just because we want to eat
them when we don't even need to.

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Even the United Nations have
said that we have to change.

01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The only way the world
is going to survive

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
is to eventually become vegan
because we're eating ourselves

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.430 align:middle line:90%
off the planet.

01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:20.374 align:middle line:84%
We can no longer
sustain the way we eat.

01:29:20.374 --> 01:29:23.853 align:middle line:90%

01:29:23.853 --> 01:29:30.820 align:middle line:90%


01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Raw food helped to
heal my body, but first,

01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I had to heal my mind,
because without addressing

01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the tendencies of the mind,
it can sabotage your efforts

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.360 align:middle line:84%
towards self-healing, simply
through your unloving belief

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.930 align:middle line:90%
system.

01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's important to
clarify that whilst diet

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.270 align:middle line:84%
was a huge component
of my healing,

01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:53.300 align:middle line:84%
it was part of a
holistic approach.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:55.580 align:middle line:84%
One week after my
attempted suicide,

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I went into a personal
development seminar.

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I went into it
prepared to give it

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:03.260 align:middle line:84%
everything I had because
I knew that whatever

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I was doing or believed was not
working to help shift my life.

01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for me,
every time I took a pill

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
or came out of the
doctor's office,

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I had the thought
there is something

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.260 align:middle line:90%
seriously wrong with me.

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Life reinforced this
thought over and over again

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:24.110 align:middle line:90%
because that is what I believed.

01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:28.220 align:middle line:84%
That is what was always
in the back of my mind.

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
My identity had become
depression itself,

01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and no matter how
hard I tried, it

01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:37.670 align:middle line:84%
was never enough to fix the
person that I believed myself

01:30:37.670 --> 01:30:39.360 align:middle line:90%
to be.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I was so numbed
by the medication

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that I knew I was capable of
walking in front of a truck

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
or slamming the car into a
tree because I felt no fear.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I became more and more
disconnected, and as irrational

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.870 align:middle line:84%
as it seems now, I
had convinced myself

01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that my children and family
would be better off without me.

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I followed
through with one of my longings

01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to go to sleep forever
by taking an overdose.

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I came out of that seminar with
a profoundly different view

01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
how I perceived life.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I used that new understanding
as the catalyst for change.

01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:25.980 align:middle line:84%
That weekend, I decided I
was willing to do whatever

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
it took to help myself,
and my love for my children

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:37.800 align:middle line:90%
provided me with the motivation.

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I continued on for several
years participating

01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:42.720 align:middle line:84%
in personal
development seminars,

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and my life began to really
transform on many levels.

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I had begun to love and
accept myself more in a way

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.780 align:middle line:90%
that I never had before.

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And from that new energy
that I was emanating,

01:31:55.650 --> 01:32:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I met a man that loved
me to the same degree

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that I had finally
come to love myself.

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:07.230 align:middle line:84%
He later became the love
of my life and my husband.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But from time to
time, depression still

01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:11.070 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmed me.

01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
These times were
compounded by the thought,

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:17.100 align:middle line:84%
after all the work I
have done on myself,

01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm back at square one.

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:22.830 align:middle line:84%
In those times, it seemed
in vain and hopeless.

01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:25.020 align:middle line:84%
All along, my husband
Stuart could clearly

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:27.270 align:middle line:84%
see that there was a
person inside of me that

01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:32.100 align:middle line:84%
was being extinguished by the
heavy medication that I was on.

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:35.100 align:middle line:84%
He believed that my
only chance to enjoy

01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
life and true happiness
was to come off medication.

01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And deep down, I
knew that was true.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I decided to try
coming off medication

01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and also decided that it
was important to do so

01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:48.820 align:middle line:90%
with support.

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We went to Stuart's
doctor, who was

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.710 align:middle line:84%
very supportive
about slowly reducing

01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:55.860 align:middle line:84%
the medication over
time, which, for me, was

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:58.230 align:middle line:90%
an eight-month period.

01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:00.870 align:middle line:84%
In no way are we
suggesting that anyone

01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:03.060 align:middle line:90%
should come off medication.

01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:07.020 align:middle line:84%
We're simply sharing what
has worked for me personally,

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and not everyone chooses the
conventional medicine path.

01:33:11.490 --> 01:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It was very important not
to come off medication

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:18.900 align:middle line:84%
by myself without the guidance
of a supportive doctor

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:22.950 align:middle line:84%
because they know more about the
effects of prescription drugs

01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:25.240 align:middle line:90%
than we do.

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But the greatest support
of all came from Stuart.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I can not emphasize
enough how important

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.920 align:middle line:84%
it is to have a support
person close to you that

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
becomes your voice of
reassurance and reason

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
when you experience
withdrawals or confusion.

01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:45.920 align:middle line:84%
There were moments
as I was withdrawing

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that I thought I should go
back on medication because I

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.900 align:middle line:90%
felt worse.

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Stuart's voice
reassuring me that that

01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is a normal symptom
of withdrawal

01:33:56.750 --> 01:34:00.245 align:middle line:84%
and that it will pass was what
got me through to the end.

01:34:00.245 --> 01:34:03.010 align:middle line:90%


01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Years of medication had
wiped precious memories

01:34:06.610 --> 01:34:08.620 align:middle line:90%
of raising my children.

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But for a time,
the medication was

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.360 align:middle line:84%
what was needed in my
journey, as it showed me

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
the contrast of a
life half lived.

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
It taught me a great
deal about how much I

01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:23.170 align:middle line:84%
value the full array of
human feelings and emotions

01:34:23.170 --> 01:34:26.050 align:middle line:90%
in this experience called life.

01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:29.440 align:middle line:84%
We then came across the
work of Dr. Joe Dispenza,

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and it really resonated with me.

01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I began to feel
excited by the prospect

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:40.690 align:middle line:84%
that my mind, my
conditioning was changeable.

01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:44.470 align:middle line:84%
In scientific terms, it's
called neuroplasticity.

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
When I stopped to
consider this prospect,

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I realized that my
mind had already

01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
been changed so
profoundly about life

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.770 align:middle line:84%
since I had begun
my healing journey.

01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But there were obviously
still some latent old beliefs

01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and conditioning
that I was still

01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:03.280 align:middle line:84%
buying into from time to
time that allowed depression

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.400 align:middle line:84%
to sneak up on me
and pull me under.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Stuart recognized
and pointed out

01:35:08.230 --> 01:35:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that it mostly centered
around expectation--

01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:15.700 align:middle line:84%
expectations that I had of
myself that I continually felt

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:18.160 align:middle line:90%
was unable to fulfill.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
He totally hit the
nail on the head.

01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We both then went to some of
Dr. Joe Dispenza's seminars

01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:27.370 align:middle line:84%
that opened up our understanding
of the power of the mind,

01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and we began to
regularly meditate.

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:34.480 align:middle line:84%
What this taught me was
the power of awareness.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I began to realize that my
thoughts and beliefs created

01:35:38.230 --> 01:35:40.690 align:middle line:90%
my subjective reality.

01:35:40.690 --> 01:35:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts have no power of their
own unless we believe them.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Over time, I began to recognize
the familiar unloving thoughts

01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:50.110 align:middle line:90%
as they arose.

01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And rather than automatically
believing and following them

01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:59.590 align:middle line:84%
as I had always done, I began
to ignore them out of existence.

01:35:59.590 --> 01:36:02.920 align:middle line:84%
A thought is just a thought,
but we automatically

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.990 align:middle line:84%
grab hold of a
thought and follow it,

01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:08.020 align:middle line:84%
giving it its life through
the associated feelings

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, which
then perpetuates

01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.880 align:middle line:84%
a cycle of feeling
the way we think

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and thinking the way we feel.

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:19.120 align:middle line:84%
The nature of the mind means
we can't stop or block thoughts

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.770 align:middle line:84%
from coming, but we can develop
our awareness of thought

01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and choose to ignore the
ones that limit or hurt us,

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
which effectively pulls the
plug on their power over us.

01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I feel that it's no coincidence
that around this time,

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.610 align:middle line:84%
we became ethical vegans after
watching a deeply distressing

01:36:39.610 --> 01:36:41.965 align:middle line:84%
exposé on the live
export industry.

01:36:41.965 --> 01:36:45.250 align:middle line:90%


01:36:45.250 --> 01:36:47.770 align:middle line:84%
When we became vegan,
we were immediately

01:36:47.770 --> 01:36:51.880 align:middle line:84%
concerned about ensuring that
we would get the right nutrition

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because we'd been
brought up to believe

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and conditioned to
believe that we needed

01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:00.970 align:middle line:84%
meat and dairy, particularly
for iron, protein, and calcium.

01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Thus began our
self-education and diet,

01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and its impact on our
physical and emotional health,

01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:13.240 align:middle line:84%
researching, watching DVDs
such as "Food Matters"; "Forks

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Over Knives"; "Food That Kills";
"Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead";

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.980 align:middle line:90%
"Simply Raw"; and many more.

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
What we also discovered
was that eating

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
nutritionally-dead,
processed foods

01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and also eating dead
animals takes away life

01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:32.210 align:middle line:84%
by promoting disease,
whereas eating

01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:36.380 align:middle line:84%
nutritionally-rich, living plant
foods that contain the Earth's

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:39.470 align:middle line:84%
vital life force give
more life by helping

01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:42.800 align:middle line:90%
to prevent and reverse disease.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:46.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a significant
amount of our energy required

01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:49.940 align:middle line:84%
for the body to break down
the cooked deformed proteins

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:52.310 align:middle line:84%
in meat, which is
completely devoid

01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:55.310 align:middle line:84%
of fiber, making it very
difficult for the body

01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to digest.

01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:01.790 align:middle line:84%
This energy could be freed up
as available energy for healing,

01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:04.670 align:middle line:90%
rather than used for digestion.

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Animal products are also
inflammatory in the body.

01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:10.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is now
commonly believed

01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
that at the root of nearly
all disease is inflammation.

01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:16.660 align:middle line:90%


01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We also didn't realize
or think about the fact

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that when an animal
is about to be killed,

01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:24.350 align:middle line:84%
it releases an enormous
amount of adrenaline

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and cortisol into
its system as part

01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:28.880 align:middle line:84%
of the fight-and-flight
mechanism for survival

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.470 align:middle line:90%
because it's afraid.

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:32.390 align:middle line:84%
This adrenaline and
cortisol is then

01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:35.000 align:middle line:84%
consumed by us when
we eat its flesh,

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and in my opinion, contributed
to my own anxiety levels.

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:41.810 align:middle line:84%
We learned that
all dairy products

01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:45.110 align:middle line:84%
contain significant levels
of hormones such as estrogen

01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:46.790 align:middle line:84%
because in order
to produce milk,

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:51.290 align:middle line:84%
cows need to be kept in almost
constant cycle of pregnancy.

01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Consuming these
hormones can interfere

01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:58.250 align:middle line:84%
with our body's own natural
hormonal balance, which,

01:38:58.250 --> 01:39:01.940 align:middle line:84%
in effect, could contribute
to fluctuations in mood,

01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:05.270 align:middle line:84%
among other serious
health issues associated

01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:08.690 align:middle line:84%
with consuming a substance
that is not meant for us.

01:39:08.690 --> 01:39:12.110 align:middle line:90%


01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Our concern about missing out on
nutrients in our new lifestyle

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:20.040 align:middle line:84%
choice turned into inspiration
as we discovered testimonial

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.340 align:middle line:84%
after testimonial of
people healing themselves

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.290 align:middle line:84%
of major illness
through following

01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:27.540 align:middle line:90%
a whole food, plant-based diet.

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And what was even more
exciting was the realization

01:39:31.290 --> 01:39:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that eating an abundance
of raw plant foods

01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:37.980 align:middle line:84%
could not only heal,
but help the body

01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:41.010 align:middle line:90%
to experience optimal health.

01:39:41.010 --> 01:39:44.700 align:middle line:84%
When I realized the potential
of this, I said to Stuart,

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
optimum health feels like.

01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going raw for 30
days to see what happens.

01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately said
he wanted to join me.

01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:59.100 align:middle line:84%
A whole new world of how we
perceived food opened up.

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:02.790 align:middle line:84%
It was intimidating and
exciting at the same time,

01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:05.970 align:middle line:84%
as we learned new
ways of preparing food

01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and experimented
with raw recipes.

01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:12.780 align:middle line:84%
We ate whatever fresh fruit
was in season for breakfast,

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and apart from raw meals,
salads, and snacks,

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.740 align:middle line:84%
we also juiced and
planted vegetables.

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.900 align:middle line:84%
In the first couple
of days, we already

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:24.570 align:middle line:84%
noticed that we felt
so much more energy

01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and had a natural, happy high
from the simple yet highly

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.180 align:middle line:84%
nutritious living food that
we were putting into our body.

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:35.580 align:middle line:84%
We both went through
some mild detox symptoms

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.460 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning,
but they soon passed,

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and we began to feel
strong and alive in a way

01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that we had not
experienced before.

01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I felt a new loving
connection and appreciation

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
of the vibrant food
from nature's garden

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that I can only
describe as spiritual.

01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we both
lost unhealthy weight.

01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:01.470 align:middle line:84%
We had very regular
bowel movements.

01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Our skin changed,
and our energy levels

01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:07.230 align:middle line:84%
had increased so much that
our bodies were literally

01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:12.030 align:middle line:84%
asking for more exercise, which
is also key for depression.

01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:16.110 align:middle line:84%
One day, I ventured off on
our daily walk by myself,

01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and as I was walking,
something inside me

01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:22.860 align:middle line:90%
said run, run, just run.

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So I broke into a jog,
and before I knew it,

01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I was running for the first
time since my teenage years.

01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:31.770 align:middle line:90%
It felt so good.

01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I felt so alive and free
of my chronic fatigue that

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:38.640 align:middle line:90%
had plagued me for so long.

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It's been many years now since
our raw for 30 days challenge,

01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and we have never looked back.

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.980 align:middle line:84%
We're now eating a
high raw vegan diet

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:49.110 align:middle line:84%
rather than 100%
raw, which we have

01:41:49.110 --> 01:41:52.790 align:middle line:84%
found more sustainable
for us in the long term.

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But we were 100% raw whilst
our body was healing.

01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to be all raw
to experience the huge health

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:04.380 align:middle line:84%
benefits of switching to a
whole food, plant-based diet.

01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.480 align:middle line:84%
We also did a plant-based
nutrition course

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.940 align:middle line:84%
so that we could further
integrate our knowledge

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:12.810 align:middle line:84%
about nutrition and share what
we had learned and experienced

01:42:12.810 --> 01:42:15.840 align:middle line:90%
firsthand for ourselves.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Today, I am happier
and healthier

01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:20.910 align:middle line:90%
than I have ever been.

01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course, I still
experience sadness sometimes,

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:24.900 align:middle line:90%
like everyone else.

01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But rather than resisting these
emotions, which only creates

01:42:28.230 --> 01:42:31.890 align:middle line:84%
more suffering, I allow
them to come and go,

01:42:31.890 --> 01:42:34.410 align:middle line:90%
knowing that they are fleeting.

01:42:34.410 --> 01:42:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I realize that it is all part
of our dualistic existence,

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:41.750 align:middle line:84%
such as happy and
sad, life and death,

01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and we can't have one
without the other.

01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Simply by putting
more life into my body

01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:49.790 align:middle line:84%
in the way of enzyme-rich
food and oxygen

01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:55.480 align:middle line:84%
through regular exercise, I
feel literally full of life.

01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.330 align:middle line:84%
We all have the power
to change ourselves.

01:42:58.330 --> 01:43:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we change,
life changes with us.

01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But it takes dropping
self-definitions

01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:06.300 align:middle line:90%
and expectations.

01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It takes realizing that
without sadness, we wouldn't

01:43:09.690 --> 01:43:11.640 align:middle line:90%
know what happiness is.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It takes recognizing
the blessings

01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:16.200 align:middle line:90%
amongst the pain of the past.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It takes letting go
and being vulnerable.

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It takes opening up to new
