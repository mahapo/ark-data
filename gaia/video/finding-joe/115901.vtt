00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Many years ago
in Thailand, there

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
was a temple that was called
the Temple of the Golden Buddha.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.862 align:middle line:84%
And there was a huge
statue of a golden Buddha.

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And word came to this
village where the monastery

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle line:84%
was that an army from
a neighboring country

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.852 align:middle line:90%
was about to invade.

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:59.916 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And they got the
brilliant scheme

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
to cover the golden Buddha,
which was quite large, with mud

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and concrete so that it looked
basically like a stone Buddha,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.764 align:middle line:84%
and the army would
perceive no value in it.

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:15.706 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
this army rolled in

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.164 align:middle line:90%
with its caissons and weapons.

00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And as they passed
by the monastery,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
they saw nothing but
a big stone Buddha.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.324 align:middle line:84%
And they had no
reason to plunder it.

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, years went by, because
the army continued to occupy it,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:84%
until there was a time in the
monastery in the village when

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
no one remembered that
the Buddha was golden,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
until one day a young monk
was sitting on the Buddha

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:90%
meditating on his knee.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And as he got up, a
little piece of concrete

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
happened to crack off, and
he saw something shiny.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And he realized there
was gold under there.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And so he ran to his
fellow monks and said,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha is golden,
the Buddha is golden!

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And they all came
out, and they realized

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:90%
he was telling the truth.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And they took their
picks and hammers,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and eventually they
unearthed the Golden Buddha.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:10%
Now what's the metaphor here?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:10%
The metaphor is that each
of us is golden by nature.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:10%
We were born golden.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:90%
We were born high.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:90%
We were born knowing.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
We were born connected
to our bliss.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
We were born knowing truth.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
We were born knowing everything
that every great spiritual

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:90%
master has ever said.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:84%
We were one with the Christ,
the Buddha, everyone.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.536 align:middle line:84%
But then we went to
school, and they said,

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
you have to dress like
this, and this what boys do,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:90%
and this is what girls do.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.265 align:middle line:90%
This is what black people do.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
This is what white people
do, on and on and on.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we developed a casing
of stone over the Buddha

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to a point where at a young
age, maybe four, five, six,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
or seven, we believe that we
were the stone Buddha, not

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:90%
the golden one.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And then something comes
along that cracks our casing.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's an injury, a
divorce, financial setbacks,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
a governmental
change, something that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:84%
really scares us and
bugs us and knocks off

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:90%
a piece of our armor.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And only in that moment of
the armor of being knocked off

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
do you get to look
inside and see the gold.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you,
friend, that the moment you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.852 align:middle line:84%
see that gold, the
armor and the concrete

00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:90%
will never satisfy you again.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you truly answer
the true hero's adventure.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And all you want to do
for the rest of your life

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.108 align:middle line:84%
is pick away the stone, because
the gold is so much more fun.

is a philosopher,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.472 align:middle line:84%
a man who had this ability
to see the truth in a world

of that in many ways.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:10%
He studied all of these
classical myth traditions.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:10%
And he actually
started by studying

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:10%
Native American mythology.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:10%
And he wound up studying
the aboriginal cultures.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:10%
He studied Greek mythology.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.166 align:middle line:90%
He studied Arthurian legend.

Campbell came along,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:10%
certainly I never realized how
they all kind of fit together

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:10%

basically the same story.

>>The Hero's Journey
is a pattern.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:10%
You can almost think
of it as an algorithm

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:10%
that has three basic parts--
separation, initiation,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:10%
and return.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Separation-- you are in
one kind of a reality,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:90%
in one kind of a place.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:90%
You are separated from it.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Initiation-- you're put
into another place where you

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.480 align:middle line:90%
are in some manner initiated.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.282 align:middle line:90%
Return-- you come back.

That is to bring that
back to the community.

because they're all in here,
because they're all in here.

00:07:57.785 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:90%
This is where they come from.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:10%

the greatest works
of philosophy,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:10%

You first see Dorothy in
her natural environment.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:10%
And just like out
here in regular life,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.889 align:middle line:10%
a person is operating in their

and living in their house
and that kind of thing.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:10%
And then something happens
to shake that world up.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:10%

Carl Jung called
these archetypes.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Archetypes are primordial,
encapsulated stories,

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%

they are in the form

When you plant that
seed in consciousness,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that archetypal seed,
that mythical journey,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:90%
then that seed starts to sprout.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And as it sprouts,
the patterning forces

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
create the situation,
circumstances, events,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and relationships for the
unfolding of the story.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>It's better to have
a story to look through

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:90%
at life than an explanation.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that is
the story is richer.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%

circumstances, coincidences,
synchronicities, relationships

Picks the tiger cub up by

over to a pond,

Well, the universe
just upended you.

The first one is danger.

And second one immediately
is opportunity.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So crisis is both
danger and opportunity.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:10%
>>This idea that if
one storyline collapses

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.996 align:middle line:10%

00:27:30.996 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:10%
and never was true

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%

00:27:37.546 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
reveals something

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.878 align:middle line:84%
to them about themselves
that they didn't know.

00:27:40.878 --> 00:27:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And that became the
new journey they took.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:10%
Because if the camera had

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:10%
I was 24 years old,
what it would have seen

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.204 align:middle line:10%
was a person who
weighed 320 pounds.

00:27:55.204 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:84%
You would have seen me
puffing on two or three

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:84%
packs of Marlboros a day,
a relationship that I

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be in,
and I had a job I hated.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything was wrong in my life.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%

a relationship you don't want
to be in, a body you don't like,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're addicted
to a bunch of things,

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:84%
you're ripe for a sledgehammer
blow from the universe.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And I got it.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>You step over a threshold,

stepped on the ice on the road.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And my feet shot
out from under me,

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and I smacked the back of my
head on the frozen ground.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And it knocked me
out just enough.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't completely
unconscious, but I had a vision

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:90%
while I was semi-knocked out.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I could see down through
all the layers of myself

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to this pure
consciousness inside.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I could see how all the
fat I had was organized around

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:84%
a whole bunch of feelings I
didn't want to let myself feel,

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
like sadness from childhood and
a lot of old grief in my family

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and anger and things like that.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
the fat was there

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to keep me from
feeling those feelings.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And so as I began to come
back to normal consciousness,

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I made a vow that I was going to
change my life so that I could

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:84%
live in that state
of pure consciousness

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
instead of having to have
all of that armor around me.

hearing the call

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and being willing to
take on the challenges

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:84%
of that new awakened
life, once you

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:84%
do that, you begin
to feel a power.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like nothing else
I've ever experienced.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
you can either surrender to
victimhood, and a lot of people

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
do, or you can surrender
to a fundamentalism.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:84%
You can basically give your
responsibility to someone else

it comes from the Upanishads.

Cit, and Ananda.

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:36.020 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote a screenplay.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.090 align:middle line:84%

And some other agent wandered

and said, oh, this is good.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.910 align:middle line:84%

went, oh, shit.

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:52.160 align:middle line:90%
And he ran to his boss.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.576 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
should read this,

00:50:53.576 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:84%
because that guy over there,
who is a junior agent liked it,

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:01.560 align:middle line:84%

and then I got a phone call.

We're literally

One of the biggest inhibitors

or what we did or what we said.

It moves through

It starts to toxify
your perceptions.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.280 align:middle line:90%

great truth in that.

wanted to do full loop ramp.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And I had this idea.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was
physically possible.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you do it
with Hot Wheels.

01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with
a skateboard, right?

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.825 align:middle line:84%
And so I presented the idea
to my sponsor at the time,

01:01:59.825 --> 01:02:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and I said, hey, I
think I can do this.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that
sounds awesome.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's build a ramp.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And I designed the ramp.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And all this was on
paper, and it was my idea.

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget
driving up and seeing it,

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and this wave of fear
just crashed over me,

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.350 align:middle line:90%
like oh, my-- what did I--?

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Are you serious?

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Like I made a loop?

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm really going to--?

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the only one that's
even volunteering to do it.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I felt like
there was so much at stake

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:25.820 align:middle line:90%
to not do it.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Because at the time, no one
was building extravagant ramps.

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:31.220 align:middle line:84%
No one really had money
to do that kind of thing.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And there it was, and I just
had to sort of internalize

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, you keep telling
yourself this is possible.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.190 align:middle line:90%
This is the time.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.273 align:middle line:90%
We gotta make this happen.

01:02:40.273 --> 01:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And little by little,
I figured it out,

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.276 align:middle line:84%
but I took some heavy,
heavy hits that day.

that we can do on tour
every single night.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But the first time, that
was just frightening.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:03.906 align:middle line:84%
But I had to really step back
and go, OK, you can do this.

>>Fear is a very
interesting thing.

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we need to realize
that fear is an inherent part

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.090 align:middle line:90%
of the human experience.

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%

getting rid of fear.

Where's it going to go?

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.620 align:middle line:90%
There's nowhere for it to go.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The issue is to have
courage, to move forward

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.520 align:middle line:90%
in spite of the fear you feel.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>The courage is
not a lack of fear.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
The courage is dealing
with your fear.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody would ever be
described as courageous who

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.127 align:middle line:90%
didn't confront their own fear.

That's not courage at all.

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just doing
something that you

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:55.920 align:middle line:90%
find relatively unchallenging.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.230 align:middle line:10%
>>Courage is when you know
what to do and you do it.

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And lack of courage is
when you know what to do

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and you don't do it.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%

to get up after you fall

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and try again,
exploring the unknown

01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and trying stuff that
maybe people have thought

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.640 align:middle line:90%
was impossible.

you want to do physically,

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.350 align:middle line:90%
you know you need to train.

Think of it like courage gym.

You've got to consistently
go up your fears

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:34.887 align:middle line:84%
and go one step past
them, one step past them.

01:04:34.887 --> 01:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%

Rather than running away,
we should go closer to it.

Because once we can see our
fears, the death of fear

On the one hand, we

in a psychological sense.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%

that we have to slay.

>>What the hero brings
back is a story.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Gilgamesh, for example, the
Gilgamesh epic, he went out

01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and he looked for the
plant of immortality.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.440 align:middle line:84%
He went through all kinds
of trials with the feminine,

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.450 align:middle line:90%
with the monster, and so on.

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But he finally swam to
the bottom of the sea

01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and got the plant
of immortality.

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And he came up on the
shore and put it down.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.120 align:middle line:84%
While he was bathing,
the snake, serpent,

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
came and got the
plant of immortality.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%
But he went home to Uruk anyway.

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:28.990 align:middle line:90%
And he had this story to tell.

01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
For Gilgamesh, there was no
concrete, objective thing,

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
widget to give to the
community, no gold, no treasure,

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:40.420 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The story of getting the
treasure is the treasure.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the giving of the
story is the invitation

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
for other people to
make the same journey.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's a
circle and never ends.

01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>I love that idea
that there's a circle,

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and the circle
needs to be closed.

01:12:57.650 --> 01:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And the way to
close the circle is

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
to come back, return
with something different

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
than you started with
and to share that.

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And that to me is like a
perfect Hero's Journey.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.209 align:middle line:84%
>>That's the ultimate end
to the Hero's Journey's.

01:13:13.209 --> 01:13:14.375 align:middle line:90%
It's not slaying the dragon.

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:16.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not beating the bad guy.

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
It's giving back the
essence of that journey.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.180 align:middle line:90%


01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>What's life about?

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.550 align:middle line:90%
How can I make a difference?

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And who can I make a
difference to and for?

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.290 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets real easy.

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Hey, can I get a shirt?

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, here's a shirt.

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:33.935 align:middle line:90%
Hey, can I get a board?

01:13:33.935 --> 01:13:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here's a board.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my friend's got
an autistic son,

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:39.523 align:middle line:84%
and he's trying to make a movie
and he doesn't have the money.

01:13:39.523 --> 01:13:41.310 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to
finish the movie?

01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, all of a sudden
we're doing things

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.742 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to do anyway,
but then all of a sudden we

01:13:45.742 --> 01:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
can make money for him and
make him finish the movie.

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, it's like, well,

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:49.973 align:middle line:90%
let's do that again.

01:13:49.973 --> 01:13:51.030 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:55.890 align:middle line:90%

in skating that I never

dreamed possible, the
first thing I wanted to do

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:03.042 align:middle line:84%
is try to help kids
get a facility.

01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first thing I did.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I started a foundation
for public skate parks.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
To date, we've helped build
about 500 skate parks.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It's my passion.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%

deserve a chance.

where I went to college.

01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:47.560 align:middle line:84%
If you speak from your heart,
you'll speak to their heart.

But if you speak
through your life,

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and your life is the story,
then you'll change lives.

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
mythical beings do.

01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:00.970 align:middle line:84%

because my story right now,

which is also my truth,
may have an effect on you.

And therefore, I am
taking the internal,

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm making it external,
and through that, I'm

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.680 align:middle line:90%
