00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I probably heard of
it, and it's probably--

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd relate it to
some hippie thing.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.415 align:middle line:84%
>>To me, the
definition of an Indigo

00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:47.755 align:middle line:84%
is someone who's highly
sensitive, with a warrior

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:48.255 align:middle line:90%
personality.

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
A warrior personality
means that someone

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
who's here to lead
and to take charge.

the '70s '80s, clairvoyants

see the color indigo in the bio

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
fields, the auric fields
of mainly children.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Why children?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
vitality of children,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
it's their life
force that renders

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:90%
these colors more visible.

those souls who

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
are identified as Indigos
as having this indigo

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:90%
color in their beingness.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
As I see the soul,
they look like

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:84%
a bright-- a brilliant
star in a midnight sky.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And around the clarity of
that white light that they are

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:90%
is this circle of indigo light.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, it's a
beautiful mythology.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:10%
It's a way to put in words
something that is happening.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:10%
And indigo is a beautiful color.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:90%
But it is just a color.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%

of things, a larger
sense of things.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Indigo children,
to me, are children

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
who have an expanded awareness,
dramatically expand awareness,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
of everything around them,
things seen and unseen.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:10%
>>They have a very
deep spiritual base.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:10%
Not religious base, spiritual.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to them, I don't
care how they have been raised,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
they have a sense of knowing
that there is a greater power,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:90%
there is more than what we see.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>They are also great healers.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
They have the purist
heart that you could find.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I've dealt with a lot
of them, and that's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:90%
what I found them to be.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>For a while I was
kind of confused

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
because I would feel things,
and I would think things

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that I thought no
one else thought.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't always
express myself the way

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I do now, and talk about
things like this openly.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But I'm definitely accepting and
thankful that I am what I am.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Well certainly
Indigos know that they

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
are different from
most other people.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
There are traits that
most, if not all,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Indigos have in common.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:10%
>>These kids were coming
in, or young adults, already

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:10%
questioning what they were
told by their schools,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:10%
or the principal, or
their pediatricians,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:10%
or even sometimes psychiatrists.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:10%
>>They are seen
to be children who

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:10%
are born with
special perception,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:10%
or special wisdom, or
special compassion.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
For me, all children
are Indigo children.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>I wouldn't just want to
be-- like certain people

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
be singled out-- called an
Indigo because everybody is.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
There's just some people have
realized it and some haven't.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Indigo's a name for people
who have realized it, really,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and do special things that
people think are amazing

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
but everybody can do it if they
just believe that they can.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was four I had
many visions of meeting God,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:90%
meeting new people.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:90%
And my inspiration is God.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And the first time that I
drew I thought that everything

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:90%
could do the same thing.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But as I grew a
little older, I knew

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that God gave me this give
to share with others too.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So when I started drawing,
God gave me more ideas

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:90%
that I don't even know.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what the meaning is.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Like the pyramids, I really
don't even know the meaning.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Some paintings are even
more harder and harder

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to think of and
know that meaning.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I started getting
a little older I started

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
knowing that this is
God, this is totally God.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:84%
He's helping me with my art,
he's helping with my poetry,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
my life to live,
other people's life.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
He's taking care of me like
I were a little butterfly

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and he's just a little
human just covering, just

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:90%
making me safe.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:90%
He just-- he's-- I like him.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
He's everything that
I have, and when

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I think of that I feel
like a really good feeling.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
He's in every poem that I write,
in every painting that I paint.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Each time when I paint
the eyes I liked,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I like the eyes
because I like to paint

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:90%
their whole life in their eyes.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes do it with people
even inside their eyes,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.096 align:middle line:90%
little people.

00:08:24.096 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:90%
You don't think.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
dream of something

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
and you just see stuff
inside your dream,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:90%
and you just see it.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's exactly like
writing it and seeing it

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I know with God,
I really know it.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I just feel like
God gave me this gift to me,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:90%
why not others?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Because, sometimes I'm
a little frustrated

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:84%
because I don't get
that right, right thing,

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:84%
like the right word
or the right position.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm frustrated, but when
I just start talking to God

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I just go away and I
start talking to him.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
When I start talking to him he
just calms me down right away.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
He just says that
everything's going to be OK.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when I just
know that feeling

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I just know that it's real.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything is happening,
and other people

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:90%
could have that feeling too.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I started having this feeling
of writing something down

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:84%
about the painting
that I was sketching.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking of something,
but I didn't need to think,

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.825 align:middle line:90%
I was just writing effortlessly.

00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
When I started writing
and I showed it to my mom,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:90%
she's just, why?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Who is this?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:90%
What is these words coming from?

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's from God.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Then I just showed-- I used
to go to school at that time--

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:90%
so I showed it to my art class.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like show and tell.

And all the students is
like this, oh my gosh,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.879 align:middle line:90%
did you write that?

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that everybody
could write the same thing

as I. But when I started
getting a little older

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I understood that
God gave me this gift

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to share with others, to
teach others what he gave me.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:84%
"The day I was
born, I met myself.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The day I was born, I
met my young mother.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
The day I was born, I met
Christ sleeping in my cradle."

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not the Indigo children,
it's not the Crystal children,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.890 align:middle line:84%
or the Rainbow children,
it's the children of today.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
to categorize we

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:84%
are again putting
labels on something.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>We're a society
that loves labels,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and it wants to
compartmentalize.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And humans kind of
do it by nature.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.309 align:middle line:84%
We like to put things
into their place,

00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and have everything have
its little perfect place

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:90%
where it's supposed to be.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the process of
saying that there's

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
a separate phenomenon
of Indigos, Indigo

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
children, or Crystal children,
or whatever it happens to be,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
we forget that every human being
that's brought on this planet

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.569 align:middle line:90%
has a gift.

00:11:49.569 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
They're all gifted,
we're all gifted.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
We all have something
special about us.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>I would try not to use
any terminology whatsoever.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:10%
I would try very, very much
not to do any labeling.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.873 align:middle line:10%
But since this is a world
that uses verbal communication

00:12:05.873 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:10%
I would try to use as
few words as possible.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I would use the one
word, developed.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:84%
They have a development that
is different than other people,

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:90%
other individuals.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Say you're an Indigo, and
somebody comes up to you

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and asks you a question--
Say it's your mom or dad,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:84%
they come up to you, ask you
something, or your friends

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.602 align:middle line:84%
They come up and ask you
something about their life

00:12:38.602 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know about, and
you can tell them what it was

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and how it happened, and
everything like that.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, they just
look at you and say,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
your freaky, or
something like that.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>I honor that there are
children who are very special.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:84%
However, I have not met one
yet that is not or does not

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
have the capability of
becoming very special.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd like to believe that our
whole society, our whole world,

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
is evolving together, some may
be a little faster than others,

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
but hopefully everyone
is evolving together

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:90%
as human beings.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the dangers of
labeling Indigo children as one

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
thing or another is that we'll
start believing the labels,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and we'll sidestep the
authentic experience that's

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:84%
right in front of us, or we will
adjust our experience of what's

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
actually going on
order to fit it

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.735 align:middle line:84%
into our preconceived notion
of what the label suggests

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:90%
it ought to be.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Putting a label, Indigo,
on somebody kind of

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
is almost, or was for me, almost
intimidating to live up to.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.234 align:middle line:84%
Because you hear all this stuff
like, wow, so if I'm Indigo

00:13:53.234 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:84%
does that mean I can never
wake up and have a bad morning?

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I
can never, you know,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.309 align:middle line:90%
never get into a bad mood?

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I think the label might be
a little limiting sometimes.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But once I realized,
wait a second,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
we're just kids who want to
make the world a better place.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>One day we will do
away with the labels

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and we will just
call them children.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%
We will call them humans.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But for now, I think it is
important to have labels

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't label
them other people will.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:90%
They're already being labeled.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
They're being labeled
dyslexic, autistic, disruptive,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
troublesome, ADHD,
ADD, problem children.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
if we don't create

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
a different kind
of label for them

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:90%
then mainstream society will.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.997 align:middle line:84%
>>When Joshua was about
two, or about three,

00:14:54.997 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:84%
we just arrived in
New Zealand, and we

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.836 align:middle line:84%
were on a bit of a
road trip around,

00:14:58.836 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:90%
looking around the country.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:84%
He and I were driving
around one day.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:10%
I think we were looking for
a beach to go skip stones on

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.009 align:middle line:10%
or something.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:10%
We were just quiet.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.867 align:middle line:10%
I was sort of drifting along not
really saying anything, and all

00:15:12.867 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:10%
of a sudden, just out of
the blue, Joshua said,

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:10%
hey dad, who was Michelangelo?

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of thought
about it for a second.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, he was
an artist, buddy.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And he thought about
it for a minute,

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and he said, oh yeah,
oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:90%
He painted the sky, didn't he?

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about
it for a second.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, oh yeah, he did.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
He painted the sky in
big churches and things.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And he said-- I said, why?

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.461 align:middle line:84%
Did you do you know
him or something?

00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
yeah, I knew him.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.335 align:middle line:90%
He was a good man.

00:15:56.335 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, sparked
my interest even more.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, tell
me a little bit more

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:90%
about that Joshua.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, dad, that
was a long, long time ago.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.321 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.321 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was pretty much the
end of that conversation.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>There's always been some
quote "Indigo" children

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, always,
since the beginning of time.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
what's happening now

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
is that there's masses
of children being

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
born who are, in
fact, enlightened.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.495 align:middle line:84%
>>The time the Indigos were
incarnate on the planet

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
in the numbers they
are now was probably

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
in the 12th, 13th
centuries, and they

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
were known at that time as
the Gnostics, as the Cathars,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
as the Bogomils, the
heterodox Christians.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
In other words, the heretics.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Some early examples
are Joan of Arc and also

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Bernadette Soubirous, also
known as Saint Bernadette.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
These we're
strong-willed, very tuned

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.535 align:middle line:84%
in young people who
change the world.

00:17:00.535 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Here you have,
on the one hand,

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:84%
these kids that are
incredibly gifted.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Some were remembering
their lives

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
before they were even born,
before they were even in utero.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
There were so many
stories I was hearing.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
One child who actually told
her mommy that before she

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
was born, before she was
even in her mommy's tummy,

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:90%
she used to watch her mommy.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And she actually
described several things

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that her mother had done
so that her mother knew

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
that she was telling
the truth because how

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:90%
could the child know?

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And she was waiting for
the moment to come in.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I chose you.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:90%
I chose to come into your tummy.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>My kids and I were making
valentines for their classroom,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and Maielaya was sitting
on my lap and my two oldest

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
children were at the
kitchen table with us.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And Maielaya was just
looking up into my eyes.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
she noticed her reflection.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And she says, wow mama, I
can see myself in your eyes.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes honey, I
can see myself in your eyes.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, isn't that beautiful?

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:84%
We can see ourselves
in each other.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And she smiled.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
She said, yes, just like
I was grandma Marlene.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I then said, well, tell
me a little bit about that.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
my body got very sick,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I was very, very sick.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and the
doctors tried to help me

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:84%
but my body was way too sick
so, she said, my body died.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and
then my body got

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:90%
colder, and colder, and colder.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And when she said this
there was such an intensity

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:90%
to which she said it.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And her body, my mother's body,
was put on ice for three days.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So then Maielaya says,
and then the two men

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:84%
came to the house,
which two men did,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and she said, and
they put my body

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
into a box, which
they indeed did,

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and then they took my body to
a place that had a big oven.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and
my body was burnt.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and my spirit
went up with the angels.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
She said, but I wasn't
in angel, I just

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
was with the angels watching
you guys, watching all of you,

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I was a baby,
and now I'm Maielaya.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
She seems to be overcome by
the clarity of her experience.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:90%
She then says, I'm scared.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I just know, intuitively,
that I need to sing this song,

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.400 align:middle line:84%
although it's not something
I commonly sing to my kids.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I started singing, "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands."

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And Angelina also joined me.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
words of the song

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Maielaya then grabs
my cheeks, fiercely,

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and looks me right in the eyes
and says, that was the song.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And when she said that I had
instant memory of the song

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
that my mother
actually wrote into her

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
will to be sung on the
boat when we were pouring

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:84%
her ashes into the
Atlantic Ocean.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
She wanted all her
family members,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
all ages, all different
belief systems,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to all have absolute knowing,
as she did, that regardless

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.065 align:middle line:84%
of the outcome of her physical
healing, whether she had it

00:20:21.065 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
or not, that her soul was
infinitely in God's hands,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and she trusted in
that impeccably.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I sang
that song to her she

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
smiled because that truly gave
her comfort in that moment.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84%
That was the song
that was her keynote

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to remind her of her soul
being in God's hands.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>"He's got you
Maielaya in his hands,

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.740 align:middle line:84%
he's got you Maielaya
in his hands,

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:84%
he's got you Maielaya
in his hands,

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:84%
he got the whole
world in his hands"

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>There are some Indigos who
are streaming into the planet

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to bring the sword of
will, the sword of power,

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to cut through the old paradigm
and slice through the illusion.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There are some who are bringing
in the gentle compassion.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:84%
There are some who are bringing
in the new language of light

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and sound.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
the music comes in,

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that's where the heart
communications come in.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And if we can quiet
our minds enough

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
we find that clear
communication can come through

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:90%
on a heart level.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So myself and many
others, I feel,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
are here to bring
the new language,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and we just need the
new ears to hear.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:21:45.130 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I came from kind of a
dysfunctional family.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:84%
My parents got divorced
when I was five years old.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So right away, it
was clear to me

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that the outside
world was not a place

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I could find stability in
or comfort in even at times.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So what that forced me to do,
in a way, was go within myself

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and find that within myself,
and that was my personal path.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
We just need to be able to hold
a space when these kids are

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:84%
telling us, oh, I'm
seeing angels at night,

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:84%
or I'm seeing this,
or this is happening.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And my parents told me,
oh, that's just a dream,

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:90%
your imagination's running wild.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.435 align:middle line:84%
And all those things
would be batted down

00:22:52.435 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
instead of being supported.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.895 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I shut
down, in a way,

00:22:55.895 --> 00:22:57.628 align:middle line:90%
from being able to express that.

00:22:57.628 --> 00:23:01.114 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:23:01.114 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact I just like to ask,
has everyone here heard

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:84%
of Indigo children, and have
an idea in your own minds

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:90%
of what that means?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.570 align:middle line:90%
I've read a little bit about it.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
From what I've observed
from my own little

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
one is being very sensitive,
more than the normal.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Children are sensitive, but
there's an extra edge to it.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
The memory of past lives
bleeds through more readily.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't always
know what to do with it,

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.715 align:middle line:90%
but it's just below the surface.

00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:84%
A knowingness, as all children
do, of what's authentic

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:90%
and what's not.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be more
impatient with that which

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
is not authentic, which
sometimes leads them

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:90%
into clashes.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And helping a master
awaken type of role

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:17.580 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to fill
in the brain education.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>We have to have a
receptivity for it first.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a
receiver like a radio,

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.144 align:middle line:84%
like a crystal receiver,
inside of ourselves.

00:24:24.144 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And that comes
with doing the work

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and clearing out the darkness
and the old patterns of doubt,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and fear, and all
of the old patterns

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:90%
that we've been installed with.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Once we get our receiver
uncovered though,

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:84%
we can tune that dial in
to the indigo vibration.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
incredible process

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to see this happening
all over the planet

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
in these little pockets,
but more and more it's

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:90%
becoming a web.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:24:54.550 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.796 align:middle line:90%
Why are Indigos here?

00:25:16.796 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Indigos are here to
bridge heaven and earth.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.800 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Indigo children have access
to human experience at a larger

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.792 align:middle line:84%
level, at a greater depth
than most people do.

00:25:39.792 --> 00:25:43.200 align:middle line:84%
They access the data
in a different way,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the incoming data of
life, and they access data

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%
that some people don't
have access to all.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes
the Indigo children

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
are mistaken or
misunderstood to be

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
children with attention
deficit disorder,

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:84%
or children with
some sort of deficit

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:90%
of some kind or another.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.406 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it isn't
that they have a deficit

00:26:00.406 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:90%
but they have a supplement.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:90%
They have more not less.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>If we have our Indigo children
mask their spiritual gifts

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:84%
with substances like
Ritalin, or fast food that's

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:84%
being sold on school
campuses for lunch,

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
then we are literally
shackling these children,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
we're putting them into
chemical straitjackets.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>When you're trying to put
them in a curriculum in a school

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:84%
system where they have to learn
a little bit about everything,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.846 align:middle line:84%
kind of in a spiral,
as they're growing,

00:26:30.846 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't work
for them because they

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
want to take a
subject, grab onto it,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:84%
sink their teeth in and go until
they've gotten to a point where

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:84%
they're finished
with that subject.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Then they come back
and grab another one.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of these
kids really need

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:84%
to be in private
school or home tutored.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:53.704 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, when you're
in groups of 20, 30, 40 kids

00:26:53.704 --> 00:26:54.495 align:middle line:90%
you have to behave.

00:26:54.495 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to sit there
for an hour or 45 minutes, 55

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:90%
minutes.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And for many of them that's
just asking too much.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>In my life, I've
been diagnosed

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:84%
bipolar, manic depressive,
schizophrenic, psychotic,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
but I have one doctor who, after
I had my quote "breakdown,"

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:84%
tried to jump off some buildings
and whatnot, he said to me,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Miss Kirkland, they're going
to probably tell you never

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:84%
to be an actress
again, that you're

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
too emotional, you're too
this, you're too that.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%
He said, don't listen to them.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, in Asia,
in my country, you

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.580 align:middle line:90%
would be considered an artist.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
But in your country
you're labeled.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you're too creative,
you're too artistic,

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.050 align:middle line:90%
you're considered crazy.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>These kids are being,
if you want to say it,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:90%
tripped into this hyperactivity.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
getting junk food,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:84%
they're getting-- often,
they're precipitated by having

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
mercury in their
environment, mercury in fish,

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:90%
mercury from co-gen plants.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of the older ones have
had it filled into their teeth.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And then also, there is the
fact that the younger ones are

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
getting it actually
through vaccinations.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these young children
will be quite normal, well,

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
what we call normal,
until they're

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.940 align:middle line:84%
tripped into having
vaccinations,

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
repeated vaccinations
throughout childhood,

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:84%
with thimerosol, which is a
mercury-based preservative.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>I can't imagine any kind
of artificial substance,

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.787 align:middle line:84%
or pharmaceutical,
or drug that you

00:28:29.787 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:84%
could put into the body of a
child that could substitute

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
for, or provide you with more
profound or deeper impact

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:84%
than love, caring,
compassion, and acceptance.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of Indigos
are labeled ADHD,

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:84%
which the medical
community will tell

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
you stands for Attention Deficit
with Hyperactivity Disorder.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think that ADHD
stands for attention

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.065 align:middle line:90%
dialed into a higher dimension.

to talk about today

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
is an osteopathic
approach to children

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.050 align:middle line:90%
with ADD, ADHD, and autism.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We're really going to talk about
individual care a little bit,

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and about the full
spectrum of options.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We have things all
the way from dealing

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.985 align:middle line:84%
with just drugging them and
using Ritalin, or Adderall,

00:29:14.985 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
or any of the other
medications that are out there.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
We have the choices of
doing absolutely nothing

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and using alternative
medicine, whether it

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:84%
happens to be herbs
or homeopathy.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.894 align:middle line:84%
You have the full
spectrum, and even

00:29:26.894 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
osteopathic
manipulative medicine,

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.601 align:middle line:84%
because it definitely makes
a difference in these kids.

00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So do we say that we have to be
on one spectrum or the other,

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
or do we have the
benefit of being

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.320 align:middle line:84%
able to use a full spectrum of
things that are available to us

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.150 align:middle line:84%
as what's appropriate for
that individual child.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Being different's
not a bad thing.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just different.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing
is finding people

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:52.200 align:middle line:84%
who understand you, who respect
you, and allow you to be you,

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.997 align:middle line:84%
to be the individual
that you are.

00:29:53.997 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the most important thing.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing
you may not always

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:84%
be the popular kid, or the one
that everybody gets along with,

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.370 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:90%
What is normal?

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:84%
That is one of those words
where we use it so often.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:90%
What is normal?

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's different from
every physician you talk to,

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.560 align:middle line:84%
every parent you talk to,
every individual you talk to.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have a hard
time when we say,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.226 align:middle line:90%
well, this kid's not normal.

00:30:19.226 --> 00:30:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is your
classification of normal,

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So as we start to approach these
children, the things that I'm

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
finding, universally,
are that they're often

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.514 align:middle line:90%
very, very bright.

00:30:31.514 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Have you guys seen
the same thing?

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:90%

amazing, amazing thing.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That we want to actually
continue to help

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.170 align:middle line:84%
promote these kids
in feeling that it's

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
OK to feel maybe that
they are special.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:90%
I think everybody's special.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you recognize that
whatever their special thing

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:84%
is, to help them further it
so that they have a chance

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
to blossom and become the
most amazing individual, most

Then fine, use the label Indigo.

Makes no difference to me.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But recognize that
every child needs

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to have that love
and that compassion,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that patience to
help them really

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.366 align:middle line:84%

the country sending in data,

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:10%
the incidence of
autism has risen 800%.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And every year it's raising
about an average of 20%.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%

in communication abilities.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Many of them seem to
communicate mind-to-mind,

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:84%

calls telepathically,

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:90%
with their parents.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
seem like it causes

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:84%
a problem until later on in
life when the parent feels

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
embarrassed that in
social situations

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
the child's not speaking

So the diagnosis that these
young, highly sensitive

autism or, in some cases,

Asperger's syndrome.

But the weird part was
it wasn't like when

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.236 align:middle line:84%
you think the thought,
no, to yourself

00:36:56.236 --> 00:36:57.610 align:middle line:84%
or, no, I'm not
going to do that.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that at all.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Not only was it a voice,
but it was a voice

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that I recognized as
Dar's, which is believable

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.860 align:middle line:84%
because I had heard
him speak occasionally.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.734 align:middle line:84%
So every once in a while, Dar
would say something, really,

00:37:09.734 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:90%
out of his lips.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a while
he'd go, I'll take that,

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:12.456 align:middle line:90%
or I'll do that.

00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So I knew his voice when
he would speak normally,

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and then he'd revert to
these um sounds and stuff.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I heard this no in my
head, and I look over at him.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking at me and he
goes, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And he'd never done that.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my gosh,
this kids' reading my mind.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.530 align:middle line:90%

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.140 align:middle line:84%
difficult to deal
with, then we're

going to treat it one way.

that we can't access

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:84%

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.696 align:middle line:90%

I mean, if it gets

Drugs, alcohol are ways that
they use to self-medicate.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So the parent must learn how to
communicate, and also make sure

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that they have taken
enough training to know

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:57.640 align:middle line:90%
how to communicate well.

>>It's really OK as a parent
to not know the answer.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's really OK to say,
hey, I really love my kids,

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.050 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to have
a different life.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Or it's really OK to say,
my child's pretty strange

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
what to do with that.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:90%
All of that's OK.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be
something afterwards

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be
nurturing to your child.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think then the next
step is to say, I don't know

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to find out.

>>If there was one gift that a
parent could give a child that

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.780 align:middle line:84%
would have lasting value and
lifelong effect and impact,

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be
the parent's presence.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.019 align:middle line:84%
And by that I don't mean
the number of hours,

00:39:43.019 --> 00:39:45.060 align:middle line:84%
or the number of days each
week that you're there

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
with your child, but
that when you are there

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.450 align:middle line:84%
with your child, if it's only
for 10 or 15 or 20 minutes

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:54.790 align:middle line:84%
you are completely, totally,
and utterly present and open

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.090 align:middle line:84%
to the authentic
experience of that moment.

>>If you don't start
with you, you're

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.080 align:middle line:84%
just going to pass this
problem down to your child.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to find a way
to get rid of all that out you

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
so that when you look at
your child you see gorgeous.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
of ways to do that.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:84%
You can do it through
books, and meditation.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you have
to say, every time I

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.190 align:middle line:84%
feel like my child is a
problem, I have to go to me

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and say, why do I see that
as a problem, and fix that.

>>That the soul of this
child is wise and mature,

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.760 align:middle line:90%
sometimes even beyond yours.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, this
mature and wise soul,

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and very capable soul, is trying
to incarnate into this child

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.130 align:middle line:90%
body-mind.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So don't forget that the
child has to be raised,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.645 align:middle line:84%
and the great soul
has to be respected.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:84%
were extremely different than

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:90%
listened to my gut.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I channeled their
talent from a very young age

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%

really good grades,

perform all the time,

you are true to yourself then

you can be true other

No.

You want to be fun
and upbeat, and do

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.230 align:middle line:84%
things you'd never
do because you never

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.310 align:middle line:84%
know when it's going
to be your last day.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:01.540 align:middle line:90%
"--my last breath.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And I love as if my heart won't
break, and dance as though I'm

by myself." [SLAPPING HER THIGH]

what you think,

I am going to live for me.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And that won't ever change.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Today could be my last day."

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:33.610 align:middle line:84%

bombarded with just stuff

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that they don't even need
to see, or hear, or feel.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I think things are so upside
down, at least in this country,

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.720 align:middle line:84%
where we're at, with
what we're teaching them.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
into a public school

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and teach somebody lies about a
fictional character in history,

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
going to teach them

00:46:55.550 --> 00:47:00.670 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with crisis
in their life, mentally,

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.690 align:middle line:84%
or teach them how
to eat correctly,

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.460 align:middle line:84%
organically, or teach
them how to farm,

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.490 align:middle line:84%
or teach them about
meditation and slowing down

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:12.780 align:middle line:90%
their heart rate in a struggle.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.150 align:middle line:90%
What's up with school?

not put in the amount of money

to be there to really,
financially support

all the educators and
the school systems,

and all these phenomenal

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:38.880 align:middle line:84%
working in this system
that's just failing.

>>My book "Fear Now" is now
the rage in high schools.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's certainly some mark.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.960 align:middle line:90%
It tickles their consciousness.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>What schools need to do
is not concern themselves so

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:84%
much with memorization
of data but with pulling

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:16.590 align:middle line:84%
from the inside of the
child the wisdom that

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:90%
resides there quite naturally.

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>According to the
definition, and if we

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.110 align:middle line:84%
look at the definition
of education coming

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.850 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek
definition of edukas,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:34.330 align:middle line:84%
it is the pulling forward
of wisdom from within.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>No Child Left Behind
is really scary to me

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:43.590 align:middle line:84%
because what it's doing is
instead of teaching them

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:49.270 align:middle line:84%
how to think it's teaching
them what to think.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get back
to what true teaching is.

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>We haven't
evolved as a country

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.090 align:middle line:90%
in what we're teaching them.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.425 align:middle line:84%
We haven't adapted
to where they're at.

00:49:02.425 --> 00:49:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
just way ahead.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.360 align:middle line:90%
They're needing more.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's here
already, we have it.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.580 align:middle line:90%
The people here.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.550 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be
allowed to be taught.

>>With all of your might, man,
throw up your fists there,

Expand the family through

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.220 align:middle line:84%
With all of your might, man,
through up your fists there,

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.290 align:middle line:84%
run out on the front line,
fight for the children.

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.120 align:middle line:84%
No better time than now
to build this energy.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Expand the family through
synergy chemistry.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>The educational
paradigm is shifting,

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and that there needs
to be something

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:48.260 align:middle line:84%
for the children of today
so that they can feel

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.100 align:middle line:84%
nurtured in a safe and
sacred environment for them

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to be fully and
completely who they are.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:50:00.590 align:middle line:84%
We've developed a prototype for
a new type of schooling system

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:84%
that's really an entertainment
and an educational learning

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.820 align:middle line:90%
center within the community.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is a place that is
completely child-directed.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.650 align:middle line:90%
We have all ages together.

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's
really a iteration

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:21.300 align:middle line:84%
of the one-room schoolhouse in
a hip, jazzed up environment,

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.800 align:middle line:84%
in a manner that allows
us to keep authenticity

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:90%
to our vision.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>True teaching is
helping to bring out

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.720 align:middle line:84%
the gifts that each of
these children have,

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and also having them recognize
that there are gifts and not

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:90%
all gifts are the same.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:52.640 align:middle line:90%


00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HSP stands for a Heightened
Sensory Perception.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we could increase
our senses, our perceiving

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of our senses, we can make
decisions that we're proud of,

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:05.500 align:middle line:90%
we can feel more confidence.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
leads to a much healthier

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.120 align:middle line:90%
and more peaceful outlook.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lee really wanted
to prove his theory

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:19.600 align:middle line:84%
that with some training all
children can develop their HSP

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.810 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, with an initial
group of children,

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.920 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit
of training, it

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.910 align:middle line:84%
was shown that prior
to the training

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:31.680 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have any
extraordinary abilities.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.510 align:middle line:90%
They hadn't used them yet.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But with a little
bit of training

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:38.620 align:middle line:84%
they developed some
really remarkable results.

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Some of the HSP
testing and training

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.800 align:middle line:84%
that the students got a
chance to participate with

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.610 align:middle line:84%
included being
blindfolded and learning

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to recognize colors, and
shapes, and even words.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Other students had
the opportunity

00:51:54.070 --> 00:52:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to bend spoons and actually have
spoons attach to their bodies

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.990 align:middle line:90%
just by using their brain power.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Initially, these students
couldn't do these tasks.

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But with the training, in
which they had so much fun,

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:12.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
laughter and joy,

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:16.060 align:middle line:84%
the students developed a
sense of I can do it spirit.

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, at
the end, more than 25%

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.080 align:middle line:84%
percent of students successfully
could be blindfolded

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and to make out images
and pictures and colors.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.050 align:middle line:84%
33% of students, or
more, experienced success

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:31.840 align:middle line:90%
using the spoons.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Later, another training
was done in Ashland, Oregon,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:84%
in the United
States, which helped

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.910 align:middle line:84%
to confirm those
original findings.

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And with a group of
44 American children,

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:04.760 align:middle line:84%
again, with no special
initial abilities or ideas,

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.240 align:middle line:84%
they were able to do some
very remarkable things using

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.130 align:middle line:84%
their brain and
using their choice.

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:19.410 align:middle line:10%
>>Step one of saving the world
begins in our daily lives.

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:20.715 align:middle line:10%
First thing to do is be happy.

00:53:20.715 --> 00:53:22.470 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the most
important things.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:10%
It's scientifically proven to
be healthy, and it's contagious.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:33.240 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:37.160 align:middle line:10%
So if you're happy, and
you're in a public area, and--

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.120 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.080 align:middle line:10%
You get my meaning, don't you?

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.350 align:middle line:10%
I would consider myself
to be a peacemaker.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:48.772 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that I've got a
lot of ideas in my head

00:53:48.772 --> 00:53:50.230 align:middle line:84%
about peace that
I think, sometimes

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they're
almost common sense to me,

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.110 align:middle line:84%
but might not be to
the rest of the world.

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:58.800 align:middle line:84%
As far as our Western
civilization goes,

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.740 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we have been
thinking about ourselves

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and what we're doing right now.

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I know that the Native American
tribes, way back when, were

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:11.120 align:middle line:84%
into this action affects
the next seven generations,

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and we need to watch
what would happen

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:16.650 align:middle line:90%
if we do carry out this action.

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So they had it right.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.350 align:middle line:84%
We just need to figure out what
they were talking about now.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:22.670 align:middle line:84%
If I get to say one thing
to the leaders of the world

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:24.840 align:middle line:84%
it would be that
we're all working

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.870 align:middle line:84%
towards one goal,
which is peace.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.890 align:middle line:84%
There's no people
who are working

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:32.140 align:middle line:84%
against peace in the
world, I believe.

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Stand up for what
you believe in.

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes. [APPLAUSE]

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:43.035 align:middle line:84%
>>We all have-- we
all know what we

need to do to save
the world, really.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.380 align:middle line:84%
We all have our own
special calling.

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.525 align:middle line:10%
We know what the
politicians need to do.

00:54:48.525 --> 00:54:51.780 align:middle line:10%
And unfortunately,
sometimes the politicians

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.652 align:middle line:10%
don't seem to know what
we want them to do.

00:54:54.652 --> 00:54:56.910 align:middle line:10%
That's because we're not
getting it out there.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:00.204 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
you know, I've always

00:55:00.204 --> 00:55:01.870 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do something
to save the world

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.810 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't think
of anything to do up

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:06.106 align:middle line:90%
until that point, really.

00:55:06.106 --> 00:55:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't think,
so what could I

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.790 align:middle line:84%
do beside the idea to
write the pamphlet, which

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:12.300 align:middle line:84%
had led to the idea
that, wait a second,

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe other people
have that problem.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They want to do
something good, they

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.290 align:middle line:90%
can't figure out what to do.

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:20.146 align:middle line:84%
In my booklet I suggested
trying to pick up

00:55:20.146 --> 00:55:22.040 align:middle line:90%
one piece of trash a day.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about that, there's

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:25.800 align:middle line:84%
plenty of trash in the
world, but there's also

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.930 align:middle line:84%
300-something million
people in the US alone.

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if we all picked
up one piece of trash.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.430 align:middle line:84%
You think, one bag, what
difference does it make.

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:38.910 align:middle line:84%
300 million bags makes
a big difference.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:44.990 align:middle line:84%
An Indigo child is really
hard to define because there's

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:47.600 align:middle line:90%
no really definite definition.

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But in a phrase,
I think it would

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:84%
be somebody who has
ideas about how they

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.870 align:middle line:84%
can make the world
a better place.

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:middle line:84%
If they were to say, oh,
you're naive, you're a child,

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.830 align:middle line:90%
I'd say exactly.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm a child, which
is why I'm not

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:11.707 align:middle line:84%
burdened with the sense of
oh well, the world's screwed.

00:56:11.707 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:90%
No, the world's not screwed.

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.600 align:middle line:90%
We can turn it around.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.644 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
get to work on it.

00:56:16.644 --> 00:56:18.310 align:middle line:84%
If each single person
in the whole world

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:21.400 align:middle line:84%
thinks, oh, one person can't
change it, nothing happens.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.020 align:middle line:84%
If each person thinks, well,
if one person can't change

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.320 align:middle line:84%
the world, but one person
can do a little bit.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Each person, that's a
little bit, and it adds up,

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.227 align:middle line:90%
and we've got the golden idea.

00:56:30.227 --> 00:56:31.893 align:middle line:84%
[MUSIC - "BLESSED ARE THE
 PEACEMAKERS"]

00:56:31.893 --> 00:57:05.829 align:middle line:90%


00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>We're looking at
this piece of rock

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:12.620 align:middle line:84%
here, with what they
called a prophecy rock.

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was put here
by one of our clan uncles

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:17.680 align:middle line:90%
from way back.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly how
old this thing is here,

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.940 align:middle line:84%
but it tells us the
migration, how we came up

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.360 align:middle line:90%
from direction south, I call it.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.110 align:middle line:90%
This is Masauwu.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:33.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the person,
or the spirit

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:40.450 align:middle line:84%
being that we made the covenant
to to live the way he lived

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:43.740 align:middle line:84%
his life and to take
care of the earth.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It probably ended here
but then, of course,

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.830 align:middle line:84%
he has to have to his travel
feather for a good journey.

00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he's got
the real long hand here.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The shield here is
indicating that we

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.990 align:middle line:90%
should be cautious of this here.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:03.090 align:middle line:90%
This is the cross.

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:06.380 align:middle line:84%
They already knew that
somewhere along the line

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.470 align:middle line:84%
this was going to be
a part of our life.

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:19.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a cross, and that
represents the other religion.

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:22.520 align:middle line:90%
So, that's the Hopi religion.

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:27.050 align:middle line:84%
We are not to deviate from
that, but as we go up,

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:30.950 align:middle line:84%
this is the new
life on this earth.

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's all squared off.

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:35.820 align:middle line:90%
It was a good life.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But here, some people
chose to go in this line,

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and this is represented
by these people here.

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:53.210 align:middle line:84%
There's four of them, the magic
number for the Hopi people.

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:56.400 align:middle line:90%
This was a semi-good life here.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It's still in line with
a straight line here.

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:01.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:05.170 align:middle line:84%
These are the people
that have supposedly

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:08.650 align:middle line:90%
taken up with that region.

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:09.630 align:middle line:90%
So they're up here.

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And those of us that
maintained-- the ones that

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.410 align:middle line:84%
are maintaining our
cultural activities,

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:18.380 align:middle line:84%
this is their
representatives here,

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the horn of plenty, and
then the forever life.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Here's another figure here,
and he's going to go continue.

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But for these people
here, after this good life

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:38.460 align:middle line:84%
here-- I don't know how far
along we are, but I think

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.880 align:middle line:84%
we're getting pretty
close to the end here--

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.370 align:middle line:84%
they'll go for a
little ways and then

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:46.000 align:middle line:90%
you'll start to be uncertain.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.850 align:middle line:90%
They'll start to waiver.

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:54.650 align:middle line:84%
They'll realize that maybe
that wasn't the right path

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:56.550 align:middle line:90%
to choose.

00:59:56.550 --> 01:00:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So their walk of life will end
before forever, way before.

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is what this
whole thing is telling us,

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:middle line:84%
that this is the way we should
be to follow that covenant.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Indigos in the
native community

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.650 align:middle line:90%
is very much a phenomenon.

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But because of the history of
what the white people have done

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:32.260 align:middle line:84%
with special Native
American children, generally

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
what happened was that if
a Native American child was

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:40.210 align:middle line:84%
deemed as being
special, that child

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
was then taken away
from the parents

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.590 align:middle line:90%
and then put in white schools.

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So there are definitely Indigos
among the Native Americans.

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:56.860 align:middle line:10%
>>The children of our culture,
as well as other children

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.050 align:middle line:10%
in the world, are
very important to us

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:04.150 align:middle line:10%
because I see a lot of the
children that are very smart,

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:10.430 align:middle line:10%
and the children are wanting
attention, they want to learn.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And the children
all over the world

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
are teaching our generation
and the generation

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
before me the importance
of why they are here.

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And we need to listen
to the children.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>If we don't
begin to heal there

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be no
future for our children.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
has been foretold

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to us by our
ancestors, our elders,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that if we don't
wake up and start

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to work among ourselves
in a harmonious way

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that our life as Hopi
will cease to exist.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, our philosophy
that what we do here

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
on Hopi for all mankind, for
all human beings, for all living

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
things, will cease
to exist also.

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's all of us,
not only as parents,

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
but people throughout the
world coming together,

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
unifying, and
bonding together will

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:20.470 align:middle line:90%
make us become balanced again.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>We are all human, and we are
all very important, especially

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.530 align:middle line:90%
to mother earth.

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Masauwu is our creator, and
that's who we have, to respect.

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't it will turn
around and probably discipline

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:38.890 align:middle line:90%
us.

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
I say that, you

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
look at all these hurricanes,
earthquakes, especially

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.370 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, my grandfather told me
that if we misuse our mother

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
earth, if we get greedy
using mother earth, then

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
our creator will
come back to try

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
to remind us to not be
greedy of our land, water,

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:09.080 align:middle line:90%
whatever it may be.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, in our
Hopi culture, prophecy

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
says that we're going to live
in what they call koyaanisqatsi,

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and that means a crazy
world, or craziness.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>And right now, the
world is so out of balance

01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that it is very hard,
as a parent myself,

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to try to instill
that within my kids

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
because, right here on Hopi,
we're so out of balance

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.260 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a sickness that we
need to wake up from.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>I know that
people say that when

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to teach
kids, [SPEAKING HOPI].

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
They say that statement
that means oh well.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But we can't say,
oh well, you know,

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:56.280 align:middle line:90%
because there is still hope.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.600 align:middle line:90%
We can change it.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to change it as
a people, as a whole.

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The people need to
come back to how

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:08.170 align:middle line:90%
we are supposed to be as Hopis.

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:11.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I see.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that the kids
really do want that.

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The really do want to know
who they are as Hopi kids.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>When we're guiding them to
be the leaders of tomorrow

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:21.950 align:middle line:90%
we need to give them the truth.

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
We cannot make stories about
what their life should be,

01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:27.660 align:middle line:90%
but give them everything.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Give them the truth.

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
The prophecies tell us that we
need to look at our children

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
because they will be the
future leaders of our groups,

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
our tribes, our communities.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And we need to give them
up so that they will--

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:51.320 align:middle line:84%
we need to guide them through
they're younger lives,

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
give them the best
advice we can give them,

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
so that they in turn,
when it's their time,

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
can be our leaders
in the future.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.680 align:middle line:90%

>>The children that
are coming in today

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
seem to have more software
already downloaded

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.230 align:middle line:90%
into their systems.

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.730 align:middle line:90%
They are an evolutionary leap.

They are showing us where
we are going as a species.

01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
these children come

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
in with more neural
pathways connected,

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
more abilities, abilities
that we all have

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:31.670 align:middle line:84%

evolution happening?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you have any belief in
natural history and the Darwin

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.280 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon then you have to say
that evolution has to happen,

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.510 align:middle line:90%
it does happen.

01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
We're just so used to
it happening so slowly

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
that we don't get to
really recognize it.

>>Those of us that made a
big investment in the culture

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and tried to shift
consciousness,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
we want the children
to be that way.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Want.

01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, our
actions aren't justified.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>We are in the midst of
an unprecedented, huge

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:33.280 align:middle line:84%
transformation in
human consciousness.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And this transformation
in human consciousness

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:39.140 align:middle line:84%
is reshaping the
human experience.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It is reshaping it for
millions of individuals.

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And within, in my opinion,
just a few generations

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
it will have
reshaped the entirety

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.260 align:middle line:90%
of the human experience.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it is
creating children who

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
are being born with this
new expanded perception,

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and it is expanding the
perception of those of us

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
who are already walking
up on this earth.

name we really want to,

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
but it is a phenomenon that
is real, it is happening,

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and I really believe that is
because technology and science

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:32.935 align:middle line:90%
are changing very fast.
