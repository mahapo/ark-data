NARRATOR: I bow to the
mothers of Bhakti, the saints

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:84%
of mystic yoga, who blew
the seeds of divine love

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
into the hearts of women
all over the world.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I bow to those saints who
struggled and sacrificed

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and paved the way for all
women to attain pure devotion.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of them will
never be known.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
This is a tribute to them,
the unsung heroines of Bhakti.

We are here to serve

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
A heart filled with love,
connected with the divine

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:90%
can reach out to everyone.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Divine love is
the greatest love.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%

Bhakti is really an inherit
response of being alive,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:10%
that is a natural flow, that
we can cultivate no matter

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:10%
what background we're
from, no matter what

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:10%
our spiritual orientation is.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:10%
We feel that connection,
that union with ourselves,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:10%

presence, with others.

It doesn't need to be
an Eastern practice.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Practice of Bhakti is the
practice of unconditional love.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:10%
It allows you to realize that
there's beauty and there's joy

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:10%
and there's divinity
in everything

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:10%
if you just look for it.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:10%
For me, Bhakti is the
heart, the core, of who

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:10%
we are as people, as beings.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a piece of
divine in all us.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And we just need to uncover it.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:90%
We just need to remember it.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Once you get on the path,
once you start to realize

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
centered around a divinity,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
you can't run anywhere
except into divinity.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
You can run your eyes closed and
you'll never run off the path.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:10%
Bhakti is energy.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.135 align:middle line:10%
It's the energy of love.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:43.806 align:middle line:10%
And love has its source in God.

00:04:43.806 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:90%
God is love.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Love is God.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You're tapping in to
the greatest reservoir

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:90%
of energy, which is love.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:10%
So with every person,
whether they're rich or poor,

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:10%
whatever color,
nationality they are,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:10%
I strive to remember that
they want to be loved.

SHARON GANNON: You
enter into a mood

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:10%
of receptivity, of surrender.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.795 align:middle line:10%
And you listen for what God
might want to say to you.

00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:10%
You listen for a
message from God.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:10%
To be a woman of Bhakti,
a woman of devotion,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.575 align:middle line:10%
doesn't mean that
you're perfect.

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
But you are in a dialogue,
in a heartfelt dialogue.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Unless you understand
a woman's nature,

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
you can't really
understand Bhakti.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:10%
But it's a female principle.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:10%
And the female principle is
that nourishing principle,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:10%
that giving principal,
that affection principle.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is, in the first
stage of every human

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:90%
being is the mother.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:10%
For those people that grow
up in the Bhakti tradition,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:10%
the mother is probably one
of the most important people.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any good quality that
I have, it came from my mom.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:10%
And so from the time that
we wake up in the morning,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:10%
my mom would wake us
up and you meditate.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's start your day.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And you go through
it from there.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that my
mother was my first guru.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
She put me on the
spiritual path.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:90%
She made things fun for me.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.661 align:middle line:84%
My mother made the practice of
Bhakti, a devotional life, fun

00:06:18.661 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:10%
I think they had a very
happy childhood in Bhakti.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:10%
It was totally--
Bhakti was the thread

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:10%
that ran through their life.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
If you look throughout the
[INAUDIBLE], about the Vedas,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
women are always glorified
as being more devotional,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
thinking less with their head
and more with their heart

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
about their devotion,
more eager to just

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
throw aside rules and just do
what's right from the heart.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Devotion to my yoga
practice, devotion

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to my teachers, devotion to
God, it's devotion to something

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:90%
other than me, me, me, me, me.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.260 align:middle line:90%

You need to make that choice.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm choosing to be a giver.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm choosing to be kinder.

I'm choosing to be more loving.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I feel very, very grateful
that Bhakti yoga is becoming

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
something that is not
strange to Westerners,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.424 align:middle line:90%
but really is a healing path.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:10%
As long as you're living
Bhakti, you give Bhakti.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:10%
So anybody who lives it
with some seriousness

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:10%
and some sincerity,
then they automatically

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:10%
give that to others.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:10%
And in that, and just
doing your path to Bhakti,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:10%
I see others see that.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:10%
And they want to join and do it.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying,
you need to do this,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
they see how happy
it makes all of us,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:90%
how healthy and conscious.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And people want to
be a part of that.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.765 align:middle line:84%
Just like a yoga practice
or a singing practice

00:09:56.765 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
or a instrument practice,
that faith and feeling

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:84%
the unconditional
love from the source,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
like any other practice, the
more we do it, the better at it

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.712 align:middle line:90%
we get.

00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
practice is for.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:10%
That's what having a
daily [INAUDIBLE] is.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:10%
A daily conscious
practice is for me

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:10%
to connect with my heart.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
One major practice I
have is daily meditation.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And I meditate on
the names of God

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
in an ancient
practice called Japa.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Japa beads are used for prayer
and associating with God

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:90%
through his holy names.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:10%
To experience Bhakti,
the most beautiful thing

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:10%
is Japa, because
Japa is something

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:10%
you can use your own body, your
own mind, and your own words,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:10%
and transform them.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.576 align:middle line:84%
You make that connection,
and that conscious connection,

00:10:50.576 --> 00:10:51.275 align:middle line:90%
your foundation.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:54.463 align:middle line:84%
And the whole rest of
the day is different.

00:10:54.463 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And the whole rest of your
lifestyle is different.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And your whole connections
with other people

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
is different, which
makes them connect

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:90%
with others differently.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So that foundation, as little
or as large as it may be,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
can transform innumerable
different ways.

ask to be made an instrument.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:90%
I will beyond the room.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Kirtan is such a specific,
different form of praise.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- it's just-- it
just lights you up, man.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Through sound we can reach
our true-- our true nature.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.800 align:middle line:10%
The mantra, vibration,
and you interact.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:10%
In other words, as you
sing it, then you're

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:10%
gonna be pulled up into a
different energy that basically

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.085 align:middle line:10%
has infinite possibility in it.

00:15:47.085 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Americans
call it therapy.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.024 align:middle line:84%
But it's way beyond
therapy-- way beyond therapy.

00:15:54.024 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
There's living
imprints that happen

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
in the heart and the

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:90%
I'd never experienced that.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to run for my life.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I was like, where's the
plane to leave my life?

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how I
was going to live.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It was devastation
on that level.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would just sing
[INAUDIBLE], you know?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I would just keep
planting that seed.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And I use those words to replace
the other nasty words that were

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:84%
going on in my head, you know,
words of blame or depression

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.580 align:middle line:84%
or other feelings that I
didn't want to cultivate.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:10%
What we do is we
gather together

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:10%
and we chant of
the names of God.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:10%
And in a sense, it's actually
calling out just like you'd

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:10%
call out to a loved one.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:10%
You're saying their
name over and over.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:59.836 align:middle line:10%
If we offer our Kirtanas
to God, then God is pleased.

00:16:59.836 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:10%
But it should be with
love from the heart,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:10%
not only from the tongue.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:10%
TULASI NADIA HARRISON:
Kirtan pierces your heart.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:10%
Kirtan really goes right
into the center and stays.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:10%
And every time you do
Kirtan it builds up.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.954 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually
the love bursts.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
You end up giving
Kirtan to others.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So even when people
come who've never

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
sung before in their lives,
or say you know, I can't sing.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have-- I'm
tone deaf and somebody told

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:84%
me not to sing when I was in the
sixth grade chorus or whatever.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:90%
I say, this is different.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can sing God's name.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.771 align:middle line:84%
But even in ancient
times that, even

00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
in the past few
hundred years in India,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
ladies come together
and do Kirtan.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
They have their ladies'
Kirtan and they come together.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It's said that women
relax by talking.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes men just
keep it all inside.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But when women come
together who are

00:17:55.670 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
longing for deep spirituality,
it can be very, very profound.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:10%
And Bhakti can be
the way and the goal

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:10%
because you don't need
anything more than Bhakti.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not a way to something.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:90%
It can be a goal in itself.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And many devotees have said,
I don't want anything else.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I just want to sing about the
Supreme and be here forever.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that from
that perspective,

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.870 align:middle line:90%
this life is not bondage.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Its freedom.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
This is moksha, to be
singing about the Supreme.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:90%
What more do you want?

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to be in heaven.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be in
any results exalted state.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:84%
When you hear about Bhakti
from the right source,

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:84%
then you get an idea of
the greatness of Bhakti.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is amazing in that
it isn't something-- well,

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:90%

It's over.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.220 align:middle line:84%
The more you hear
about Bhakti, the more

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.098 align:middle line:90%
you want to know about Bhakti.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:10%
One of the interesting
things about Bhakti

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:10%
is that all of the
forms of Ishwar

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:10%
are accompanied by
a female consort.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.165 align:middle line:84%
So Shiva and Parvati,
Lakshmi and Narayana,

00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:90%
and Radha Krishna and Sitaram.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So Godhead, then in

is almost always
conceived of has

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:84%
a complimentary pair, who are
two, but one, at the same time.

On the path of Bhakti there
is the lover and the beloved.

there is no more powerful

So there's this love affair
at the center all existence.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:90%
How beautiful is that?

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Not some kind of
void or nothingness,

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
but a love affair at the
very center of existence.

And we're part of that.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.975 align:middle line:84%

is a certain type

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of love that is only for God, a
selfless love and a whole love

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and a fully-giving yourself
love that's only for God.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And I mistook that love for
being appropriate for men.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of women do this.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:84%
They love so wholly and so
fully, with so much heart,

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:90%
they could even lose themselves.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So I've lost myself
in relationships

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%

that that selfless love is

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:90%
precious and is only for God.
