00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>To enter the Tao and
experience enlightenment is

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:84%
to answer the question,
what was your original face

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:84%
before your mother
and father were born?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.085 align:middle line:90%
What is immortality?

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Is the promise of everlasting
life merely an illusion

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
created to shield you from
the truth about death,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:84%
or is there proof that
immortality is real?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
What secrets are hidden in
spiritual traditions about life

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:90%
after death?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You can achieve
the ultimate dream.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You can unlock the secret
to who you really are.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
You can open the hidden door to
discover the genius within you.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.425 align:middle line:84%
You can achieve
enlightenment and realize

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:90%
your ultimate potential.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.665 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of years,
the spiritual quest

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
of the human race
has been to discover

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
the true self-- the eternal
light of the Kundalini.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.201 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
At last, from the wisdom
of enlightened teachers,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
you will discover
your true nature,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
which is far more powerful
than you have ever imagined.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.950 align:middle line:84%
You will experience
total inner illumination.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:10%
>>The ordinary reality,
every day stuff

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:10%
that we go through,
good, bad or indifferent,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:10%
is of extreme value.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:10%
It's like gold.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:10%
It is jewels.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:10%
But only through
spiritual practice

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:10%
do you develop the sensitivity,
which is actually innate.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like bringing
out the sensitivity

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to know that this moment
is the only moment you're

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
going to get, and it's going
to be wide open, luminous

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and blissful.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:26.404 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:29.922 align:middle line:84%
>>You have the ability to
master spiritual alchemy

00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:31.005 align:middle line:90%
and achieve enlightenment.

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Early historical records show
that man has searched almost

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:84%
endlessly for the
secret of immortality.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.182 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
The first people who studied
the natural world around them

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
became known as alchemists.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
They experimented with
animals, plants and minerals.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Their work and
observations eventually

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
led to the creation
of chemistry, physics

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:90%
and medicine.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Eastern alchemists
searched for immortality

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
through the study of meditation,
yoga and the martial arts.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They believed immortality
could be achieved

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:84%
by recreating conception
within their own bodies

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:90%
through diligent practice.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Many Western alchemists
believed there

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
was a secret formula that could
turn base metals into gold.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
This Philosopher's
Stone was also

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
thought to be an elixir
of immortality that

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
could rejuvenate the body.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
They believed if it could
turn a corruptible metal

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to incorruptible gold,
it would certainly

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
be able to transform
human beings

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:90%
from mortals to immortals.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:10%
The goal of the early alchemists
was described in Latin

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:10%
as finding the secret method
to unite the soul, called

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.670 align:middle line:10%
the anima, with the spiritus,
or spirit, within the corpus,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:10%
or physical body.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:10%


00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:10%
This is believed to represent
the original trinity which

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:10%
underlies Christianity,
Buddhism, Darwinism,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:10%
many other ancient
alchemical sciences.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Every human being
has the potential

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
to fully master
spiritual alchemy.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:04.669 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Because if you only learn
the practice that gives you

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
enlightenment, how are you going
to enlighten other people who

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.836 align:middle line:90%
might be different from you?

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>The Kundalini is the
enlightened energy within you,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be awakened.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:40.455 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.455 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
The search that spanned the
centuries and covered the earth

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
eventually centered around inner
alchemy, and the attainment

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of immortality through the
activation of a hidden power

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.655 align:middle line:90%
known as Kundalini.

00:06:52.655 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is a dormant,
enlightened energy

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
which resides within the
lower torso of the human body

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and is activated through
yogic practice or meditation

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and results in enlightenment,
inner illumination

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:90%
and immortality.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of the legendary
figures of antiquity,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
including Buddha and Jesus, were
successful spiritual alchemists

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
who believed in the spark of
light within human beings.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Jesus confirmed this when
he said, "the Kingdom of God

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:90%
is within you."

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
When Buddha spoke of the
middle path to achieve nirvana,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
he may have been describing
the central channel

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
of the body through which
the Kundalini energy travels.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
China, India and Tibet
are all civilizations

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:84%
which are based on the complete
evolution of consciousness

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
being achieved through
a Kundalini activation.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:10%
A Kundalini activation,
particularly

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:10%
if achieved through the
practice of sexual yoga,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:10%
represented the ultimate threat
to the religious establishment

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:10%
because it enabled
the human being

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:10%
to achieve enlightenment
which freed

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:10%
their person from the control
of the religious authority

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:10%
of the time.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:10%
The Philosopher's
Stone was linked

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:10%
with magic and with
early religions,

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:10%
and was greatly
feared by the church

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:10%
because it linked human
sexuality, or sexual yoga,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.035 align:middle line:10%
with higher consciousness
or enlightenment.

00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The basic theory of
the Philosopher's Stone

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
is in the process of being
rediscovered by science

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
because it represents the
reality of the ability

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
of the individual to unite
the energy of the body

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:90%
with the energy of the universe.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:84%
In the hermetic
tradition of alchemy,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
this was called
"squaring the circle."

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>People have
striven for centuries

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to find out about
how to get back

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to their primordial energy.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people have,
of course, clicked

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
into those states,
almost spontaneously,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and have been astonished
at what's possible,

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and then have tried to find
ways to get us all, or least

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
sudden disciples, to move
into those patterns of energy,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
those patterns of
the body-mind complex

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
that are for most people
even hard to conceive of.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>There are descriptions of
the power of the Kundalini

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
experience in the esoteric
teachings of China, India,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.475 align:middle line:84%
Tibet, Egypt, Africa
and the Americas.

00:09:57.475 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
The Kundalini has been
described in the Bible

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
as the solar principal
in man, and is the basis

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
of the secret teachings
of Gnostic Christianity,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:84%
the Kabbalah, and the
hermetic tradition of alchemy.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
In the I Ching, "The
Book of Changes,"

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
the oldest sacred
text of China, it

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:90%
is called the "original spirit."

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
In the east, the Philosopher's
Stone, or Buddha hood,

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
is a complete
Kundalini activation

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
in which the meditator sees
a golden, embryonic version

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of himself at the
time of enlightenment.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:10%
This genetic blueprint,
which is created

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:10%
at the time of a
person's conception,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:10%
is dormant in the lower torso
until it is fully awakened

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:10%
by activating the original chi.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
When you successfully cultivate
the original chi of your body

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and fully open the
energy meridians,

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.045 align:middle line:84%
your own chi unites with
the chi of the universe.

00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you hold the body and spirit
as one, concentrating your chi

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:90%
and becoming pliant?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you become like a newborn
baby, clearing your mind

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:90%
and contemplating the profound?

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you remain unknown?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.665 align:middle line:84%
In understanding all things,
can you remain detached?

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
In Indian yoga
scriptures, the Kundalini

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
was illustrated as a golden
serpent coiled within the body

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to describe the potential power
of its energy and awakening.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent
swallowing its tail

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.865 align:middle line:84%
is the oldest known symbol
of alchemical knowledge.

00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You have the potential
to achieve Buddha hood.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:90%
You can become enlightened.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
You can discover your true power
if you fully open the energy

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:90%
meridians of the body.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:10%
When you see your original
face, when you fully

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:10%
activate the Kundalini
within your body,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:10%
this has been described
as union with God

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:10%
in all the theistic traditions.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
True success in
activating the Kundalini

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
is dependent on
finding the secret

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:84%
of the real spiritual
gold within yourself

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
through meditation and other
mental and physical practices.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini yoga theory
is based on the concept

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
tremendous reservoir

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
of stored energy within the
lower torso of the body.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
When this energy is fully
activated and raised

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the
head, it results

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in enlightenment or immortality,
and this is the most

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:90%
ancient secret of yoga.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:84%
What many alchemists
throughout the world

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
have called the
legendary golden elixir

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
is actually the fully activated
starting point of the body.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
In its most complete form,
it is the realization

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:84%
of Buddhahood, or the
attainment of immortality,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.125 align:middle line:84%
which results in permanent,
deathless consciousness.

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
It is this recreation
of conception

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that has the potential to
transform a normal person

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
into a fully enlightened
being that has transcended

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:90%
birth, death, space and time.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Buddha succeeded in awakening
the Kundalini energy

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:90%
within himself.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, he
saw his original face

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:90%
dissolve into emptiness.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
From this golden vision, he
created the basic philosophy

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual freedom that
has benefited humanity

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.635 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world
for thousands of years.

00:14:33.635 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:90%
The word Buddha means "awake."

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
When asked are you
a man or a god,

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha is said to have
replied, "I am awake."

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Chinese
medical system

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:84%
describes the starting point
of the body as a spark of light

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning of time.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It is midway between your
navel and your spine.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
It exists within
everyone, and is created

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.875 align:middle line:90%
at the time of conception.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
This point of light has been
described as the face of God,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and alchemists called
it "the prima materia,"

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.925 align:middle line:90%
the first matter.

00:15:28.925 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Milarepa has a great line
in one of his teachings.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Milarepa was this Tibetan
master that I wrote

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:90%
my doctoral dissertation about.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:84%
He appeared to me once,
too, by the way, in a dream.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
He says, the best
realization of openness

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:84%
is right in the center of
your body, in the avadhuti,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:90%
in the central channel.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
This means that all of those
energies of the Bindus,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:84%
the elements of consciousness
moving through your body,

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
should move into
that open space.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And what seems to be a confined
place around the heart chakra

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is actually the place where
the whole universe opens out

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:84%
to realization,
to enlightenment.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So all of the
things that we talk

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:84%
about, the Bindus, the
channels, the drops, all

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of stuff,
these esoteric teachings

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
about the subtle
body, you might say

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:84%
are accompanying
subtle body that goes

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:90%
with this gross material body.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Working with those
energies allows

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
you to loosen up the entire
physical, electronic, chemical

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and mental aspects
of the human person.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:90%
This is no joke.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.789 align:middle line:84%
How does a Milarepa become
the model of a civilization?

00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what we've
been talking about here

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
is the fully
awakened, enlightened,

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
the fully realized
Buddha is the model.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And so a person like
Milarepa who did

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
become a fully awakened,
enlightened Buddha,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:84%
was totally available to people
and animals and phenomena

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:90%
That is the ideal.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:90%
That is the archetype.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
That is the model for
whatever you're doing.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So that whatever
you're doing, even

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
if it is building
a principality,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:84%
as in fact Milarepa's
guru, Marpa, did,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:90%
he built himself a principality.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But while he was building
the principality,

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
he developed himself
as a Buddha as well.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And he handed out
to Milarepa who

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
in a different form, in
the form of a hermit,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
in the form of an ascetic,
also manifested the same Buddha

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So that suddenly
becomes the basis out

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of which you can leave
an entire civilization.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is the thing that
I think we're missing.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
We're missing the
civilization that

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
emerges out of the cave where
a person goes to meditate.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Out of the hermitage
where a person

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.521 align:middle line:84%
discovers the fullness
of being itself

00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:16.645 align:middle line:90%
through spiritual practice.

00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:90%
What's the natural state?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
The natural state is
this complete openness

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
so that your mind and body are
completely open to something

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
much greater than what
we are, and yet is not

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:90%
separate from what we are.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things
that goes beyond words.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But once you've seen
it and once you've

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
touched human beings who
live that all the time,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:90%
you'll never forget it.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Am I a man dreaming
I am a butterfly,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.345 align:middle line:10%
or am I a butterfly
dreaming I am a man?

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the most ancient
Tibetan spiritual practices

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:90%
is called Dream Yoga.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Dream Yoga is known to be
one of the primary practices

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
of the legendary
Six Yogas of Naropa.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Imagine as you are watching
right now that you are actually

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.510 align:middle line:90%
dreaming.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
What is it that makes you think
that you are awake right now?

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
How can you be certain
if you are dreaming

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.155 align:middle line:90%
or if you are awake?

00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
What is you learn to
control your own dreams?

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
You can do this
with the practice

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
of Dream Yoga, an
ancient method used

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:90%
by Mahasiddhas and immortals.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.573 align:middle line:84%
Dreams can be so powerful that
they can change the world.

00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Artists, writers,
scientists and inventors

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
have all been
inspired by dreams.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Solutions to complex
problems have

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.635 align:middle line:90%
been made clear within dreams.

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Dreams also occur outside
of three-dimensional space

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and time and can
reveal the future.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Padmasambhava in
8th century Tibet

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
described a dream where he saw
a future time in which the iron

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
bird flies, and
horses run on wheels,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and the Tibetan people were
scattered around the Earth,

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Dharma came to
the land of the red man.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:10%
He was clearly seeing
the world as it

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:10%
became in the 20th century.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of the great
scientific discoveries

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
are the result of
parallel probable versions

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
of the scientists communicating
within dreams according

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:84%
to the mini world's
interpretation of quantum

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.915 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
As you are watching
right now, there

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
are multiple, parallel,
probable and alternate versions

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
of yourself doing the same
thing, simultaneously,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:90%
in multiple dimensions.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:58.625 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.625 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
To control the dreams
while you were dreaming

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:84%
enables you to access creative
information that can completely

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
transform your
experience of reality.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And to have what
is known as elusive

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
dream is to understand
your waking life

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.710 align:middle line:84%
is also a part of your
personal dreamscape.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
During the course of the day,
it is necessary to ask yourself

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.455 align:middle line:90%
repeatedly, is this a dream?

00:22:22.455 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:84%
To discover your true self
while in elusive dream,

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
go to a mirror and embrace
the image of yourself

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.295 align:middle line:90%
that you see there.

00:22:40.295 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Elusive dreaming is a
metaphor for enlightenment.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:10%
To realize you are dreaming
while you are dreaming

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:10%
represents the ability
of each human being

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:10%
to realize that their own
perception is dreamlike,

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:10%
and to achieve greater
and greater levels

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:10%
of awakening through their
own spiritual practices.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary ways of
realizing that you are dreaming

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
while you are dreaming is
to recognize an incongruity

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:90%
within the dream.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
To realize that
you are flying, you

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.910 align:middle line:84%
are walking on water,
that because you

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
are walking through
a wall, that this

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
means that this is a dream
because you could not possibly

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
be doing this in
three-dimensional reality.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
The goal of dream yoga is to
discover who you really are.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So to see a golden embryonic
version of yourself

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
within your dreams through a
complete Kundalini activation

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
represents complete
self-discovery

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and ultimate enlightenment.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.496 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.496 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Now there are certain
prayers and practices

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
also that the Tibetans give for
how to position your body when

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:84%
you sleep so that the channel's
in the proper position,

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:84%
so that you're
breathing properly.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Also, they give a number of
prayers that can be said.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And I say one of these
prayers from time

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
to time about being able
to see dreams as lucid,

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and also to recognize the
awake state as dreamlike

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:35.470 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, because
this way you see

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:90%
through the patterns of energy.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
they're not there,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
it means that you see through
them, you see their qualities

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.645 align:middle line:84%
and the woven quality
of all phenomena.

00:24:47.645 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>It is the dream
of enlightenment

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:84%
which makes achieving
immortality possible.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:84%
The deepest level of our dreams
has always been enlightenment.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>That's a great blessing.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
kinds of things

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:84%
that the Lamas, the
tradition of dream yoga

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
really is a wonderful
gift, because then you

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:84%
can use your nocturnal
experience as part

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:90%
of your practice.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And it goes right
along with what

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I was saying about
everything being an oblation,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:90%
everything being an offering.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if you waste
your valuable sleep time,

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:84%
you're losing several hours
of practice every day.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you turn sleep
into a practice,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
then you're practicing
all the time.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And so your body at
all times is engaged

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of spiritual
activity-- a pretty good thing.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.222 align:middle line:84%
>>To know other is wisdom,
but to master oneself

00:26:04.222 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
is enlightenment.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.545 align:middle line:84%
Those who conquer others
require great strength.

00:26:43.545 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But to conquer oneself
requires true power.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:84%
You can enter the Tao
through the true mastery

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:90%
of martial arts.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:84%
The traditional goal of
higher martial arts in China

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
has always been to
enter the Tao, which

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is the achievement
of enlightenment.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Seeing your original
face was successfully

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:84%
cultivating the spiritual
embryo which transforms you

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:90%
into an immortal.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So traditionally, the
greatest martial artists

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
reached this ultimate
level in which

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
you unite the energy of the
body with the energy of the Tao

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and actually become
a living Buddha.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
The secret of martial arts
is a Kundalini activation

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:84%
which results in the
enlightened warrior seeing

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.073 align:middle line:84%
his original face and
achieving inner illumination.

00:27:43.073 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The master martial
artist actually

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:84%
unites the microcosm of
the body with a macrocosm

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, and
in doing so discovers

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.930 align:middle line:84%
the holographic
nature of reality.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
This process unites the
mind of the individual

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.225 align:middle line:90%
with the universal mind.

00:28:06.225 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:10%
Bodhidharma, the
founder of Zen Buddhism,

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:10%
is the most well known and
respected Buddhist teacher

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:10%
in East Asia.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:84%
In the 5th century, he
traveled from India to China

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:84%
to teach the monks of
the Shaolin temple.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:10%
It was there that he created
Shaolin martial arts,

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:10%
a method of self-defense
which included

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.970 align:middle line:10%
meditation and enlightenment.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Bodhidharma taught there
was no enlightenment

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:84%
outside of the mind,
and that the mind

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:90%
is enlightenment itself.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment is not just
an awakening of the mind,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
it is a physical
process as well.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Many of the greatest
teachers of wisdom

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:84%
have activated the original
mind using the source

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.130 align:middle line:90%
energy of their bodies.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:84%
This experience is called
seeing your original face,

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:84%
or returning the
original spirit to void.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:23.723 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.723 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
The Tao is based on the unity of
the essential triad of heaven,

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:90%
earth and humanity.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.540 align:middle line:84%
The ideal of the
Shaolin temple is

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to enter the way by mastering
meditation and chi cultivation

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:90%
as well as martial arts.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:84%
The creation of Tai Chi is based
on the thousand-year-old story

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
in which the founder
Chang San-Feng observed

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.242 align:middle line:84%
an epic battle between
a crane and a snake.

00:30:05.242 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:10%
He watched intently as the bird
fiercely attacked the snake

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.010 align:middle line:10%
again and again.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
With each attempt of the
bird to kill the snake,

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
the serpent's agility,
yielding and flowing movements

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:90%
enabled it to survive.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
The crane used its
speed and mobility

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to avoid the snake's
counter attacks,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.960 align:middle line:90%
and also remained unharmed.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Chang San-Feng is
also said to have

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.030 align:middle line:84%
had a dream the following
night in which he

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:84%
was visited by the legendary
God of War, Kuan Ti.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:48.255 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.255 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:10%
Kuan Ti taught him the methods
of celestial martial arts

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:10%
and the alchemical secret
of the golden embryo.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Chang San-Feng
combined these lessons

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
with a style of fighting based
on the movements he observed

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.400 align:middle line:90%
of the crane and the snake.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:84%
This method relies
upon internal power,

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:84%
or chi, and is based
on the principal that

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
yielding overcomes aggression,
and softness overpowers

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.240 align:middle line:90%
hardness.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Chang San-Feng called
it Tai Chi Chuan,

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:36.926 align:middle line:90%
or "the supreme, ultimate fist."

00:31:36.926 --> 00:31:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The highest level
of martial arts

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
is based on the
enlightened warrior

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:84%
seeing his original face
and successfully cultivating

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.880 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual embryo.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:84%
This has the potential of
transforming an individual

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:84%
into an immortal,
or a living Buddha.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Many of the greatest
Chinese martial artists

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
actually achieved this
level of enlightenment,

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and use their incredible
skills and power

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to protect and
benefit their people.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.160 align:middle line:84%
A major aspect of
Chinese martial arts

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is the transformation of
your three inner treasures--

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:25.600 align:middle line:84%
jing, chi and chen--
within the body.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Often translated as reproductive
energy, vital bodily energy

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and mind and spirit, they
are the most important aspect

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.730 align:middle line:90%
of internal power development.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Their complete
refinement results

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual embryo and
immortality, a permanent state

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:84%
of enlightened
consciousness that

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:84%
is not limited by the
physical body and even

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:90%
exists after death.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Complete mastery of
the sword has always

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.365 align:middle line:84%
been a metaphor
for enlightenment.

00:32:57.365 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The true sword represents
the enlightened mind.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And the enlightened
mind represents

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
discovering who you truly are
by seeing your original face.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Mastery of the sword
is based on the concept

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:10%
that it is possible
to enter the Tao

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.890 align:middle line:10%
and realize compete inner
illumination by combining

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:10%
meditation and qi cultivation
with a martial arts practice.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:84%
The legendary
alchemist and founder

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:59.225 align:middle line:84%
of Tai Chi, Chang
San-Feng, said the Tao

00:33:59.225 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:90%
is something miraculous.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It is empty and has no
form, yet it has an essence.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It is hard to
understand and exists

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:90%
like a shadow or an echo.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:90%
No one knows why this is.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Great spiritual warriors have
attained the Tao in the past,

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and it is transmitted
in the present

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:90%
by mysterious and subtle ways.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:84%
The great Tao has the
power to transform

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:90%
both the body and the spirit.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:84%
In this way, the
body is transformed,

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:90%
united with spirit.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.654 align:middle line:84%
One who has attained this is
called a spiritual warrior.

00:34:45.654 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
The shen, or spirit, is
fluid and ever-changing

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:84%
though its primal
substance is unchanging.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:08.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Once the warrior
has entered the Tao,

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.170 align:middle line:84%
he no longer fears
birth or death.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.430 align:middle line:84%
In this way, the body is
the same as spirit or shen.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:22.870 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Once revealed, the spirit is
the same as qi, or vital energy.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:84%
This is how the warrior is able
to move through water or fire

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:84%
without being harmed
and to cast no shadow,

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.880 align:middle line:84%
whether in the
sunlight or moonlight.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.520 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
At this point, whether to
remain in the body or not

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.120 align:middle line:90%
is entirely up to you.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.330 align:middle line:84%
At this stage, there
is no difference

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.990 align:middle line:84%
between being in the
world and being out of it.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:36:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.480 align:middle line:84%
If the body, being
material, can achieve

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.510 align:middle line:84%
these levels of subtle
integration, how much more

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
so can the shen, or spirit,
reach even deeper and further.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It is said when the spirit and
body are united they become

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.220 align:middle line:84%
the true body, because when the
body and spirit unite as one

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.030 align:middle line:90%
they live forever.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:84%
However, there are differences
in the depth of power

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.910 align:middle line:90%
the warrior may attain.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:46.140 align:middle line:84%
If his spiritual power
is deep and profound,

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.000 align:middle line:84%
this will affect
his body as well.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
If it is small and shallow,
it only affects the mind.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:10%
One whose body and spirit are
united is an immortal warrior.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:11.780 align:middle line:84%
While one whose mind only is
affected cannot escape death.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
In this way, we see that the
Tao is difficult to master.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But if one can
fully enter the Tao,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:34.620 align:middle line:84%
he achieves what is
called "leaving no body."

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.980 align:middle line:84%
The warrior hides his light and
conceals his brilliance-- this

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:90%
is how one attains the Tao.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:84%
By stabilizing the spirit
and cultivating their chi,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:84%
they study the Tao
without ceasing.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.190 align:middle line:84%
When their spirit
merges with the Tao,

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:55.790 align:middle line:90%
it is called "entering the Tao."

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.230 align:middle line:84%
It is said that those
who enter the Tao

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.983 align:middle line:84%
are themselves
absorbed by the Tao.

00:38:00.983 --> 00:38:07.635 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:10.016 align:middle line:84%
If people will
cultivate the Tao,

00:38:10.016 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:90%
their bodies will be strong.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.260 align:middle line:84%
By cultivating the
Tao for a long time,

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
one can transform
substance to spirit,

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:22.965 align:middle line:84%
refine their body into subtle
energy, and merge with the Tao.

00:38:22.965 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Then their knowledge
is boundless,

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and their physical
body is transcendent.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:30.603 align:middle line:90%
This is the power of the Tao.

00:38:30.603 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Speaking for a moment
from the Tibetan,

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.660 align:middle line:84%
or the tantric
point of view, it's

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:15.280 align:middle line:84%
not enough just to fall in
love, to give yourself to family

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:90%
life, to raise children.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.060 align:middle line:84%
There is another way
of seeing all of that.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Because as we know, family
life, raising children,

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
being responsible
for your family

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.840 align:middle line:90%
can be a tremendous attachment.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And every spiritual tradition
has warnings about sex, family,

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:84%
relatives, money, houses and
all of those other things

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:84%
as becoming obstacles
on the spiritual path.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost as if by claiming
that sexuality in some way

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:52.790 align:middle line:84%
is a way to get enlightenment
is like telling people go down

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that road that's just full
of potholes, and boulders,

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and stray pieces of
metal, and you're

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:middle line:90%
going to attain enlightenment.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of
the tantric system

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
is that it takes life
as it is and sees

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:84%
something sacred,
something wise, something

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:84%
liberating in the
potholes, and the iron

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.930 align:middle line:84%
chunks, and the boulders,
and the broken roads,

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and the earthquakes and
everything else that occur.

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:90%


00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>There is an ancient
tantric saying

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that Buddhahood can be found
in the vagina of a woman.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the oldest methods of
fully activating the Kundalini

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and recreating conception
within the body

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:84%
is through the practice
of sexual yoga.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Many couples in
China, India and Tibet

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.235 align:middle line:84%
have achieved enlightenment
together in this manner.

00:40:55.235 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:90%


00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.440 align:middle line:84%
The central teaching in tantric
yoga is that all of life

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.230 align:middle line:90%
is sacred, especially sexuality.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:84%
This is because tantrism
views the reproductive energy

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.960 align:middle line:84%
of our body as being the
same inner energy that

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.146 align:middle line:90%
powers our enlightenment.

00:41:16.146 --> 00:41:18.695 align:middle line:84%
The practitioner
of sexual tantra

00:41:18.695 --> 00:41:21.500 align:middle line:84%
attempts to use the
energy of conception

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.105 align:middle line:84%
as an agent for awakening
and transcendence.

00:41:24.105 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Complete awakening
results in a normal person

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:84%
becoming a fully enlightened
and realized human being.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:10%
This enables the individual to
transcend birth, death, space

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.200 align:middle line:10%
and time.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.470 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.810 align:middle line:84%
The Six Yogas of Naropa
is a classical collection

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:49.470 align:middle line:84%
of techniques from India which
will result in Buddhahood

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.685 align:middle line:84%
or complete enlightenment
when fully mastered.

00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Many of these methods
were transmitted

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.234 align:middle line:84%
by Mahasiddhas who
are often couples

00:41:59.234 --> 00:42:01.905 align:middle line:84%
that achieved enlightenment
through the practice

00:42:01.905 --> 00:42:02.530 align:middle line:90%
of sexual yoga.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The famous saying
that Buddhahood

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:84%
can be found in the
vagina of a woman

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:23.516 align:middle line:84%
refers to an ancient
tradition of sexual yoga

00:42:23.516 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that results in
complete awakening.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.420 align:middle line:84%
The full potential of activating
the original reproductive

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:84%
energy of the human body
transforms a normal person

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.240 align:middle line:90%
into an enlightened immortal.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.649 align:middle line:84%
Many of these lineages go
back to famous Mahasiddhas

00:42:40.649 --> 00:42:41.440 align:middle line:90%
like Padmasambhava.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.150 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Padmasambhava is known to have
said that more women than men

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.160 align:middle line:84%
would achieve tantric
enlightenment because

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.645 align:middle line:90%
of their devotion to practice.

00:42:52.645 --> 00:42:57.088 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.088 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>The tantras are
sometimes revealed,

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:02.610 align:middle line:84%
both the Hindu tantras
and the Buddhist

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:84%
tantras, in exactly the
terms that you gave.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
That enlightenment
is found inside,

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.290 align:middle line:84%
or abiding within the
bhaga, within the womb,

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.040 align:middle line:90%
within the vagina.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:21.380 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
To open out to the state of
wholeness and completeness,

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.350 align:middle line:84%
which we can call openness,
we can call sunyata,

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.210 align:middle line:84%
we can call
emptiness, we can call

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:84%
voidness-- there are many
ways of describing it.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I like the word
"openness," because it has

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.610 align:middle line:90%
that quality of the unbounded.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So this vaginal
phenomenon is a way

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.460 align:middle line:84%
of saying that at the same
time this experience is

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.720 align:middle line:84%
completely open, completely
pleasurable, indeed

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.850 align:middle line:90%
orgasmic, and luminous.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.350 align:middle line:10%
Those are the three
characteristics

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:01.440 align:middle line:10%
of the enlightened state in
a Tibetan tantric system--

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.970 align:middle line:10%
openness, luminosity
and pleasure.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that we keep coming across

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.480 align:middle line:90%
in text after text after text.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.030 align:middle line:90%
What is experience is that?

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.810 align:middle line:84%
A person rediscovers
what you were

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:26.185 align:middle line:84%
saying as the original face--
the original, primordial embryo

00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:30.920 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, the very
basis of our existence.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.710 align:middle line:84%
The tantras also
talk about the mother

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and the son reuniting together.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:39.040 align:middle line:84%
The white drop and the
red drop joining together,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:84%
a symbol, of course,
of conception itself.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So that the imagery of
sexuality is in there

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's part
of it and that's

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.770 align:middle line:84%
key to a lot of
human experience.

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's sexuality going
on in every cell of your body

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.490 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.230 align:middle line:84%
The light of the
sun in your heart

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.870 align:middle line:84%
through meditation and
then spontaneously forming

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:07.430 align:middle line:84%
a conflagration in
every single cell

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.280 align:middle line:84%
of your body, that
is the kind of thing

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.020 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So that the joining of the
two sides of the double helix

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.030 align:middle line:84%
of DNA inside the
nucleus in every cell

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:84%
is living that sexual
bliss in every moment

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.065 align:middle line:84%
as it produces the proteins
that keep you alive.

00:45:25.065 --> 00:45:32.780 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.216 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Buddha,
you see every particle

00:45:36.216 --> 00:45:40.770 align:middle line:84%
of time and matter
and energy continually

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:45.720 align:middle line:84%
generating as it were in a
sexual, reproductive way, all

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.410 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena of
existence at all times.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:52.554 align:middle line:84%
You're living a blissful,
highly energetic kind of life.

00:45:52.554 --> 00:45:58.230 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>From a Tibetan
perspective, the difference

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.210 align:middle line:84%
between Buddhas and
ordinary individuals

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.560 align:middle line:84%
is merely a question
of diligent practice.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Tibetan teachers have
spoken with some reluctance

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.290 align:middle line:90%
about sexual yoga.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:18.540 align:middle line:84%
In every case that I have
personally encountered,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:23.770 align:middle line:84%
it has always been about
something to do with families,

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and really elite
families preserving

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:84%
very special traditions
within that family,

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:33.136 align:middle line:84%
within the customs and the
beliefs of that family.

00:46:33.136 --> 00:46:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Many traditions believe
that if the energy meridians

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.260 align:middle line:84%
of the body are fully opened,
the individual will inevitably

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.935 align:middle line:90%
achieve complete realization.

00:46:47.935 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.150 align:middle line:84%
The Kundalini
experience activates

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:84%
the starting point of
the body and results

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.860 align:middle line:84%
in the ultimate realization
of a person's potential.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a discovery in
which the entire universe is

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.550 align:middle line:90%
found to exist within the mind.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.775 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous
sayings in Tibet

00:47:10.775 --> 00:47:14.800 align:middle line:84%
is, there can be no Mahamudra,
which is enlightenment,

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.770 align:middle line:90%
without Karmamudra, sexual yoga.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Although the majority of
Buddhist monks are celibate,

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.240 align:middle line:84%
the tradition of the
Mahasiddhas believe

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that the Buddha may have
achieved enlightenment

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.940 align:middle line:84%
through the practice
of sexual yoga.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.470 align:middle line:10%
Because Mahamudra, which
is complete enlightenment,

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.080 align:middle line:10%
can only be achieved
through Karmamudra,

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.080 align:middle line:10%
which is sexual yoga.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.810 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>In other words, the apparent
peace and almost stasis

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of a Buddha image
does not really

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:52.591 align:middle line:84%
adequately reflect the dance
or phenomenon that is truly

00:47:52.591 --> 00:47:53.840 align:middle line:90%
at the heart of enlightenment.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.430 align:middle line:90%


00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>The complete potential of
fully harnessing and activating

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.600 align:middle line:84%
the original reproductive
or sexual energy of the body

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.500 align:middle line:84%
is one in which the human
being transforms into a Buddha,

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.350 align:middle line:90%
or an immortal.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:15.210 align:middle line:84%
The ability to activate
the Kundalini with sex

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:18.570 align:middle line:84%
requires strict adherence
to precise techniques

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:22.380 align:middle line:84%
combined with specialized
breathing methods.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.430 align:middle line:84%
The reason that Western couples
are not achieving enlightenment

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.590 align:middle line:84%
through the practice
of sexual yoga

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:31.360 align:middle line:84%
is that they are not aware
of the authentic methods

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't activated
the pre-birth energy.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.470 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the body
between the time of conception

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and birth within
everyone is enlightened

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.135 align:middle line:84%
and is connected to
the void, or the Tao.

00:48:45.135 --> 00:48:50.700 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:55.140 align:middle line:84%
The goal of inner alchemical
practices that use sexual yoga

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.330 align:middle line:84%
is to recreate conception
by uniting the yin

00:48:58.330 --> 00:48:59.820 align:middle line:90%
and yang subtle bodies.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.180 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Tantric Buddhahood transforms
a normal human being

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:07.720 align:middle line:90%
into an enlightened immortal.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Chinese medicine
also use the transformation

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.840 align:middle line:84%
of the reproductive
energy of the body

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.875 align:middle line:84%
to enable an adept to
achieve immortality

00:49:22.875 --> 00:49:25.070 align:middle line:84%
through successful
inner alchemical

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:29.040 align:middle line:84%
practice that use the complete
activation of the starting

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.140 align:middle line:90%
point of the body.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.920 align:middle line:10%
This tradition goes
back to the time

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.840 align:middle line:10%
of the Yellow Emperor who
is said to have created

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.410 align:middle line:10%
the Chinese medical tradition.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:46.480 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet, the union of the
Trikaya, or three bodies,

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.270 align:middle line:84%
using sexual yoga
is known to result

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.356 align:middle line:90%
in tantric enlightenment.

00:49:50.356 --> 00:49:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:57.490 align:middle line:84%
These systems are
based on the concept

00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that the pre-birth energy of
the body, the energy system that

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.600 align:middle line:84%
is created between the time
of conception and birth,

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.040 align:middle line:84%
is enlightened and is
connected to the void, or Tao.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.540 align:middle line:84%
This energy lies dormant
in a normal person.

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.460 align:middle line:84%
In many yogic systems,
the final process

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that transforms a human
being into an immortal,

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.940 align:middle line:84%
or living Buddha, is
a sexual yoga practice

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.752 align:middle line:84%
that results in full
Kundalini activation.

00:50:27.752 --> 00:50:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The goal of all
these traditions is

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.200 align:middle line:84%
to create the spiritual embryo,
or embryo of Buddhahood.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:48.422 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.422 --> 00:50:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Of course, I'm talking in
some ways as a Christian,

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and a Christian
loves everything.

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.280 align:middle line:90%
God is love.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So if people are experiencing
a loving relationship

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.671 align:middle line:84%
through sexuality, they're
going to be changed by that

00:51:00.671 --> 00:51:02.421 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
attain enlightenment.

00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:13.720 align:middle line:90%


00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.790 align:middle line:84%
If you study with someone like
Namkhai Norbu, for example,

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:19.020 align:middle line:84%
he'll make a very
clear distinction

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.150 align:middle line:84%
between tantric methods
of attainment and Dzogchen

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.750 align:middle line:90%
methods.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:28.190 align:middle line:84%
He'll even distinguish
Dzogchen, which sometimes

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.490 align:middle line:90%
sounds like zen to some of us.

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:32.480 align:middle line:90%
He'll distinguish it from zen.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So he'll notice
these things how.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Because he's been
through this stuff.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.950 align:middle line:84%
He knows that from his
own inner experience,

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:41.950 align:middle line:84%
so he can make those
distinctions very clearly.

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who are
not yet as highly

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.400 align:middle line:84%
realized as Namkhai Norbu
are walking on thin ice

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.350 align:middle line:84%
if we try to make too many
distinctions without rooting it

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:53.535 align:middle line:90%
in our own inner experience.

00:51:53.535 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:90%


00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>In both China and
Tibet, it is well

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.930 align:middle line:84%
known that the most advanced
spiritual practitioners leave

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:23.660 align:middle line:84%
no bodies after
the time of death,

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.474 align:middle line:84%
and this represents
the achievement

00:52:25.474 --> 00:52:26.640 align:middle line:90%
of whole body enlightenment.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Padmasambhava was a
legendary mahasiddha,

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:46.360 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the
founder of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.310 align:middle line:84%
The lineage that he
started in the 8th century

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.310 align:middle line:84%
has a particular
phenomenon known

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:54.200 align:middle line:84%
as the body of light
associated with it

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.840 align:middle line:84%
in which, when the
meditator dies,

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:02.710 align:middle line:84%
his physical body shrinks away
to nothing within a few days.

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:10%
Practitioners of the primordial
yoga system originally

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.040 align:middle line:10%
transmitted by
Padmasambhava continue

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.600 align:middle line:10%
to experience the
post-mortem dissolution

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.300 align:middle line:10%
of the body in modern times.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.180 align:middle line:10%


00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Ramalinga in India,
Jesus of Nazareth,

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.435 align:middle line:10%
and the Yellow Emperor
in China are all

00:53:23.435 --> 00:53:26.310 align:middle line:10%
believed to have left no
bodies upon their deaths.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:31.840 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment
without remainder may

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.780 align:middle line:84%
be the basis of ascension
stories throughout history.

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Chinese legends say when a great
master achieves immortality,

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:49.070 align:middle line:84%
he casts no shadow, he appears
and disappears at will,

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and ascends to heaven
in broad daylight.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:56.592 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things that happens
when a great teacher dies

00:53:56.592 --> 00:53:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is that there are often
phenomena-- things that

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.875 align:middle line:84%
impress their disciples as
to the degree of holiness

00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:03.170 align:middle line:90%
in that person.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And so in some of the
Tibetan traditions

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:11.000 align:middle line:84%
there is a phenomenon that
is called "the rainbow

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.160 align:middle line:84%
body," in which the
body of the deceased

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.130 align:middle line:84%
manifests light
phenomena after death.

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Often, it takes the form
of rainbows in the sky.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:26.490 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
about the body that

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:30.490 align:middle line:84%
begins to dissolve its
material substance into light.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1998, an often
repeated story

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.470 align:middle line:84%
emerged once again from a
village in the remote Kham

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:52.070 align:middle line:90%
region of Eastern Tibet.

00:54:52.070 --> 00:55:04.870 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It is said that a
rainbow appeared

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:13.020 align:middle line:84%
one day above the cabin of
Khenpo Achos, a devout Lama who

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.590 align:middle line:84%
had continued to practice
and teach Buddhism

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:18.910 align:middle line:84%
despite the severe restrictions
of the Chinese government.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:26.290 align:middle line:90%


00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:28.820 align:middle line:90%
He was in his 80s, but not sick.

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, he
laid down on his bed,

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:38.256 align:middle line:84%
began reciting the Tibetan
mantra om mani padme hum,

00:55:38.256 --> 00:55:39.232 align:middle line:90%
and died.

00:55:39.232 --> 00:55:45.100 align:middle line:90%


00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after, the nuns, monks
and others who studied with him

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.260 align:middle line:84%
began the Tibetan Buddhist
prayers that accompany death.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.930 align:middle line:84%
They noticed that
Khenpo Achos' skin

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:57.660 align:middle line:90%
began to turn soft and pinkish.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.550 align:middle line:84%
His students hurried to
another Lama to ask about this,

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and he told them
to cover the body

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:90%
and continue their prayers.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.680 align:middle line:84%
They placed a thin, yellow
monk's cloak over him,

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.195 align:middle line:84%
and as the days passed, they
saw his body was shrinking.

00:56:16.195 --> 00:56:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.130 align:middle line:10%
By the end of the week,
the students reported,

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.860 align:middle line:10%
nothing remained.

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:28.890 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Khenpo Achos had
apparently become

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
what is known in Tibetan
Buddhism as a "rainbow body."

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.980 align:middle line:84%
The story spread through
Buddhist circles.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Many realized that the
miraculous event had

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.040 align:middle line:90%
implications for Christianity.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:84%
They believed if
we can establish

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:58.430 align:middle line:84%
as an anthropological
fact that what

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:01.490 align:middle line:84%
is described in the
Resurrection of Jesus

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:04.830 align:middle line:84%
had not only happened to
others but is happening today,

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:06.980 align:middle line:84%
it would put our view
of human potential

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.890 align:middle line:90%
in a completely different light.

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:18.040 align:middle line:90%


00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Even if we were to
think of it as ultimately

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.410 align:middle line:84%
explainable by some form
of physics that has not yet

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.680 align:middle line:84%
been devised or something
in quantum physics,

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.270 align:middle line:84%
we can give all kinds
of explanations.

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, it's a
paranormal phenomenon.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that happens every day,

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and it does seem to
have a connection

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:38.350 align:middle line:90%
to spiritual practice.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.995 align:middle line:84%
>>In China, many great
sages and alchemists

00:57:48.995 --> 00:57:53.440 align:middle line:84%
are also said to have left
empty graves after death.

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.120 align:middle line:84%
In Asia, the highest
level of meditation

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.010 align:middle line:84%
has always been known
as enlightenment

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:02.350 align:middle line:84%
without remainder, in
which the physical body has

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:03.962 align:middle line:90%
dissolved into pure energy.

00:58:03.962 --> 00:58:11.658 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.658 --> 00:58:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>To the point where their
body and mind are engaged

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:20.220 align:middle line:84%
in spiritual practice and
mystical illumination,

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.810 align:middle line:84%
habitually, every
microsecond of the day,

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:27.710 align:middle line:84%
it is highly likely that
their body/mind complex

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.480 align:middle line:84%
will do unusual things
at the point of death.

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Whether that means preserving
the body from decay,

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.840 align:middle line:84%
as occurs in the
incorruptible saints,

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
manifestation of stigmata,

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.920 align:middle line:84%
manifestation of other
internal symbols on the bones

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.715 align:middle line:84%
or organs of the
body, as has been

00:58:45.715 --> 00:58:48.840 align:middle line:84%
seen in some Catholic
saints, or whether it's

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be these phenomena
of dissolution, shrinkage,

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.280 align:middle line:84%
or complete
disappearance, it all

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.490 align:middle line:84%
depends on how that person has
engaged with spiritual practice

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:04.410 align:middle line:84%
such that everything that
you are is in the process,

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:05.640 align:middle line:90%
in the practice.

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.685 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
what this is all about.

00:59:07.685 --> 00:59:09.500 align:middle line:84%
That spiritual
practice is really

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:15.207 align:middle line:84%
about a total engagement of
every last atom in your body.

00:59:15.207 --> 00:59:19.410 align:middle line:90%


00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>The goal of life is to
discover who we really.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:25.910 align:middle line:84%
At the highest level
of meditation and yoga

00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:28.440 align:middle line:84%
we see our original
face, and this

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.610 align:middle line:84%
enables us to enter the
Tao and fully discover

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:33.347 align:middle line:90%
who we have always really been.

00:59:33.347 --> 00:59:37.010 align:middle line:90%


00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:40.200 align:middle line:10%
>>What we're talking about,
in terms of spirituality,

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.830 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the body, in
terms of enlightenment,

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:45.560 align:middle line:10%
is we're making the
claim, along with all

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:50.080 align:middle line:10%
the great historical traditions,
that there's something

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.660 align:middle line:10%
more that we are already.

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.770 align:middle line:10%
There's something more that
we can realize in our bodies

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:03.160 align:middle line:10%
cannot be restricted merely to
a vast complex of desires which

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.010 align:middle line:10%
will come to an end
with our last breath.

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:11.730 align:middle line:10%
Khenpo Achos, this Tibetan monk,
out in his little Hermitage

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:17.030 align:middle line:10%
in Eastern Tibet, breathing
his last with the words

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:24.220 align:middle line:10%
om mani padme hum
and then dying.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And then his face turns into
the face of a little child,

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.970 align:middle line:84%
pink and more alive than
the 81-year-old man who

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.150 align:middle line:90%
said his final mantra.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Om mani padme hum, om mani
padme hum, om mani padme hum.

01:00:43.210 --> 01:01:00.380 align:middle line:90%


01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>There is something
formed in chaos coming

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:05.320 align:middle line:84%
before heaven and
earth, existing

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.465 align:middle line:90%
in the silent and tranquil void.

01:01:07.465 --> 01:01:10.110 align:middle line:90%
It stands alone and unchanging.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
It pervades everywhere
without becoming exhausted.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
It is the mother of
heaven and earth.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:20.092 align:middle line:84%
I do not know its name,
and so call it Tao.

01:01:20.092 --> 01:01:27.170 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.910 align:middle line:84%
The future of modern
science is to discover

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.210 align:middle line:90%
the mind of the Tao.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:34.840 align:middle line:90%


01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
As science studies
meditation and the evolution

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
the basic unification

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.469 align:middle line:84%
of Eastern and Western
paradigms of the evolution

01:01:43.469 --> 01:01:44.760 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness is inevitable.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.710 align:middle line:90%


01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Modern science
will become focused

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
on enabling human
beings to achieve

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
their complete potential,
which is enlightenment.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Scientists will realize that the
completion stage of meditation

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is the primordial vision
of the original face.

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
This represents
the ultimate level

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:08.736 align:middle line:90%
of human mind/body evolution.

01:02:08.736 --> 01:02:14.840 align:middle line:90%


01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>There are hints, there are
suggestions, that things go on

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
in the human body/mind complex
that have not been completely

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.855 align:middle line:84%
explained by science, by
technology, by psychotherapy,

01:02:26.855 --> 01:02:29.740 align:middle line:90%
by quantum physics, or whatever.

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're just being
invited to explore more deeply.

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:34.686 align:middle line:84%
We may actually come up with
a new theory, a new paradigm.

01:02:34.686 --> 01:02:39.150 align:middle line:90%


01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Darwin's Theory of Evolution
does not include the fact

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that the human reproductive
system is perfectly

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
designed to achieve
enlightenment,

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:50.005 align:middle line:84%
and that this is actually
the purpose of the evolution

01:02:50.005 --> 01:02:50.713 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:02:50.713 --> 01:02:56.070 align:middle line:90%


01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Evolutionary psychology
is based on the idea

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that all human behavior
is merely an attempt

01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:04.220 align:middle line:90%
to reproduce sexually.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this is that
it leaves out the basic fact

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that the human reproductive
system is perfectly

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.352 align:middle line:84%
designed to achieve
enlightenment

01:03:12.352 --> 01:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
by unifying the pre-birth and
post-birth chi of the body.

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:20.200 align:middle line:90%


01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the basis of the
Chinese medical system,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and represents the
future of science

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.269 align:middle line:84%
in the 21st century as
the Philosopher's Stone is

01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:28.810 align:middle line:90%
rediscovered.

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:34.450 align:middle line:90%


01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>It shows that the
human body is a device

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
itself has generated

01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
enabling that enlightenment
to burst upon the scene.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, your body,
with all its aches and pains,

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and some people
tell us we weren't

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
meant to stand up on
two legs, and a lot

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
of problems that
have come into play

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
because of the shape of our
body and the way the organs

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
are set up.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it from
a Buddhist point of view,

01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
your body is set up so that the
energy goes from the perineum,

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
from the crotch, from
the base of the spine,

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
up through the subtle body
and the material body, both

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
in intimate union so that it
gets to the top of your head

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and beyond so that you
can attain enlightenment.

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
If you were a
monkey or a dog, you

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:27.474 align:middle line:84%
have some of those
same structures,

01:04:27.474 --> 01:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
positioned in such a way

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to favor the attainment
of enlightenment.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So that you're sitting
in meditation in accord

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
with a certain set of
points that highlight,

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
accentuate and enhance
the inherent properties

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
of the human body to
attain enlightenment.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is a little
machine we've

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
been given for attaining that
high degree of consciousness.

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
This is magnificent stuff.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
suddenly realize,

01:04:55.450 --> 01:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
oh, even if we did evolve from
so-called lower forms of life,

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
we are also in continuity
with those forms of life such

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
that what we attain is not just
private property, but is good,

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.190 align:middle line:90%
cosmic benefit.

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.742 align:middle line:84%
And then you get immediately
into the whole Bodhisattva vow,

01:05:17.742 --> 01:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
the idea of doing this for the
sake of all sentient beings.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:40.550 align:middle line:90%


01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>There is an ancient
story from China

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
in which a famous
zen master told

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
his student, if you see the
Buddha on the road, kill him.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:55.110 align:middle line:90%


01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
What is meant by this
story is that your idea

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddha as a sacred
figure to be worshipped

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
is incorrect, and is an illusion
that actually is blocking

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
your own perception of your
own awareness as enlightenment,

01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and your own realization
that you yourself have always

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.150 align:middle line:90%
been a living Buddha.

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:23.070 align:middle line:90%


01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The fully activated
starting point of the body

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.030 align:middle line:90%
is your original face.

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:30.510 align:middle line:90%


01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>The Dalai Lama
says very clearly

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
how no self, Buddhist teaching
on no self and all of that,

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:43.590 align:middle line:84%
is not about the destruction
of the personality.

01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a transformative
process that

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
has to do with who you
really are comes to the fore,

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.200 align:middle line:90%
and what you are not disappears.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Buddhahood, immortality
or enlightenment actually

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
represent the true potential
of each human being

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:02.080 align:middle line:90%
to fully awaken.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.260 align:middle line:84%
This is inevitably
going to be the goal

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.210 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution
of consciousness

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.202 align:middle line:90%
in the 21st century.

01:07:07.202 --> 01:07:11.750 align:middle line:90%


01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:14.680 align:middle line:10%
We are at the edge of time
when achieving enlightenment

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.160 align:middle line:10%
will become a phenomenon
recognized by Western science

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.800 align:middle line:10%
as both the completion
stage of meditation

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.474 align:middle line:10%
and the achievement of matter,
energy and consciousness

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:24.974 align:middle line:10%
unification.

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:32.570 align:middle line:90%


01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:35.670 align:middle line:84%
When enough individuals
have activated the Kundalini

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and seen their original
face within themselves,

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:41.884 align:middle line:84%
the human race will be
completely transformed.

01:07:41.884 --> 01:08:01.970 align:middle line:90%


01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:04.330 align:middle line:10%
Already today,
millions of people

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:08.270 align:middle line:10%
practice yoga, meditation,
Tai Chi and Qigong.

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:15.600 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
The complete evolution
of consciousness

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.870 align:middle line:84%
is the result of these mind/body
arts when fully mastered.

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:25.600 align:middle line:90%


01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
The goal of our existence is
to reach our ultimate potential

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.249 align:middle line:90%
as fully enlightened beings.

01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:37.670 align:middle line:90%


01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Bodhidharma said, our
original face is the mind.

01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:44.399 align:middle line:90%
The mind is our original face.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:47.325 align:middle line:84%
This mind is the same as
the mind of all Buddhas.

01:08:47.325 --> 01:08:51.200 align:middle line:90%


01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Buddhas of the past and future
merely transmit this mind.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Beyond your mind, there
is no Buddha anywhere,

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
but confused people don't
realize that their own mind is

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:03.290 align:middle line:90%
the Buddha.

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:06.250 align:middle line:90%


01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They keep searching for
truth outside of themselves.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't become lost
in such illusions.

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:30.840 align:middle line:90%


01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Just realize that
there is no Buddha

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:36.080 align:middle line:90%
outside of your own mind.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are,
there is a Buddha.

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Your mind has always
been a living Buddha.

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:55.340 align:middle line:90%


01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you see a
Buddha on the road,

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
there is no need for
reverence-- just kill him,

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.010 align:middle line:90%
because it is a false illusion.

01:10:02.010 --> 01:13:51.010 align:middle line:90%


01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:53.136 align:middle line:84%
If people will
cultivate the Tao,

01:13:53.136 --> 01:13:55.650 align:middle line:90%
their bodies will be strong.

01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:58.380 align:middle line:84%
By cultivating the
Tao for a long time,

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
one can transform
substance to spirit,

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
refining their body into subtle
energy and merge with the Tao.

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Then their knowledge
is boundless,

01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and their physical
body is transcended.

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:14.392 align:middle line:90%
This is the power of the Tao.

01:14:14.392 --> 01:14:18.640 align:middle line:90%


01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Speaking without speaking
and moving without moving

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
is called "the profound
and secret virtue."

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
You look at it and
it is not seen.

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.080 align:middle line:90%
It is called "the formless."

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
You listen to it
and it is not heard,

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:37.660 align:middle line:90%
it is called "the soundless."

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You grasp it and
it cannot be held.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:43.840 align:middle line:10%
It is called "the intangible."

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
The ancient sages were
masters at penetrating

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:51.030 align:middle line:90%
the subtle and profound Tao.

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you hold the body
and spirit as one?

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Concentrating your chi
and becoming pliant,

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
can you become like
a newborn baby?

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Clearing your mind and
contemplating the profound,

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.500 align:middle line:90%
can you remain unknown?

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.270 align:middle line:84%
In understanding all things,
can you remain detached?

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:16.270 align:middle line:90%


01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
The highest enlightenment
is like water.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:25.212 align:middle line:84%
Water benefits all beings,
yet argues with no one.

01:15:25.212 --> 01:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It flows in unknown
places, and in this way

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.870 align:middle line:90%
is close to the Tao.

01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the enlightened
do not go against nature,

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.590 align:middle line:90%
they are one with the Tao.

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:39.690 align:middle line:90%


01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
The Tao that can
be put into words

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.710 align:middle line:90%
is not the true and eternal Tao.

01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The Tao is an empty vessel-- it
is used, but never exhausted.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.065 align:middle line:84%
It is the fathomless
source of everything.

01:15:52.065 --> 01:15:59.995 align:middle line:90%


01:15:59.995 --> 01:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Under heaven, there is
nothing more yielding

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and soft as water--
yet for attacking

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
what is hard and rigid,
there is nothing better.

01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:12.860 align:middle line:84%
In this way, the weak
can vanquish the strong

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.192 align:middle line:84%
and the soft can
overcome the hard.

01:16:15.192 --> 01:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%


01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.280 align:middle line:90%
People follow the way of earth.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Earth follows the way of heaven.

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Heaven follows the way of Tao.

01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Tao follows its own natural way.

01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%


01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:35.660 align:middle line:84%
There is something
formed in chaos coming

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.260 align:middle line:84%
before heaven and
earth, existing

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.820 align:middle line:90%
in the silent and tranquil void.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.120 align:middle line:90%
It stands alone and unchanging.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It pervades everywhere
without becoming exhausted.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It is the mother of
heaven and earth.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I do not know its name,
and so call it Tao.

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:56.660 align:middle line:90%


01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.800 align:middle line:84%
To know others is
wisdom, but to master

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.370 align:middle line:90%
one's self in enlightenment.

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:04.810 align:middle line:90%


01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Those who conquer others
require great strength.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But to conquer one's
self requires true power.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:24.096 align:middle line:90%
