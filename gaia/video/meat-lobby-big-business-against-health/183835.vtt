>> To see what happens
inside the body,

in the test tube.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Then they observed what
happened to the cells.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So you see that if
you have no exposure,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
you see that
everything is intact.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%
So the material stays together.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you are exposed
to nitrosamines

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that induce
breakages of the DNA,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
you see this comet
tail appearing.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So you see that here, the
damage is quite extensive.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So the more damage you
have, the more likely

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
it is that a cell like
this will eventually mutate

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:90%
into a pre-cancer type of cell.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> How long does it
take for such a damage?

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this damage can be
induced relatively quickly.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So in this assay, when
we isolate the cells--

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and we only expose
them for half an hour--

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and then you already see the
breakage of these DNA strands.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:90%
That's how fast it can happen.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And it can also happen not
just in the lab here, but also

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:90%
in an intact human body.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we stop using
nitrites, then what?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> That would make a difference
of potentially several

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
thousands of colorectal cancer
that's in Europe every year.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That's huge?

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That's huge.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Because colorectal cancer
is a very frequent disease.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Already small changes
in cancer risk

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.281 align:middle line:84%
can have a big impact
in the large population.

00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands fewer cancers and
therefore potentially fewer

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
deaths just by
suppressing nitrites.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But the food industry has
a sledgehammer argument

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.227 align:middle line:84%
for justifying the
use of nitrites.

00:10:22.227 --> 00:10:23.435 align:middle line:90%
It protects us from botulism.

00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:27.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Botulism is a form of
food poisoning caused

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
by bacteria that affect
our central nervous system

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:90%
and can be deadly.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Scary, right?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.825 align:middle line:84%
But there's a glitch
in their argument.

00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:84%
There are already
companies which

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
do produce processed
meats without nitrites,

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and their customers
are in fine form.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
If you happen to be in
Copenhagen in Denmark,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
just after the Little Mermaid
and the quayside promenade,

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
pop into a supermarket
like we did.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
There, you'll find cured
meats without nitrites.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And for those whose Danish
has gone a bit rusty,

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:90%
it's uden nitrit.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
You can easily recognize
it by its color,

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:90%
more brownish than pretty pink.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And the best known brand is
produced 150 kilometers south

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
of the capital in Denmark's
biggest organic processed meat

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:90%
plant, Hanegal.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.412 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The boss, a biochemist,
started in nitrite-free cured

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:90%
meats 25 years ago.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Since then, the Danish
health authorities

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
haven't registered a
single case of botulism

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:90%
caused by processed meat.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We do not have problems
with this bacteria.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say for
the last 50 years,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
this has not been a reasonable
topic in Western Europe.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
That was a problem in meat
industry 100 years ago,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
where things were not
as clean as they are.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Slaughterhouses were not
as clean as they are today.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:90%
So no worry about bacteria.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to worry
about additives

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:90%
that might be cancer producing.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And if they are not necessary
for some very good reasons,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:90%
we should not use them.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> For you, the cancer risk
today is the main risk.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the main
risk today, definitely.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it has
been so for 30, 40 years.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do producers still
put nitrites in meat?

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The main reason is that they
are afraid that customers will

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:84%
not accept products which do
not have the red color that they

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:84%
have been used to
for many, many years.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Hanegal is one of the few
food industry companies to do

00:13:15.855 --> 00:13:16.655 align:middle line:90%
without nitrites.

00:13:16.655 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet, experts have been
ringing alarm bells for years.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago, a European
Union health report already

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
recommended reducing
the amounts of nitrite

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:90%
used in processed meats.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, this report even
put forward banning its use

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Despite the increasing
number of studies,

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the European
Commission still allows

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.145 align:middle line:84%
industrial food companies
to add lots of nitrites

00:13:46.145 --> 00:13:46.945 align:middle line:90%
to the products.

00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:54.383 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.383 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So we went to ask
the commissioner

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
for health and food safety,
a former health minister

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.855 align:middle line:90%
in Lithuania, a few questions.

00:14:00.855 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Why don't get
the levels lower?

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like to guarantee
you that it is, of course,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.950 align:middle line:84%
in the hands of institutions,
which are responsible

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
to follow, to say, and to
present to us final results.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And those always takes
time and responsibility.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> For over an hour, the
commissioner attempted to pull

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:84%
the wool over our eyes in spite
of all the reports by experts,

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:84%
which for 25 years have
warned the authorities about

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:90%
the dangers of nitrites.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> All these studies, you
don't think they're enough?

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>> All those studies are open.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And you see why thanks
to transparency, thanks

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to possibility to have them,
to show to people that we

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
are ready to follow,
and to see, and to do,

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:90%
how to move as soon as possible.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Transparency is good,
but decisions are better.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> All decisions are
in line of procedures.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine like
that decision to make?

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.650 align:middle line:84%
If I will be king of
the European Union, oh.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But I am not king
of European Union.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, this story has
been going on for so long.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Sorry to say.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> This study shows that all
standards are in safety line.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In this case, why Europe lost
against Denmark in the European

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Court of Justice in
this nitrite story?

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't answer this.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I would like to get
more information,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
because I am not one
who knows everything.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's look at the
facts, Mr. Commissioner.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Denmark wanted to limit
the use of nitrites.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
The European Commission
was against it.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And in 2003 in
court, the Danes won

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in the name of the
protection of public health.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I am very happy about
European court decisions.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Then European court
decision always shows

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:90%
that public health is priority.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:84%
It means that DG Sante
and the commissioner

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
responsible for public health
is in better conditions.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, since
this court ruling,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
EU regulations are
just as lax as ever.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> From my point of view,
we must be more energetic,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.995 align:middle line:84%
asking industry to change the
technology that formulates

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
food, to follow figures to
keep on board public health

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
priorities, not
profit, absolutely.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:90%
But, of course, it takes time.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Time, perfect.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
That's just what the
food industry wants

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.235 align:middle line:84%
and what it has built its
strategy on for years.

00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.109 align:middle line:84%
Because when it
comes to nitrites,

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
industrialists have been waiting
out the clock for 40 years,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
40 years of scientific
manipulation, blackmail,

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:84%
and intense lobbying
so the meat business

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
can carry on bringing
home the bacon.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And it all began on the
other side of the Atlantic.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
If you think we're
exaggerating, listen to this.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1970s,
nitrite was almost

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
banned in the United States
just after the publication

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
of a large-scale study
requested by the government.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>> A relationship between
cancer and nitrite was proved,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:90%
suggested.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> No, proved, and
a fairly strong one.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
There were 2,000 rats
involved in this study.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a very extensive study done
by a well-respected scientist.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The banning of nitrites
was announced in the press,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.505 align:middle line:84%
but the American Meat Institute
would bring out its big guns.

00:18:17.505 --> 00:18:20.730 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:84%
In his office
overlooking the capital,

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%
its president, Richard
Lyng, spoke out.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Processed meats that contain
nitrites are a big thing.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.030 align:middle line:84%
The retail value of them,
about $12.5 billion.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
About 2/3 of the hog
production in the United States

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:90%
goes into cured meats.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:84%
One is to go through her
work with a fine tooth comb

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and find every little thing they
can possibly complain about.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And because the issues tend
to be fairly technical,

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:84%
if you're a politician,
if you're a reporter,

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
unless you're a highly
specialized reporter,

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
all you hear is,
well, this person

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:84%
said there was something
bad, and this other person

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:84%
said they didn't know what
they were talking about.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And so these efforts to
go after the scientists

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and to discredit the
scientists is a key element

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of a much larger
strategy to just

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
gum up the entire policymaking
process to the point where

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:90%
nothing happens.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
That translates into hundreds
of billions of dollars

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of sales and profits for them.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%

be held with the scientist,

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:20.350 align:middle line:84%
he gives his expert's point of
view, totally independently.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.663 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to introduce the
reasons why I think meat is

00:34:23.663 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:84%
an important component
of a healthy diet.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Spend just a very brief
amount of time on that.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> On that day,
he was in France,

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:84%
speaking to scientists from
around the world about meat

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and the link between processed
meat and cancer in order

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.159 align:middle line:84%
to denounce, backed
up by PowerPoint,

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:43.480 align:middle line:84%
the climate of fear,
panic, and even hysteria.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And we know, because
we were there.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.360 align:middle line:84%
It was right at the start
of our investigation

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.550 align:middle line:84%
when we barely
knew about nitrites

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and had the need of enlightened
specialists to help us.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are new reviews
published this year that say

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:84%
nitrite is not harmful and
others that say it is harmful.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody really
knows definitively what

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:90%
the answer is.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> A few months
after this handshake,

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
when we had learned more
about the industry of doubt,

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:90%
bells started ringing.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So we took advantage
of our trip to America

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to ask him for another
interview, only

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:84%
this time with a lot
more cards up our sleeve.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:41.160 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember being paid
by the American Meat Institute?

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Never?

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I was interested in
a scientist called Susan

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Preston-Martin.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know her?

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I know who she is.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I do not know her personally.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember
writing a paper on her--

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --for the American
Meat Institute?

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I found this.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was prepared for the
American Meat Institute.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>> [SIGHS]

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.060 align:middle line:84%
This is something
different, yes.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
This was done 20
years ago, roughly.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.310 align:middle line:90%
So I had forgotten about that.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember how much you
were paid for this evaluation?

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I do not.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.697 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it was
20 or 25 years ago.

00:36:28.697 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You didn't know when you were
working for the American Meat

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.403 align:middle line:84%
Institute that Philip Morris
was owning Oscar Mayer?

00:36:34.403 --> 00:36:36.335 align:middle line:90%
>> [SIGHS]

00:36:36.335 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say yes
or no at this point in time

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's more
than 20 years ago.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you know that the
tobacco strategy motto was,

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.360 align:middle line:90%
"Doubt is our product?"

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I never heard that.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Doubt was your product too.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That was not my--

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.170 align:middle line:90%
that was not my intent.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:84%
My intent was to
do an evaluation.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.930 align:middle line:84%
If I had read these papers
and found that there were not

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:13.260 align:middle line:84%
shortcomings in the papers,
that there were not deficiencies

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:84%
in the papers, I don't think
I would have criticized them.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But don't you think that your
point of view would be stronger

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and your argument stronger if I
hadn't found that you had been

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:84%
once paid by the
American Meat Institute?

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
would change--

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't change
my point of view.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It might change
your point of view

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that you tend to
not believe what

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:41.248 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying because 25 years
ago I got some amount of money

00:37:41.248 --> 00:37:42.165 align:middle line:90%
that I don't remember.

00:37:42.165 --> 00:37:44.670 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, we're making progress.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:84%
He can't remember how much, but
he does remember getting paid.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>> But you have to understand
that the industry is

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.500 align:middle line:84%
a moneymaking business, so
they're very risk averse.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:04.190 align:middle line:84%
They would not fund a study
that someone proposed to them

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.580 align:middle line:84%
that eating hot dogs increases
the risk of childhood cancer.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Why would they fund that?

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.280 align:middle line:84%
They would only
fund something that

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.070 align:middle line:84%
proposes that
childhood cancer is

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.860 align:middle line:84%
prevented by eating
more hot dogs

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:90%
or there's no relationship.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to fund a study that

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.750 align:middle line:90%
is bad for their business.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, at least he's honest.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Much of the meat
industry's lobbying

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:84%
depends on collaboration
with paid scientists,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's still
how things work.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:90%


00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:84%
During a conference on processed
meats and cancer in Lyon,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.510 align:middle line:90%
a French scientist confirmed it.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Denis Corpet is a
reference on the subject,

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.090 align:middle line:84%
an internationally-renowned
expert.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:84%
He speaks and acts
casually, and doesn't

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.320 align:middle line:84%
balk at telling us how things
work at scientific events.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> A few days later, Professor
Corpet sent us some names

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and photos of scientists
he suspects of being close

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.540 align:middle line:90%
to the food industry.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Among them, two Americans he
came across at a conference

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:17.830 align:middle line:84%
on meat and cancer, Andrew
Milkowski and Nathan Bryan.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:84%
As we checked out these
scientists' profiles,

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.690 align:middle line:84%
we discovered a document
which should certainly never

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:84%
have been on the web, an
internal report issued

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.300 align:middle line:90%
by the American Meat Institute.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It lays out the strategy for
influencing the decisions

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:40.300 align:middle line:90%
of high profile organizations.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:50.550 align:middle line:84%
This organization is the
IARC, the International Agency

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.555 align:middle line:90%
for Research on Cancer.

00:40:51.555 --> 00:40:56.060 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:84%
This institution,
based in Lyon, France,

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:84%
is the worldwide
reference on cancer.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.540 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.890 align:middle line:84%
In 2006, IARC scientists
classified nitrites

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:84%
in the probably carcinogenic
category of products, group 2A.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.808 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.808 --> 00:41:17.375 align:middle line:90%
And that was bad for business.

00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So lobbyists are
fighting to have

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.950 align:middle line:90%
this classification changed.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Page 64 of the document, "Change
in the IARC nitrite/nitrate

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:36.930 align:middle line:84%
classification from 2A to
2B," or possibly carcinogenic

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:39.350 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:45.300 align:middle line:84%
The strategy has a
name, IARC Challenge.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It notably involves
the two scientists

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:84%
we were interested in, Andrew
Milkowski and Nathan Bryan.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Armed with our
brand new file, it

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:05.380 align:middle line:84%
was time to set off to meet
the meat sector's heavyweights.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Nashville, Tennessee,
the capital of country music

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.335 align:middle line:84%
and notably the
hometown of Johnny Cash.

00:42:11.335 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:84%
It's here that the
American Meat Institute

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.820 align:middle line:84%
is holding its
annual conference,

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:84%
in this huge building,
to be precise.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:84%
The meat industry in the US
is very, very big business.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.790 align:middle line:84%
All of the world's
biggest players are here--

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Smithfield, number one in pork,
with a turnover of $14 billion

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:84%
a year, Cargill, the giant
with $33 billion a year

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:84%
in food alone, and Tyson, the
all-divisions record holder.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> This year, we'll make, with
all of our divisions between

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.050 align:middle line:84%
beef, pork, poultry,
and prepared,

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:84%
between $37 billion and
$40 billion in revenue.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a small company?

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Very small company, un peu.

00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:11.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> We checked.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.515 align:middle line:90%
It's over $41 billion.

00:43:13.515 --> 00:43:18.039 align:middle line:90%


00:43:18.039 --> 00:43:20.760 align:middle line:84%
After half an hour, we
spot a face in the crowd

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that rings a bell,
that woman there,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.340 align:middle line:90%
tasting nibbles at every stand.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:84%
That's right, page 92 of
the IARC Challenge document,

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:33.450 align:middle line:84%
here with the short hair,
the American Meat Institute's

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:84%
senior vice president of
public affairs, Janet Riley.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.490 align:middle line:90%


00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Excuse me, please.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:42.815 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:43:42.815 --> 00:43:42.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:43:42.981 --> 00:43:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you Janet Riley?

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, hello.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm Sandrine Rigaud.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm working for France 2 on
processed meat and cancer,

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and I have a question
about a document I found.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:90%
It is this document.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Do you know it?

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Who are you with?

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm working for France 2.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see you
registered here.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I wasn't
registered, but I

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.200 align:middle line:90%
have some important questions.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.012 align:middle line:84%
Could you give me
your business card?

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:09.953 align:middle line:90%
I have my journalist card.

00:44:09.953 --> 00:44:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's step outside.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a question.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.865 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know, what do you
know about the IARC Challenge?

00:44:14.865 --> 00:44:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what, I--

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.723 align:middle line:90%
>> The IARC Challenge here.

00:44:16.723 --> 00:44:19.181 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you turn off the camera
until I know what I'm doing?

00:44:19.181 --> 00:44:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's about
nitrite and cancer.

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I have this?

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.963 align:middle line:90%
This is mine, sorry.

00:44:23.963 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to know--

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so much
for our interview.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> He's also not registered.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Is he with you?

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Why are you recording?

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Having been
escorted outside--

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my press card.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> --and been ordered to show
ID, we try one last time.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It's France 2.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It looks like what tobacco
industry did for decades.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's your opinion.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:90%
That's your opinion.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:52.400 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is providing
science-based, peer-reviewed

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%
evidence that our
products are safe.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's all I'm
going to say right now.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:57.406 align:middle line:84%
>> But are you paying
those scientists--

00:44:57.406 --> 00:44:58.281 align:middle line:90%
>> And you know what?

00:44:58.281 --> 00:45:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I know you've got that
camera rolling, don't you?

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Luckily, for such cases,
we always have a plan B.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.510 align:middle line:84%
On the list of IARC
Challenge scientists,

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:14.280 align:middle line:84%
there was one who agreed to
see us, the first on the list,

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Andrew Milkowski.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:23.060 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.315 align:middle line:90%
We head to Madison, Wisconsin.

00:45:25.315 --> 00:45:33.730 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:84%
This city in the north
of the United States

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:84%
is home to Andrew Milkowski
and the company of hot dog

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.670 align:middle line:84%
king, Oscar Mayer,
who we came across

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.490 align:middle line:90%
in the Preston-Martin case.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:45.038 align:middle line:90%
>> America's number one.

00:45:45.038 --> 00:45:48.710 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The scientist worked for
this company for 30 years.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.280 align:middle line:84%
He now teaches at
the university,

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.070 align:middle line:84%
but he doesn't hide his
proximity to the American Meat

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Lobby.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Presented with our IARC
Challenge documents,

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.830 align:middle line:84%
he acknowledges
everything, or almost.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So did the meat
industry pay you for this?

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I received some
compensation for my time,

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.850 align:middle line:90%
as well as the others.

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>> How much?

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I am not going to say.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know, thousands or
tens of thousands of dollars?

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Small amounts.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Small amounts?

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Can we have an idea?

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Defending nitrites seems to be
a very big thing for industry.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking for substitutes
has been attempted,

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.920 align:middle line:90%
and was a total failure.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Something as chemically simple
as nitrite and as unique

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:59.270 align:middle line:84%
as nitrite, having a substitute
has not been possible

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:00.710 align:middle line:90%
to anyone's ability.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But if there is a small
risk of getting cancer,

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.880 align:middle line:84%
don't you think it's important
to try to find a solution?

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> That is where we disagree,
because I do not believe that

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.450 align:middle line:90%
that risk is true.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You think there
is no risk at all?

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the risk is
unquantifiable and unknown,

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:90%
if it indeed exists.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.680 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> On hearing that, we
pulled this expression.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So for Andrew Milkowski,
the colorectal cancer,

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.060 align:middle line:84%
the hundreds of studies on the
dangers of nitrites, none of it

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.990 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Off you go, nothing
to do with it.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:42.980 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:84%
In the United
States, it's thanks

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.240 align:middle line:84%
to scientists like Milkowski
that the meat industry

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.510 align:middle line:84%
has been able to cut
another notch in its belt,

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.528 align:middle line:84%
surprisingly in the health
conscious state of California.

00:47:53.528 --> 00:48:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:08.830 align:middle line:84%
This imposing building
is home to the state

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:84%
cabinet-level California
Environmental Protection

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.660 align:middle line:84%
We have an appointment
with Sam Delson,

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.390 align:middle line:84%
deputy director for external
and legislative affairs.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.930 align:middle line:90%


00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.180 align:middle line:84%
He'll show us a document
that doesn't exist

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.160 align:middle line:90%
in any other American state.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Michelle.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Long time no see.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Sam.

00:48:29.235 --> 00:48:30.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:48:30.785 --> 00:48:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Sandrine.

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:35.240 align:middle line:90%
So this is the list?

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a list of substances
judged dangerous to man

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.350 align:middle line:90%
by the state of California.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.580 align:middle line:84%
To do business
here, manufacturers

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.850 align:middle line:84%
are banned from using
these substances,

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:50.070 align:middle line:84%
or they are obliged
to warn consumers.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's very restrictive
because there are

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.960 align:middle line:90%
over 800 products on the list.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So a good example of
that would be tobacco smoke.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.210 align:middle line:90%
They talk about lead.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.950 align:middle line:84%
There's other
things like benzene.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:07.110 align:middle line:84%
That would be something we have
common in things like exhaust.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And then here, we have aspirin.

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>> You have aspirin?

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Aspirin, yeah.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a special note,
especially for pregnant women.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here's an odd one, but
things like bracken fern.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want to eat
this, go for it,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.043 align:middle line:84%
but be aware that
you maybe don't want

00:49:20.043 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:90%
to eat it every single day.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So we don't find nitrite?

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Nitrite is not on the list.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been years since
nitrites have been targeted,

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.770 align:middle line:84%
but procedures have
never been seen through.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> When we believe a chemical
meets the criteria for listing,

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.700 align:middle line:84%
we post what's known as a
notice of intent to list.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And that triggers
a period in which

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:84%
people can submit public
comments on whether it does

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:45.840 align:middle line:90%
or does not meet the criteria.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.750 align:middle line:84%
We review the comments before
making a final decision

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.690 align:middle line:90%
to complete the listing.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Regarding nitrites, here
are the comments that swung

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.770 align:middle line:90%
the scales.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Of the seven
contributions, six come

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:01.420 align:middle line:90%
from food industry lobbyists.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And with 31 pages, the
winner is Andrew Milkowski.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.930 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Before the interview, we show
Sam Delson all our documents

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.810 align:middle line:84%
on Milkowski, the
IARC Challenge,

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:18.612 align:middle line:90%
and the attempts at influence.

00:50:18.612 --> 00:50:21.990 align:middle line:90%


00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Faced with an avalanche of
proof gathered during months

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.300 align:middle line:84%
of investigation, he ends
up taking out his cell phone

However, in answering
our questions

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.000 align:middle line:90%
he seems less inspired.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.060 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:48.253 align:middle line:84%
>> We-- it's their business
if they think that they can

00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:84%
influence a decision
beyond the science,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.650 align:middle line:84%
but we let the science
do the talking.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it might
happen that sometimes you are

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.720 align:middle line:90%
manipulated by the industries?

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We do our best to make
decisions based solely

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:12.780 align:middle line:84%
on the science, regardless of
whatever pressure or attempts

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:18.030 align:middle line:84%
at persuasion may be made
by any outside group.

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> California will re-examine
the dangers of nitrites,

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.460 align:middle line:90%
but not before next year.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
For the lobby, it's a
mini-victory, time gained

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and profits not lost.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:37.620 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, a new
study on nitrite

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:90%
was expected in December 2015.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Almost a year later, it
still has not been published.
