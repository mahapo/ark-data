have a good relationship if I
just have a pause or a moment,

of that egoic consciousness.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%

is that you suffer less

professor emeritus of cognitive

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:84%
sciences at the University
of California at Irvine.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
My work has been teaching
students, although now I'm

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:90%
emeritus so I don't teach.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And now I do research.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I do research on right
now on consciousness,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
mathematical models
of consciousness,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and how physics
and spacetime might

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
arise from a theory
of consciousness

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that's completely
mathematically precise.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:10%
My own journey has been
both from the spiritual side

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:10%
and from the science side.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:10%
So my father was a minister,
a fundamentalist Christian

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:10%
minister.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So I got that on Sundays
and I got science at school

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and they conflicted.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
The stories I was getting
were contradictory.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And so as a teenager, I realized
I needed to figure things out

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
for myself.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And I decided the question
I wanted to answer was,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:90%
are we machines?

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Are people just machines or not?

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean from the
physicalist point of view,

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:90%
we would just be machines.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:84%
From a spiritual point of
view, we wouldn't be machines.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't precise enough
to say what we would be.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided to ask the
question scientifically,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:90%
are we just machines?

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I
thought to do that

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
would be to study
artificial intelligence.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to MIT and was
in the artificial intelligence

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
lab studying
artificial intelligence

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and also in what's now the
brain and cognitive science

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.573 align:middle line:84%
department studying the
human side of things

00:14:22.573 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:90%
because I wanted to do both.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see
what can machines do

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and what's special if
anything about humans

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.362 align:middle line:84%
and human neuroscience to
answer the very question,

00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
are the spiritual
traditions right?

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Are we more than just machines?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Or is the physicalist
scientific point

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
of view right and
we are just machines

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is just an
artifact of brain activity?

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The scientific materialist
paradigm that has been

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
predominant in the last
century denies the existence

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
of anything beyond the physical,
anything that cannot be

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
verified by the
scientific method.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Science is at an impasse.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It cannot move beyond the
paradox that is fundamental

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to quantum physics, which
brought it face to face with

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the observer, with
consciousness itself.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, religions
are, for the most part,

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
functioning only on
the level of belief.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:84%
They've lost their
original purpose,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
which was to lead to direct
experience of the truth of who

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and what we are.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:84%
The split between
science and spirituality

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:90%
has rendered both impoverished.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Religions and spiritual
systems desperately

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:84%
need rigorous methods, which can
be shown to create conditions

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:90%
for awakening to happen.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And science desperately
needs an openness

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility of
something beyond the physical.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
It is not about giving
up religion or science,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:84%
but about going deeper, being
willing to change ourselves,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.100 align:middle line:84%
so that we become a better
tool for investigation.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones doing the
experiment and the experiment

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Religion has been the
language and the container

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of these traditions
of meditation,

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
spirituality that have been
written down and passed

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:90%
on through the generations.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, certainly, there is some
language that is very literal,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
which divides religions
and divides cultures when

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%
things are taken literally.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel the
spirit of religion,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:84%
you can follow the thread
back to authentic awakening.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Anyone has the potential whether
they have belief or no belief

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:84%
because awakening is inherent
within our human consciousness

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:90%
just by our human birth.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you call it and
whatever language is used,

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
principles that

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:84%
seem to be the same throughout
these different religions,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and spiritualities, and
meditation traditions.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was younger, this
understanding was mainly

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:84%
available in the Eastern
spiritual traditions.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
It was available in
the Western traditions,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:84%
but it was so disguised and
codified in those traditions

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:90%
as to be almost inaccessible.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So many people of my generation
went physically or at least

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
intellectually to the East
to find this understanding.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And Eastern culture by
comparison with Western culture

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is exotic and so
this understanding

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
acquired a flavor of the
exotic from the cultures

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:90%
in which it was expressed.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And many people,
myself included,

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:84%
thought as a result
of this that there

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
was something exotic about
the non-dual understanding,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that it required some
extraordinary way of life.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You had to give up family
life, or grow your hair,

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:84%
or get a special
name, or subscribe

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of
teacher, or tradition,

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
or engage in strange practices,
all these kind of things which

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with
the core understanding.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were to
do with the culture

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
in which the understanding was
expressed at a particular time.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So now the understanding
has been completely

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
divested of the traditional
cultural packaging

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:84%
in which many of us
first heard about it.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And now just the
essential understanding

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
is available in a
way that enables

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
us to carry on leading our
lives exactly as they are,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:90%
family life, work life.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessary to make any
external changes in one's life.

>> The challenge we have on
this planet is that we think

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
there's more than one essence,
so we live in a world of what I

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
would call duality.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
There's male and female, black
and white, big and small, fast

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and slow, up and down,
here-there, before and after.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, there's
only one thing.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:90%
All things are one thing.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:90%
There is only one thing.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that when we
look deeply at everything,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
we see that here and there, big
and small, fast and slow, up

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and down, left and
right, male and female

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:84%
are all the same thing
simply expressing

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.190 align:middle line:84%
different characteristics,
but in no way separate

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all of us
are individuations of God.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I believe that God exists in as
in through every human being,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and for that matter, every
sentient being in the cosmos.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So I see then that I am,
in relationship to God,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
as a wave is to the ocean.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:84%
A wave is no different
from the ocean.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
It's simply an arising of
the ocean in individual form.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And when that
individuation is complete,

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the wave recedes back
into the ocean whence

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:84%
it came to arise
again on another day.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that we are
all individuations of divinity.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And when we see
everything as divine,

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
we change our relationship
with everything and everything

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
becomes different
in our experience.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.409 align:middle line:90%

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate reality
of the universe,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and everything and everyone
is obviously that, then how

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
come that the world appears
to us as a multiplicity

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and diversity of discrete and
independently existing people,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and animals, and things all
made out of stuff called matter?

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:84%
How can we reconcile
this statement

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
the ultimate reality

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
of the universe when it appears
as a multiplicity and diversity

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:90%
of objects made out of matter?

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So the evidence that
I'm using to suggest that

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:14.155 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is fundamental
has many aspects to it.

00:22:14.155 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:84%
One is that physics
itself says that spacetime

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:90%
isn't fundamental.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And evolutionary
theory also agrees

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that spacetime and
physical objects are not

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:90%
fundamental reality.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Now both of those
theories tell us only

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that, that spacetime
is not fundamental.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't tell us what
is beyond spacetime.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And so my argument is that
what the physicists are

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
finding beyond
spacetime, they're

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:90%
finding mathematical structures.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But what those are about
is not really clear

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
what is this realm
beyond spacetime about.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm proposing that
the realm beyond spacetime

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:90%
is about consciousness.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would suggest that
infinite consciousness has

00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:84%
the ability to localize itself
as numerous separate subjects

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
of experience that is all
sentient beings, all people,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:90%
all animals.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Each of us are localizations
of infinite consciousness

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:84%
in infinite consciousness, made
only of infinite consciousness,

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
from whose perspective
it views its own activity

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:90%
as the outside world.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So what appears to us
as a world made out

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
of matter from our
localized perspectives

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
is from the point
of view of reality

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
simply the activity of the
one infinite consciousness.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in
the ultimate analysis,

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
there are no discrete
or independently

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:90%
existing things or people.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:84%
There is one infinite,
indivisible whole,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:84%
the unity of being
that is only refracted

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
into an apparent multiplicity
and diversity of objects

00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and things when the one
looks at its own activity

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:84%
through the perceiving
faculties of the finite mind.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If we are awake, we realize
that there's one awareness that

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
is disguised as all of these
different beings on the planet,

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
one awareness shining through
everyone's eyes then we

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
literally see
ourselves in others.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And that tendency to operate
as an ego, the tendency

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to take for oneself falls
away because we directly

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:90%
realize the truth.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that we're
all one consciousness.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience of my
spiritual self was only

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
possible in the realm of the
physical for a very good reason

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
because only in the realm of
the physical was the opposite

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, just to
use a simple example,

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:84%
if I wanted to
experience myself--

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:84%
if I could speak
metaphorically--

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:84%
as the light, I couldn't
experience being the light

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:90%
if I was amidst the light.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else around
me but the light,

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
which is a perfect definition
of the realm of the spiritual.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So we'd come to a realm, which
I call the realm of the physical

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:84%
where there is something
other than the light.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if I want to experience
myself as the light--

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:84%
not just know myself as
that, but experience it--

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I could only do that where there
was the opposite of the light,

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:90%
in this case, the darkness.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So I brought myself
to the physical realm

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:84%
where the light and the
dark exist simultaneously.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And then in that outward
expression of myself

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
as the light, I could
be who I really am.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This understanding suggests
that behind our differences,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:90%
we are all the same being.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Not a similar being,
but we are all literally

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.600 align:middle line:90%
one, the same being.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And love is the felt experience
of this oneness or shared

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a theorem of our theory
that there is ultimately one

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have this dynamics of
many, many conscious agents,

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
but the theory tells
us that ultimately

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:84%
all those conscious agents
are really just projections

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:90%
of a single one consciousness.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:84%
The current paradigm
in science--

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and it has been
for centuries-- is

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that space and time are the
fundamental nature of reality.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.260 align:middle line:84%
They're irreducible and they are
the foundation of everything.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And prior to Einstein, space and
time were viewed as separate.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, space and time together
unified into spacetime

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
are viewed as the fundamental
nature of reality.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And science has then assumed
that spacetime and objects

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in spacetime are the
foundational reality.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example, when
we talk about consciousness,

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
consciousness itself then
must be somehow a product

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.280 align:middle line:90%
of objects in spacetime.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
In that physicalist
framework, space and time

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and physical objects
without any consciousness

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
are the fundamental
reality and consciousness

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
comes later on in the
evolution of the universe.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So that the Big Bang,
there was no consciousness,

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
there was just
spacetime and energy.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
The energy coalesced
into massive particles

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and eventually life emerged
after who knows how many

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
millions or hundreds of
millions or billions of years.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Then after that consciousness
came even later.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:84%
From that point of
view, when you die,

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the physical
complexity that gave

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.172 align:middle line:84%
rise to consciousness
dissolves and so

00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness dissolves.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the physicalist
framework really

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.500 align:middle line:84%
does eliminate consciousness
as a fundamental thing

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
all together and says
that when your body dies,

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness goes with it.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:84%
From this other
point of view, what

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I've done with my colleagues,
we used evolutionary theory

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.038 align:middle line:84%
to point out that
it's an implication

00:28:11.038 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of evolutionary theory
that space and time is not

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:90%
fundamental.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So the physicalist
interpretation of evolution

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:90%
is wrong.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
The idea that space and
time and particles somehow

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
have evolved to human organisms
is the wrong framework

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:84%
because spacetime itself
is not fundamental.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
We're positing a dynamics beyond
spacetime that's much richer,

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:90%
the dynamics of consciousness.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:84%
What we do not do is throw
away our old theories.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
When physicists say
spacetime was doomed,

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean we no longer
pay attention to Einstein,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:90%
absolutely not.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:90%
We pay attention to Einstein.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Any new theory beyond spacetime
that the physicists come up

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:84%
with better project
into spacetime

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and give us back Einstein and
it better give us back quantum

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:90%
theory or you're wrong.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So all of our old theories are
wonderful, wonderful friends

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to keep them
as special cases of a deeper

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So in our theory
of consciousness,

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:90%
we have to do the same thing.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.353 align:middle line:84%
We can't just propose
anything we want.

00:29:11.353 --> 00:29:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a theory
of consciousness that

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:84%
projects and gives
us back spacetime,

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and gives us back
quantum theory,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and gives us back special
and general relativity,

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us back evolution
by natural selection.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
If we cannot do that in
precise mathematical detail,

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:84%
then there is no reason for
scientists to take our theory

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness seriously.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as if infinite
consciousness puts on a virtual

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.940 align:middle line:84%
reality headset, infinite
consciousness puts on a VR

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
headset made of
thinking and perceiving.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, the moment
it puts on the VR headset,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.040 align:middle line:84%
it localizes itself
within its own activity.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And through that
headset, it looks out

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:84%
through the perceiving
faculties of a finite mind--

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.640 align:middle line:84%
seeing, hearing, touching,
tasting and smelling.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And it fragments the
unity of its own being

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and makes it appear
as 10,000 things.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
What I'm suggesting
is that there

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
is very much more to the
universe than the finite mind.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting that
the universe only appears

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:90%
in each of our finite minds.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.680 align:middle line:84%
The universe exists
outside of our finite mind,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.630 align:middle line:90%
but inside consciousness.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But it is the limitations
of our finite mind

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that give the universe
its appearance.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So when we look out
at the universe,

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing the reality that
exists prior to its being

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.880 align:middle line:90%
perceived.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But we are seeing
it through the lens

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
of our perceiving faculties,
which gives it its appearance.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So the idea of awakening in
many spiritual traditions has

00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:84%
been the idea that what
we have taken as reality--

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:84%
objects, and space and time, our
physical bodies, and so forth--

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.210 align:middle line:90%
is not the final reality.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
That there is a
much deeper reality,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.620 align:middle line:84%
a reality of consciousness
that transcends

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:84%
space and time and
physical objects

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and that we're not
divorced from that reality.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That reality is, in some sense,
the essence of what we are.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And so awakening is
awakening from the illusion

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just a little body
in space and time to the fact

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that I'm, in fact, the
author of everything

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I see inside of space and time.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.145 align:middle line:84%
I create it on the fly
as I look and perceive.

00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:38.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> One becomes awakened by
recognizing that what we

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:56.430 align:middle line:84%
essentially are is already fully
awake, fully aware, complete,

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:90%
whole, fulfilled, at peace.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like asking, how does
the sun become illuminated.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Its nature is light.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.750 align:middle line:90%
It is already fully illuminated.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:84%
The nature of our
essential being

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.790 align:middle line:90%
is already peace and happiness.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear to us all
because our essential being

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is so thoroughly mixed with
the content of experience

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that its innate peace
and happiness is

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.970 align:middle line:90%
dimmed by experience.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, we think
that our essential being

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:90%
needs to be enlightened.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
No, our essential
being doesn't need

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to be enlightened any more
than the sun needs to be lit up

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:90%
in the early morning.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The sun is always shining
with the same brightness.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Our essential being
is always shining

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.220 align:middle line:84%
with the same peace and
joy, but that peace and joy

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:84%
are dimmed by the agitation
and lack that characterizes

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.140 align:middle line:90%
our thoughts and feelings.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no
person that awakens.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So the I that
awakened, I awakened

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.780 align:middle line:84%
from this Dan structure
at a meditation center.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:90%
It was a zen center.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:84%
We were doing a
zen sesshin, which

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is a long period of
intensive practice.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So zen is amazing for creating
this container where there are

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:90%
these conditions of no escape.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So the Dan character that
had learned meditation,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:84%
the Dan character had been
doing all this meditation.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:39.940 align:middle line:84%
This doer of meditation realized
that it couldn't awaken.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like all the meditation
tricks, all the practices that

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
had been learned were of no use.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It got to the point
where that character

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:84%
who was trying to awaken failed
to awaken and had to fail.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The character that
I had been living,

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:84%
the character that I'd
been playing all my life

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:90%
had to let go or die.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And what was left when
that character-- when there

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:18.440 align:middle line:84%
was no doer, when there was no
meditator meditating or doing

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
something called
meditation, what was left

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
was my true nature
or me, just me.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When we awaken from this
small separate sense of self,

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
it's not that we're killing
the ego or we're fighting it.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, we're
allowing it to semi-retire

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:47.719 align:middle line:84%
from its job of ego
identity and then

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
relax to be part of our team,
part of our consciousness.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us a sense
of freedom immediately,

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:00.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're not looking at the
world through a small lens,

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that we're open-hearted and
open-minded in a way that's

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:12.740 align:middle line:84%
expansive and yet at the same
time more intimately connected.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Enlightenment is not
about becoming awakened.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Nobody becomes awakened
or enlightened.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a recognition of the
light, the light of pure knowing

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
whose nature is peace
and happiness that we

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.344 align:middle line:90%
always and already are.

00:35:28.344 --> 00:35:31.522 align:middle line:90%

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.920 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Lisa Natoli
and I'm known as a spiritual

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:10%
teacher.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:10%
I teach about healing, and
awakening, and transformation.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Awakening is the recognition
of your true nature

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's the realization
of what you really are,

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.940 align:middle line:90%
which is consciousness.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness is just
one word for many words

00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that people use for awareness,
life, love, God, light.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like waking up
to the recognition

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not this body, that
I am that which never dies

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.150 align:middle line:90%
and that which is never born.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest way
for me-- that was

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.260 align:middle line:90%
a very difficult idea for me.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I've been on a spiritual
path since 1992.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I started with a
course in miracles.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I studied it religiously.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was someone who was so
committed to knowing the self,

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.690 align:middle line:90%
knowing God, waking up.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get it because
I was under the belief

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
that awakening was
something mystical,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that something would happen,
that something would occur

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and it would be like
Jesus, or Buddha, or all

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of these enlightened masters.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't happening for me.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand
why am I so committed?

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having deep moments
of peace and happiness and joy

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and still struggling.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize the
simplicity of our true nature

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.800 align:middle line:90%
which is awareness.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So for someone who's
listening to me right now,

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:31.150 align:middle line:84%
the awareness that's hearing
this voice, that's what we are.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have a location,
it doesn't have a gender,

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have a color,
it doesn't have a body,

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's totally unlimited.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So awakening is where we
wake up to our true nature.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.820 align:middle line:84%
We wake up to the
realization that I

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:84%
am the awareness
of this experience

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.390 align:middle line:90%
right now as I'm here.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
ordinary, we miss it.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:84%
We think it can't
be that simple.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The recognition
of our true nature,

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't lead to happiness.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It is happiness.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:84%
The nature of being
is happiness itself

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.910 align:middle line:84%
for the recognition
of our true nature

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:90%
is the experience of happiness.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Who is aware in this moment?

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The mind will look for something
or try to complicate it.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You already are that which
the mind is looking for.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.900 align:middle line:84%
The mind will always
miss it, so don't

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.630 align:middle line:90%
look to the mind for an answer.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Don't push away your
thoughts and don't

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.000 align:middle line:90%
get caught in the thoughts.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Simply let go of the interest or
attachment to thoughts, ideas,

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.235 align:middle line:84%
Intend to directly
experience who you are.

00:39:08.235 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to negate the mind
or to achieve some state.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:21.160 align:middle line:84%
All doing, all
manipulation, all movement

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:90%
is more controlling by the mind.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.995 align:middle line:90%
Allow the mind to be as it is.

00:39:26.995 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes people can awaken
just in day-to-day life.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
need practice.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes things
will happen in life

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:48.060 align:middle line:84%
where there's an interrupt
in the pattern of you

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and there can be a
spontaneous awakening.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But if someone's life is just
going on in a robotic pattern

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:84%
or repetitive pattern, then
some sort of intervention

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:84%
is necessary if one is
called to awakening.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that interrupt
in the pattern view

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes called sadhana
or spiritual practice.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And these practices
are always conditioned.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:84%
They're something that we learn
with the conditioned mind,

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:84%
so they can make it more
likely for awakening

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to happen by loosening the
bonds within the self structure.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they say that
awakening happens by accident,

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.830 align:middle line:84%
but the practice makes

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The techniques,
the practices can

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.130 align:middle line:84%
be very useful to make
you more accident prone,

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:50.080 align:middle line:84%
but they, at a certain
point, have to be let go.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if the mind
is continuously

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.780 align:middle line:84%
doing some practice
or some thing,

00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:01.220 align:middle line:84%
then the mind has the reins, the
mind is in the driver's seat.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So the practices are very
useful as stepping stones

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:84%
for making the self structure,
you could say, less dense

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:84%
or lightening up
the self structure

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:19.405 align:middle line:84%
so that it becomes more
permeable to our true nature.

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:26.740 align:middle line:84%
The paradox with practice is
that when you finally awaken,

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.710 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
all of the practices

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:34.540 align:middle line:84%
were being done by the false
self, the character in the VR

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:41.500 align:middle line:84%
game, and that you, the
true self, was never bound.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is give up
the preferences of the ego,

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:84%
to give up the
fixation on things.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Anything within the field
of changing phenomena

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.046 align:middle line:90%
is not the true self.

00:41:56.046 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The you that you think you
are, the you that you've always

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:84%
been identified with
will never awaken.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.260 align:middle line:90%
You awaken from that character.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.230 align:middle line:84%
You awaken from the
delusion that you

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.950 align:middle line:90%
are this conditioned character.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So when people come to these
retreats, they think this I,

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
this little me is
going to awaken,

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:84%
some great thing
is going to happen.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain point, that
little me will never do it.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.330 align:middle line:90%
It has to give up.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It has to fail.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's only in that failure
we realize who we are,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that we've always been aware,
we've always been present.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:84%
We just got hooked
into this character

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.044 align:middle line:90%

search in the classical Advaita

Vedanta tradition, which was a
devotional path that involved

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:05.460 align:middle line:84%
mantra meditation, which I
practiced very diligently

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.990 align:middle line:90%
for 20 years.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:12.480 align:middle line:84%

focusing your attention

really when I came

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:29.560 align:middle line:84%
in touch with the direct path
that my spiritual search really

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:90%
reached its culmination.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Because in this
direct approach, we

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:40.270 align:middle line:84%
don't give our attention to
any object however subtle,

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:44.110 align:middle line:84%
for instance, a mantra,
a sound, the breath.

Awareness is like the screen.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It is like the space in
which all thoughts, motions,

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.350 align:middle line:84%
all states of
consciousness come and go.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:05.700 align:middle line:10%

If you act from the point
of view of the character,

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.630 align:middle line:84%
then you're caught
in the illusion.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:84%
To awaken, stop identifying
with what appears on the screen.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that it
is all impermanent.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Stop reacting to thoughts and
treating the program as real.

So we cannot initiate

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:49.750 align:middle line:84%
of my own awakening,
has really been

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:54.100 align:middle line:84%

for peace and happiness.

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:15.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's not
possible to be a separate self

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:19.220 align:middle line:84%
or to feel oneself
as a separate and not

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.330 align:middle line:90%
be in search of happiness.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So what is required,
in this case,

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:27.800 align:middle line:84%
is to reorientate one's
search for happiness

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.530 align:middle line:84%
instead of seeking for happiness
in the objective content

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:34.100 align:middle line:84%
of experience to seek
happiness in oneself.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual
practice that is required

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:42.740 align:middle line:84%
is to direct one's
attention or more accurately

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to relax one's attention into
its source, pure awareness,

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.680 align:middle line:84%
rather than directed towards
an object, substance, activity,

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.670 align:middle line:90%
relationship and so on.

00:49:55.670 --> 00:50:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual practice,
if we can call it a practice,

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:04.210 align:middle line:84%
would be this relaxing
of the attention,

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:10.840 align:middle line:84%
this subsidence of the attention
into the heart of awareness.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.650 align:middle line:90%

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and happiness for
which they long.

becomes the place

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:51.930 align:middle line:84%
in which they seek
happiness, seek fulfillment.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean to say that such
a person no longer has desires,

00:50:55.310 --> 00:51:00.800 align:middle line:84%
but the desires are not there to
fulfill the sense of lack that

is characteristic of
the separate self.

the source of happiness

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.640 align:middle line:84%

the experience of happiness

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Because our self stands at the

is we who are experiencing it.

everything and everyone are one.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So my feeling is that this

beyond spacetime will
give us technologies that

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.420 align:middle line:90%
will be truly mind boggling.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:47.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, right now,
most of the galaxies

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that we see, I think 97% of
the galaxies that we see, we

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:52.590 align:middle line:90%
can never go to.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:56.302 align:middle line:84%
They're receding from us
faster than the speed of light.

00:58:56.302 --> 00:58:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So that they're not moving
through space faster

00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.802 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of
light, space itself

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:03.982 align:middle line:84%

their speed moving away from us

00:59:03.982 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:84%
is greater than
the speed of light.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So we could never
travel through space

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:10.568 align:middle line:84%
to go to 97% of the
galaxies that we can see.

00:59:10.568 --> 00:59:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's all this real estate
out there that's waving at us

00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and saying, hi, we're out here

That's if you go

But what if you realize that
spacetime is just your headset?

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.970 align:middle line:90%

you're a wizard of
"Grand Theft Auto."

and you can beat
everybody in the game.

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.952 align:middle line:84%
But suppose you actually
know the software that

00:59:45.952 --> 00:59:48.410 align:middle line:84%
runs "Grand Theft Auto," so
you step outside of that "Grand

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:50.990 align:middle line:84%

can play with the software.

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can take the gasoline
out of the tank of the wizard,

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.558 align:middle line:84%
you can give them
a flat tire, you

00:59:56.558 --> 00:59:58.100 align:middle line:84%
can change the
geometry of the roads,

you can do whatever you want to.

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that we can reach critical
mass before our time runs out.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But we would be
mistaken if we think

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
we have an endless amount
of time on this planet.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> When each individual
disidentifies from

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:23.380 align:middle line:84%
their conditioned character,
then they're no longer acting

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.270 align:middle line:90%
as an egoic entity.

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And that brings about a
transformation on the planet.

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
This brings a new Earth.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> But life as we know it
right now on this planet,

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to make some
changes and make them quickly,

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
dramatically, and radically
if we want to see the tomorrow

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.690 align:middle line:90%
for which we've all dreamt.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So could this understanding
become mainstream

01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:49.580 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime?

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The challenge we have right
now is nothing is working.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And the time has come for us to
stand up and say that's true.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Surely, we can do
better than this.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Surely, we can expand our
understanding of who we are

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and our expression
of our true nature.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
We need to pay attention to our
environment, to our politics,

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to our economics, and
to our spiritual process

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
on this planet because the
problem in the world today

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is not a political problem,
it's not an economic problem,

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
it's not a social problem,
it's a spiritual problem.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:39.780 align:middle line:90%


01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
how committed we

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
are to stepping into the
highest spiritual truth.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
This is not New Age philosophy.

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
These ideas have been around
for thousands of years.

>> The perennial wisdom has
been expressed through countless

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
traditions and cultures and
like awareness itself has always

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.500 align:middle line:90%
been hidden in plain view.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity, the
Gnostic Gospel of Thomas

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
contains direct pointers
to our true nature.

The disciples asked Jesus
when will the Kingdom come?

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, "It will not
come by waiting for it.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
It will not be a matter of
saying here it is or there it

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.570 align:middle line:90%
is.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the Kingdom
of the Father

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is spread out upon the Earth
and people do not see it."

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
The Kingdom is
not here or there.

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is not here or there.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It is not fixed
in time and space.

If you are waiting for
something to happen,

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
for some outward event or
some state, some ascension,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.110 align:middle line:84%
some healing, or some energy,
then your conditioned mind

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.820 align:middle line:90%
is still seeking.

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It is still mediating your
experience of the now.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, they say Samsara,
the world of suffering,

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and Nirvana, the
world of liberation,

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:27.490 align:middle line:90%
are not two separate worlds.

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.620 align:middle line:90%
They are one and the same.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't manipulate
or change things

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.210 align:middle line:84%
to arrive at some
mystical reality.

When we awaken, the
perfection of the world
