00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>> 22 minutes past 9:00
this Thursday morning.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:90%
Very good to have you with us.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:90%
My next guest is David Icke.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
He's a former footballer
and sports broadcaster

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
who's now known as a
professional conspiracy

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:90%
theorist.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.327 align:middle line:84%
He describes himself as
a full-time investigative

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
journalist searching
for the truth of what's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:90%
really going on in the world.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
The author of over 20 books has
lectured in over 25 countries,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:84%
speaking for up to 10 hours to
audiences all over the world.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And he's preparing--
appearing, I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
should say-- in the
Helix in Dublin tomorrow

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:84%
night to talk about his book,
"Everything You Need to Know

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:90%
but Have Never Been Told."

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Dave, good morning.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, Ryan.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for coming
to see us today.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>> A pleasure.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Your talk tomorrow
in Dublin is sold out.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
They nearly all these days,
anywhere in the world.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
People will remember me as
the apparent nutter subjected

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:90%
to historic levels of ridicule.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think the mainstream
media, and people in general,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
thought that a corpse had
been left in the gutter,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But the corpse got up, started
walking, started running,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:90%
and now it's sprinting.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there's been this
enormous explosion of interest

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:90%
in my work in the last--

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%
well, particularly in the
last three or four years.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and gentlemen, can
you welcome onstage David Icke?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.114 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.394 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:46.394 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) One is the
loneliest number that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.732 align:middle line:90%
you'll ever do.

00:01:50.732 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you think there could be
other life other than humans?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I do, yeah.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You're the one
with a theory, not me.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.468 align:middle line:10%
>> You don't even know
what my theories are.

00:02:03.468 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't give them
any reason to believe in you,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
they will dismiss
you as a crank.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Because they're laughing at you.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.099 align:middle line:90%
They're not laughing with you.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Fine.

00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:17.889 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.464 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) Yes, it's the
saddest experience you'll ever

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:23.592 align:middle line:10%
know.

00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:90%
- I have to be stopped?

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.092 align:middle line:90%
>> To stop you telling ties.

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Answer the question.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> To stop you telling lies.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:90%
You're such a thick head.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> This is politics,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I know people put a
lot of work into conspiracy

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
theories, but I still think
they're actually intellectually

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:90%
lazy.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> My last book before the
present one is 1,000 pages.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Have you read any of my books?

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.715 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know that
it's intellectually lazy?

00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:51.548 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING) Number.

00:02:51.548 --> 00:02:55.034 align:middle line:10%
One is the loneliest number.

00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:59.018 align:middle line:10%
One is the loneliest number.

00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:05.492 align:middle line:10%
One is the loneliest
number that you ever do.

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Number one is the loneliest
number that you ever do.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.428 align:middle line:84%
Number one is the loneliest
number that you ever do.

00:03:21.428 --> 00:03:27.902 align:middle line:84%
Number one is the loneliest
number that you ever do.

00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Your story is extraordinary.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.995 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if we go
back to the beginning?

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think it's a
perfectly appropriate place

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:90%
to start.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember
watching you, when I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
was a kid, on the morning
television programs.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was born in Leicester
in the English Midlands

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:90%
in 1952.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It was what they call in
Britain a working class family.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
That just means we
never had any money.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a great childhood
because I didn't have phones,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have computers.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:90%
I just had the world to explore.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
My time as a kid was spent
playing football and watching

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:90%
steam trains, basically.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my
first day at school,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:90%
at little infant school.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.375 align:middle line:90%
I went to school in the morning.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:90%
My mother said I had to go.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
it was all about.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:90%
School?

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:90%
What's all that about?

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And at lunchtime,
I'd had enough,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
so I ran out at lunchtime
on the first day.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said to me mother,
no, I don't like that.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going back.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.602 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to go down to
the shops like we always do.

00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
you've got to go.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:90%
And so I had to go and stick it.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't a confident lad.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.618 align:middle line:84%
And the good things
in life always

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:90%
happened to other people.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
They weren't going
to happen to me.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:10%
Because when you were
brought up in a working class

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:10%
background in the
1950s and '60s,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:10%
you were pretty much going to
go off and work in a factory,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:10%
or you were going to work in an
office, or something like that.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But from the earliest age
when I realized these options,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I thought, I'm not doing them.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, just to the right here is
Leicester City Football Club.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a new ground now, but
it's right next to the old one.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
On Saturdays, I used to come
down here and watch Leicester

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:90%
City Football Club play.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I used to get in the ground,
one of the first people in so I

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.140 align:middle line:90%
could get right behind the goal.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:47.448 align:middle line:10%
And I watched Gordon Banks at
real close range for years.

00:05:47.448 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I learned
to become a goalkeeper--

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:90%
just watching him play.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, Leicester
City got interested in me

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
as a player when
I was in school.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I used to come down
here and train with them.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:84%
That shop over there,
that everyday shop

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:90%
used to be an electrical store.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And myself and Linda,
back in the-- what--

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
the 1970s-- used to live
up above that in the flats.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:90%
We used to rent it.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And it was so cold.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.345 align:middle line:84%
I used to go to bed every night
in the winter in an overcoat.

00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It was all we could
afford at the time.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:10%
I was working as a
journalist in Leicester

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:10%
at the local newspaper,
which didn't pay a lot.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> The Kube.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:90%
That's quite-- quite relevant.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I set out on a world speaking
tour in the summer of 2016

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
because I could feel that more
and more people were starting

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:90%
to feel uneasy about the world.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't like the
way it was going.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:90%
I just felt that there was--

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
there was an
ever-gathering number

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.663 align:middle line:84%
of people who would be open to
hearing maybe what is going on.

00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in the day, obviously,
it was a real battle to try

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and get anyone to
listen, to be honest.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
When Dad was doing
his talks, he was

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
talking to five, six,
seven people sometimes.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.233 align:middle line:84%
And in a theater
that held hundreds,

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
so it was probably quite an
embarrassing scenario, really.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:10%
>> There was nobody, hardly.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there was a really nice
group of people around David.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And when we used
to go and be part

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
of the talks and the
workshops, yeah, there

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.457 align:middle line:84%
was a man and a dog, quite
often, coming to these talks.

00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Putting out the chairs.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:90%
No one comes.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:10%
Putting back the chairs
and leaving poorer

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:10%
than when you arrived.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But you always had a sense
that something bigger was going

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- it was
tough back then.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm feeling--

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling quite
emotional tonight, really,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to think 60 years later,
60 fucking years later,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I keep getting
flashbacks of people at--

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:84%
people at school
that I remember,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and football games
that I played in,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.523 align:middle line:84%
and wondering where
they all are now.

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
They might be
somewhere out there.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a circle
completed, coming back here.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't really explain it.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:90%
I just feel very strange.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a special-- it's a
special moment for me.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
very special night.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.050 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:90%
- Cheers, folks.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and gentlemen, can
you welcome onstage David Icke?

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.459 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, back in Leicester
after all these years.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Bloody hell.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I love Leicester.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to think
that a snotty-nosed kid

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
on the Goodwood Estate with his
shirt hanging out all the time,

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
it seemed, and 60 years
later, he's standing here

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:90%
talking about this stuff.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Life's so funny
because you never

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
know where it's going
until you get there.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming more and
more of a challenge

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to find places to speak
without it being canceled.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to pay
tribute to my son, Jamie.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:90%
You've seen him-- the big lad--

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
who has this uncanny ability
to move the pieces around

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
so that when people trying to
silence me move a piece here,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:84%
then he says checkmate there
and somehow finds another venue.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to pay
tribute to him.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Every single event that we've
done anywhere in the world,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.653 align:middle line:84%
there's been certain groups
that have contacted venues,

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
made outrageous, libelous
claims about what Dave was going

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
to speak about,
and in many cases,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:90%
got venues to cancel on us.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> They tell the organizers that
I'm going to go on the stage,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to say a
stream of racist things,

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
none of which I've ever said,
none of which am I ever going

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:90%
to say.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:10%
What then happens, staggeringly,
is instead of coming to you

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:10%
and saying what these
people have said--

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.687 align:middle line:10%
you're going to say this,
you're going to say that--

00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:10%
what's going on--

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:10%
they pull the event.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:10%
And we hear about the
event we've been organizing

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:10%
for months being canceled--

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:10%
we hear about it in the media.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In Germany
alone, for example,

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I've been in touch
with over 70 venues,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and we've still never managed
to pull off a German show.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And there's a venue
that we had in Berlin,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:10%
which to this day, no
one in well over a year

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.560 align:middle line:10%
have never actually
contacted me to tell me

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:10%
the event has been canceled.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:10%
I found out from
a German newspaper

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:10%
when they published
a story about it.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:10%
>> And my website is blocked
in schools and universities

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:10%
and colleges.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:10%
It's blocked in government
departments and government

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:10%
agencies.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And here's me, one
person who was supposed

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:90%
to be this great nutter.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And the system is desperate to
silence what I'm putting out

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and to stop as many people
as possible ever hearing it.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.137 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I've agreed with the
government, because you

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.917 align:middle line:84%
know how I always do what
the government tells me.

00:11:45.917 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I've agreed with the government
and the mainstream media

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to issue this warning
before we start.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:90%
There are no conspiracies.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I want to make that clear.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:90%
There are no conspiracies.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
No one in the entirety
of human history

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
has ever conspired
with anyone else

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to bring about a
desired outcome.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Anyone who says so is a kook.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Except if you say
it's the Russians,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:90%
it's always true every time.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the big
things going on today,

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
so important in terms
of human freedom.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:84%
We have the new religion
of I am offended.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's about transitory,
illusory, irrelevant labels.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.842 align:middle line:84%
People get offended
about what people

00:12:32.842 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
say about their race, their
religion, their politics,

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
their gender, their culture,
all these labels, these labels

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:84%
that we give ourselves that
are not actually who we are.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:90%
They're what we're experiencing.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet these labels are
used to create offense

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.787 align:middle line:84%
and also the classic
divide and rule.

00:12:54.787 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We begin tonight
with that breaking news,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
a horrific scene in
Charlottesville, Virginia,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:84%
a white nationalist rally that
descended into deadly violence

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:90%
and chaos.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:10%
The hate boiling over,
white supremacists

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:10%
encountered protesters
fighting with fists and clubs.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:10%
Confederate flags
on full display,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:10%
the governor declaring
a state of emergency.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>> A car just plowed through
hundreds of people in downtown

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:10%
Charlottesville.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I am a man, woman, black,
white, Christian, Muslim,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Jewish, Hindu, middle class,
working class, name, age,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
and birth date.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I am my labels.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I am a label.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I have fallen into label
consciousness when all along,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the true self, the
true I, the infinite I,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that which leaves the body and
retains its consciousness--

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
indeed, expands its
consciousness as it leaves

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:90%
the body--

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:90%
filter, focus.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:84%
We are simply awareness,
a state of being aware.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:90%
What is race?

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Same consciousness,
different color vehicle.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%
What is sexuality?

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Same consciousness,
different experience.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not the color of our
skin that makes us different.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the color of our thoughts.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Or as Martin Luther King put it,
it's not the color of our skin.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:10%
It's the content
of our character.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And we can become so focused
on the five sense labels

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
that we cease to be
influenced by the vastness

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness beyond it.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
If we isolate ourselves-- and
this is what the system wants

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:90%
us to do--

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
with self-identity, only
with the experiences,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
then we don't let our minds
flow into the infinity

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
beyond this reality
and all that insight,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:84%
knowledge,
understanding, intuitive

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:90%
knowing that is kept from us.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the great keys
to human enslavement,

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:84%
individual and
collective, is to sell

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
the idea that your target
population is free,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.270 align:middle line:90%
the illusion of freedom.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Because people who
believe they are free

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
do not rebel about the
fact that they're not.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
The key to it all, however,
is slavery of the mind.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy called
Edward Bernays.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
He's still known today
as the father of PR,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:90%
what we would call now spin.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:84%
He said we are governed,
our minds are molded,

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
our tastes formed, our
ideas suggested largely

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:90%
by men we have never heard of.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
People are rarely aware
of the real reasons

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:90%
which motivate their actions.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
He called it the
invisible government.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It's that which
dictates perception.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I call it the program,
one big program.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what human life
is, if we allow it to be,

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:90%
from cradle to grave.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And I call this hoax, this
program, the postage stamp

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
consensus, which is what people
are downloading all their lives

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:90%
if they allow it to happen.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Get 'em early and
keep them for life.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:90%
You come out of the womb.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, immediately, you are
having your perceptions

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:90%
influenced by your parents--

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
not because they're bad people,
not because they're doing it

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:84%
malevolently, but they've
been through the process

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.418 align:middle line:84%
you're about to go through,
and they bought it.

00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
They think it's the right thing
to do to pass it on to you.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And then in a
ridiculously short time--

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.123 align:middle line:84%
what is it now,
three, four years?

00:16:32.123 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:90%
You've come out of the womb.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.910 align:middle line:84%
You've only just
bloody got here.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:10%
And now you're
sitting at a desk,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:10%
and an authority
figure representing

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.985 align:middle line:10%
the state is
telling you what is,

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:10%
what isn't, what's possible,
what's not possible,

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:10%
what has happened, what has
not happened, how things are,

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:10%
how things are not.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:10%
They're telling
you when you have

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:10%
to be there, when
you can leave, when

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:10%
you can eat, when you can talk,
when you can go to the toilet.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through
all your formative years

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:90%
downloading this program.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the postage stamp, and it
is a desperately limited range

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
of possibility which
runs science, which

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:84%
runs medicine, which
runs politics, which

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:90%
runs journalism, et cetera.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you stand on
the postage stamp,

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:90%
you live in the real world.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.272 align:middle line:90%
You're credible.

00:17:25.272 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But you step off
the postage stamp.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think
there's more to know

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:90%
than just that, you know?

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:90%
You're mad!

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:90%
You're mad!

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:90%
You're dangerous!

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:90%
You're all these things.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Stop these meetings.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the postage
stamp consensus

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is what holds us in perceptual
servitude all our lives

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:90%
if we allow it to.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And what is the postage
stamp consensus?

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hold on.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting something.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.797 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting something.

00:17:47.797 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yeah, it's bullshit.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The fewer choices you have,
the less freedom you have.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:10%
And the way the
system is structured,

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:10%
money dictates choice in the
great overwhelming vastness

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:10%
of human society.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- the
real reason why--

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
money is controlled as it is.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.302 align:middle line:90%
People say, oh, it's the greed.

00:18:11.302 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, on one level, it is.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But the real reason for the
control of money and finance

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:90%
globally is control.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:10%
Now the system says we have
the things you need to survive.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:10%
So what you do is
you do what we say.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:10%
You work as we say, and then
you will earn money from us

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:10%
for buying the things
that allow you to survive.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And you buy them by giving
that money back to us.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a conspiracy
to enslave all of us.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't come
together, it will happen.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.963 align:middle line:90%
If we do, it will not.

00:18:39.963 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Occupy Wall Street.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Occupy Wall Street.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Wall Street.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Wall Street.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Obviously, I've heard of it.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it on television.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever you have the
taxpayer trying to bail out

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
the elite investors, a small
group of elite investors,

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I think you have trouble.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:10%
>> What is the banking system
except almost the ultimate

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:10%
network of parasites feeding
off the efforts and the labor

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:10%
of the target population?

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And the whole banking system
is based on a gigantic hoax,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and that is you
lend people money

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't exist and
charge them interest on it.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Laws have been passed that
allow banks to lend massively

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:90%
more than they actually have.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
It's called fractional
reserve lending.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you go into a bank and
you ask for 100,000 pounds,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:84%
they type into your account
100,000 pounds of credit, which

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
is money that has never, does
not, and will never exist.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But you're not paying
back 100,000 pounds.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
You're paying back 100,000
pounds plus interest.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle line:90%
The interest is never created.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So at no point, on purpose, is
there even nearly enough money

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in circulation,
theoretical or otherwise,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
to pay back all the principle
of the debt and all the interest

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:90%
on the debt.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
In other words, people losing
their land, homes, resources,

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
everything is built into
the system on purpose.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:10.282 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I talk about

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:90%
is non-violent non-cooperation.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.740 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The few can't control the
many unless the many allow it.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.822 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking in
Croatia, in Zagreb.

00:20:20.822 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And someone said
to me, do you know

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.322 align:middle line:84%
there's a political party
here in parliament that

00:20:24.322 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:90%
was inspired by your work?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:90%
And of course, jaw dropped.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Ivan Pernar.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I am a member of
Croatian parliament.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen that
there are many policies

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that government execute
and people are opposed to.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I've wondered if it's
possible to create

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
a political party
which would reflect

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
popular opinion,
popular will, and not

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:84%
the will of this elite
establishment, so on.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided to
create my own party.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And our party name
is [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
It means like a living wall.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:84%
It came because they were
obstructing evictions

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
because the banks evict a lot of
people who can't pay off debt.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And we claim that in the current
debt-based monetary system,

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:90%
debt can't be repaid.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So they started ringing
houses that were about to be

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:84%
foreclosed, and the
bailiffs were coming,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
with people who just
wouldn't let it happen.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Are they streamed this
live on the internet,

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and they got a lot
of coverage and a lot

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:90%
of interest, a lot of support.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the greatest issue is
people not knowing how monetary

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:90%
system works.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
If they would know,
they would challenge it,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and everybody would
live much better off.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:10%
But of course, the
government does not

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:10%
want people to fight elite.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And in order to prevent them
from this kind of warfare,

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.045 align:middle line:84%
they need to divide
society within itself.

00:21:56.045 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:84%
You realize that there
is a whole awakening

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:90%
movement around the world.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw
what Icke is doing,

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:90%
I was a bit jealous on him.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, wow, look at
what this guy is doing.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could do
something like him.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But I knew I would never be a
world-known author or whatever.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And I then said, well, I
can't do what he's doing,

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
but I can challenge this
system against which

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.735 align:middle line:90%
he's speaking about locally.

00:22:37.735 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, we managed
to pass into parliament.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:84%
In a single year, we
almost tripled our support.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.900 align:middle line:90%
So there is exponential growth.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And other political parties,
they are falling down.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Because what the system wants
is this traditional division

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
of left, right,
center, whatever.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
In Croatia, we would say I'm
Croatian, you are a Serb,

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
or you're a Muslim,
I'm a Christian.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:90%
And we say, no, no, no.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:90%
We reject that division.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
We believe in division
between the top 1% and the 99%

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:84%
who are not at the
top and who are

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:84%
being pressured into
supporting the system which

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:90%
is working against them.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:90%
They're frightened of us.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:90%
People ask me, are you afraid?

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I say, no.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Because people don't
realize what's their power.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
that it's people

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.030 align:middle line:90%
who vote elected officials.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
They don't elect themselves.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So if people control
election process,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
if they participate
in it as voters,

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
they can decide who
will represent them,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and they can challenge it fully.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And it just
shows the potential.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:84%
If people will stop saying what
are they going to do about it

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and start saying what we
are going to do about it,

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
this political party in
Croatia shows what is possible.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
From the turn of 1989 when
I was in a room alone,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.210 align:middle line:84%
it felt like there
was something there--

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:90%
a presence, you might call it.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And this, through 1989,
got stronger and stronger

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and stronger and more
tangible until, in early 1990,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm with my son, Gareth,
who's a little boy then.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're on the
seafront in the town

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:84%
where I live next to a new
shop, and sold a few books.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And I walked in to
this shop where Gareth

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:90%
was looking at the books.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And as I turned to
say to him, come on,

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Gareth, we'll go and get some
lunch, the atmosphere around me

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And just a matter of two
or three weeks before,

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe even less,
I had been sitting

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:84%
in a hotel room in London when
I was working for the BBC.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And this presence was so
tangible, I actually said out

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.615 align:middle line:84%
into the room, would
you please contact me

00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:90%
if there's something there?

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you're driving
me up the wall.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And so shortly after that,
I'm in this new shop.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And the atmosphere
changed around me.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And I heard not a voice, but
a very strong thought form,

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
say to me, go and look at
the books on the far side.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So in a daze, I start
walking towards these books,

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:90%
and I got there.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And hid among these
novels was one book

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
with a woman's face on the
front called "Mind to Mind"

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:90%
by a woman called Betty Shine.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up because
it was different,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:90%
turned it over, read the blurb.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:84%
This lady is a
professional psychic,

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and this is her life story.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Immediately I saw
that blurb, I felt,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this
lady would pick up

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:84%
what I've been feeling
around me in the last year?

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.218 align:middle line:84%
So I read the book in 24 hours,
contacted her, went to see her.

00:26:10.218 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Didn't tell her anything.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
She reals her head back
and she said, my god.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I've got to close my
eyes for this one.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:90%
This is powerful.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And there I am sitting
there, in March, 1990.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And this lady starts telling me
what this presence in her mind

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.910 align:middle line:90%
is telling her to tell me--

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to go out on a
world stage and reveal great

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
secrets, that one man
cannot change the world,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
but one man can communicate
the message that can change

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
the world, that I was now
going out onto a world stage.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I would eventually
be world famous.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I would face
enormous opposition,

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:84%
but they would always
be there to protect me.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And what was going
to happen is they

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
were going to lead me to
knowledge, and at other times,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.950 align:middle line:84%
they were going to put
knowledge into my mind directly.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
From that time after I
left Betty Shine's house,

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%
my life became this incredible,
synchronistic journey

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of walking into
information, having

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
insight which later proved to
be correct by the unveiling

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.930 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And that has now gone on for
the last nearly 30 years.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But from about the turn of
the millennium, the key,

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:90%
the key thing came.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.557 align:middle line:84%
And that was an understanding
of what reality is.

00:27:38.557 --> 00:27:42.453 align:middle line:10%

[APPLAUSE]

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.506 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:54.306 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.360 align:middle line:90%
That's very kind.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.222 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:04.222 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll quit while I'm ahead.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Love to be back in Dublin, and
lovely to be back at the Helix.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The first one to
control perception

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is controlling the
perception of reality itself.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we don't
understand the very reality

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing and
interacting with, how can

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:90%
we understand anything?

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We live not in a world, but
in a band of frequency--

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:84%
actually, in a
band of information

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:90%
within that frequency.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But we are aware and
live within, in terms

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:84%
of our perception, a
tiny, tiny fraction of it.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:84%
This scene from "The Matrix"
is absolutely spot on.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:84%
">> Right now, we're
inside a computer program?

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it really so
hard to believe?

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Morpheus and Neo are in
a computer simulation akin

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And Neo said--

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> This-- this isn't real.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> This isn't real.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.220 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And Morpheus said--

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> What is real?

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:10%
How do you define real?

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about what you
can feel, what you can smell,

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.190 align:middle line:84%
what you can taste
and see, then real

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
is simply electrical signals
interpreted by your brain.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is all
this reality is.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> This reality is nothing
like we think it is.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Up to the 1920s,
mainstream science

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:03.560 align:middle line:84%
said there was one
galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Less than 100 years later,
the highest estimate

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:84%
is 2 trillion galaxies
in the universe.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
From 1 to 2 trillion
in less than 100 years?

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:84%
As Socrates in ancient Greece
is supposed to have said,

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
wisdom is knowing
how little we know.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Planet Earth is, by
comparison, the equivalent

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:90%
of a billionth of a pinhead.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Look into the night sky.

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Look at that blaze
of stars and lights.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you see everything
that exists in the space

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.708 align:middle line:90%
that you are looking at?

00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And most people would say,
yeah, well, of course, mate.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet that is not
even fractionally true.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:06.000 align:middle line:10%
According to mainstream science,
the electromagnetic spectrum

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:10%
is 0.005% of what exists
in the universe in energy

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:10%
and other forms.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:10%
But visible light, which
is the only frequency

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:10%
band that we can see, is a
tiny smear of the 0.005%.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:10%
Humans are basically
blind to what exists.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>> This could be
some simulation.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:41.590 align:middle line:10%
>> It could.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you entertain that?

00:31:42.632 --> 00:31:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the argument for
the simulation, I think,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.030 align:middle line:10%
is quite strong.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> This is real
when I touch that?

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It feels very real.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Where are you, really?

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.230 align:middle line:90%
You aren't anywhere.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.790 align:middle line:90%
You're in the computer.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.105 align:middle line:90%
>> What defines where you are?

00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, your
experience is clouded--

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think you are
where you are right now?

00:32:05.897 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:90%
You might not be.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll spark up a joint
if you keep talking.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.473 align:middle line:84%
Your manager is going
to come in here.

00:32:10.473 --> 00:32:11.910 align:middle line:90%
We might have to lock the door.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, you think
you're in a studio in LA.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I heard.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>> You might be in a computer.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We experience what is
apparently a physical world,

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:84%
a solid, physical world where
everything is apart from

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to be
outside of us, but it's not,

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:90%
not in the way we experience it.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:84%
The world out there that
we experience as out

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:90%
there is actually in here.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:90%
What is Wi-Fi?

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It's information carried
in radiation fields.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But you get a piece of
technology called a computer,

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and it will tap in to
those radiation fields,

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and it will decode them into
a form on the screen, which

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely nothing like the
field is in its prime form.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And we are doing exactly the
same to create the reality we

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:90%
think is so real.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We live in a sea of information,
of possibility, of probability,

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:90%
just like Wi-Fi.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And through what I call
the biological computer,

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:84%
the decoding processes
of what we call the body,

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:84%
we are decoding information
from that Wi-Fi field

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and putting it on our
screen, which exists in here.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:10%
When that construct
takes place, we

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:53.940 align:middle line:10%
perceive what we believe to be
an external world around us.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's only
going on in our heads.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Think of the air.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The air is taking vibrational
information that we call sound.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:10%
It's turning it into
electrical information.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.060 align:middle line:10%
It's communicating
it to the brain,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:10%
which then hears the sound.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no sound
passing between us.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We hear sound only
when we decode it.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:10%
As I speak now, my vocal cords
are creating a frequency field

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:10%
of information.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Only when you decode those words
in the way that I'm describing

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.219 align:middle line:84%
do you hear what
I'm actually saying.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be living in an
external world of solidity

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
when we're actually living
in a illusory world which,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:84%
in the decoded form,
is holographic.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:52.889 align:middle line:84%
>> When you see how close
virtual reality is now getting

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:54.620 align:middle line:84%
to the reality
we're experiencing--

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and the people at the cutting
edge of this field say it

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:84%
won't be many years before
you won't be able to know

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.290 align:middle line:90%
the difference.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.252 align:middle line:90%
>> We have that HTC Vive here.

00:35:03.252 --> 00:35:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've only done it a
couple times, quite honestly,

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.835 align:middle line:84%
because it kind
of freaks me out.

00:35:06.835 --> 00:35:08.970 align:middle line:90%
My kids fucking love it, man.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.030 align:middle line:10%
They love playing
these weirdo games

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.670 align:middle line:10%
and walking around
with that headset on.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.010 align:middle line:84%
But part of me watching
them do it goes, wow,

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this is the
precursor to, like--

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.728 align:middle line:84%
if you look at that phone that
Gordon Gecko had on the beach,

00:35:23.728 --> 00:35:24.645 align:middle line:90%
and you compare that--

00:35:24.645 --> 00:35:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, big cell phone.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You compare that
to a Galaxy Note 9,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:84%
how the fuck did
that become that?

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder, when I
see this HTC Vive--

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what is that thing
going to be 10 years from now

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.710 align:middle line:84%
when we're making fun
of what it is now?

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:10%
What is it-- how--

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:10%
how ingrained, and how
connected and interconnected

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.815 align:middle line:10%
is this technology
going to be in our life?

00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It will be, at some point,
indistinguishable from reality.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> How do they manifest
these virtual realities?

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.760 align:middle line:84%
By using exactly the same
systems of decoding that

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:90%
we used to create this one.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:13.080 align:middle line:84%
The gloves hack in
to the touch sensors.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:10%
The headsets hack in
to the sight sensors

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.100 align:middle line:10%
and to the ear sensors.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:10%
And so what these
games are doing

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:10%
is they are hacking in,
with an alternative source

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:10%
of information, into
these decoding senses

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:10%
that we use to
create this reality.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And it can appear to
be so incredibly real.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.530 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see people react
to what is merely information

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.045 align:middle line:90%
being fed to their senses.

00:36:45.045 --> 00:36:48.762 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.762 --> 00:36:51.678 align:middle line:90%
[SCREAMING]

00:36:51.678 --> 00:36:54.594 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.594 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:84%
The physics of computer games
and the physics of our reality

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:90%
are basically the same.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:07.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a revolution,
and its time has come.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:08.668 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:37:08.668 --> 00:37:11.660 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.152 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.597 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.597 --> 00:37:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It's fantastic when
you get out there,

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:84%
because you're just going
through an energy field,

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and it's like--

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.740 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
a state of bliss.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I was saying all these
years that if what you say has

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:84%
validity, it will eventually
be shown to be so.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And people are now coming to my
work in ever-gathering numbers

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.020 align:middle line:84%
because of what
I've said way back.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So I say to people,
speak your truth.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:84%
The most astounding experience
I've had in all this

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:84%
nearly 30 years came after
I'd seen Betty Shine,

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and then I wrote a book through
that next few months called

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.520 align:middle line:90%
"Truth Vibrations."

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And something intuitively,
which is how I

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:20.644 align:middle line:90%
started to operate after--

00:38:20.644 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:90%
after this whole thing started--

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:90%
said you've got to Peru.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.230 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go to Peru.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:30.490 align:middle line:10%
And I ended up at a place
called [INAUDIBLE] not far

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:10%
from Puno on the shores of Lake
Titicaca, the highest navigable

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.620 align:middle line:10%
lake in the world.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I walk up to the
top of this hill,

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and there's these
stones and stuff.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I walk in
among these stones.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard, just like
in the new shop, not a voice,

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:90%
but a strong thought form.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It said, they'll be talking
about this 100 years from now.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It will be over when
you feel the rain.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Cloudless sky,
piercing Peruvian sun.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It will be over when
you feel the rain.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Icke, you're going mad.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And out of the mountains
came this storm.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I'm watching
this wall of stair rod

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:90%
rain moved towards me.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.540 align:middle line:84%
What happened is this
energy coming through me

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:84%
got more and more powerful, like
being plugged into the mains.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.060 align:middle line:90%
And then the rain hit me.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I was deluged in a second.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.750 align:middle line:90%
And the energy stopped.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And I staggered
forward like Bambi.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And something phenomenal
had happened in that moment,

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was like,
when I look back,

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:84%
being in a bubble of
perception all your life,

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and then someone comes
along-- no warning--

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:90%
bursts the bubble.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And concepts, insights,
knowledge, awareness

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:84%
was pouring into
my conscious mind.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was like someone pressing
too many keys on a computer.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.570 align:middle line:84%
The computer can't
process the information

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.470 align:middle line:90%
because there's too much.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
went into a period--

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:90%
only lasted three months--

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.630 align:middle line:84%
where I didn't know what I
was doing, or where I was,

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:90%
or what was going on.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, 1991,
it just went, bang.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I came back from
Peru to Britain.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And the book came out,
"Truth Vibrations."

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was invited onto
a massively popular talk

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:84%
show, early evening
on the BBC, called

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:84%
"The Wogan Show"
fronted by a guy called

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Terry Wogan, an Irish guy.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>> According to his book,
"The Truth Vibrations,"

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.750 align:middle line:84%
the world as we know
it is about to end.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:90%
David Icke.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember this very clearly.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.590 align:middle line:84%
17 million people, I
think, was the audience.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:07.157 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely massive.

00:41:07.157 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting there.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.570 align:middle line:90%
The audience were laughing.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> They're laughing at you.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.282 align:middle line:90%
They're not laughing with you.

00:41:14.282 --> 00:41:15.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Fine.

00:41:15.214 --> 00:41:18.476 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:19.410 align:middle line:90%


00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>> David Icke, the person
who had been the one that I

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
identified with up to that
point, was dying 1,000 deaths.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, he's
going to get--

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was thinking to
myself, my life's over.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Why should I impose my will?

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Why should I try to impose
what I'm saying on anyone?

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They have the right to
listen to what I'm saying,

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.037 align:middle line:84%
to listen to what
the traditional--

00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't give
them any kind of proof,

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.820 align:middle line:84%
if you don't give them any
reason to believe in you,

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:84%
they will dismiss
you as a crank,

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.220 align:middle line:90%
which is what they're doing.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's their
free will choice.

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But then, of course, the
press just had a field day.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:90%
We were ridiculed beyond belief.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Press camped outside the
house, followed us on holidays,

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.270 align:middle line:90%
followed the kids from school.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Primary school, Dad was like
a hero, like BBC presenter,

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:12.620 align:middle line:90%
massive--

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:84%
all the kids would want
to play around the house.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And then literally like
that, it was all of a sudden,

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
kids won't come around
anymore, or they-- my Ravi

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:84%
didn't play with him because
his dad's a bit-- you know.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I live my life to the sound
of laughter, distant laughter,

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.885 align:middle line:90%
sometimes in-my-face laughter.

00:42:32.885 --> 00:42:35.645 align:middle line:84%
You know that Icke
guy who's gone crazy?

00:42:35.645 --> 00:42:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just amazing.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Horrible time.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't wish it on anybody
to go and sit in a restaurant

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:84%
somewhere and have people, whole
families pointing and laughing.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Going into a pub, forget it.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.300 align:middle line:90%
There was uproar.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And I went into this period
of absolutely historic levels

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.030 align:middle line:90%
of ridicule.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I have this phrase I've
written in the books.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Life so often gives
you your greatest gift

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.560 align:middle line:84%
brilliantly disguised
as your worst nightmare.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And mass ridicule on
that historic scale

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:19.610 align:middle line:84%
in the face of it was a worst
nightmare, but it set me free.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And what was that freedom?

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It was the freedom from fearing
or being concerned by what

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:90%
other people think of you.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:35.850 align:middle line:10%
We are in a period now
where speaking your truth

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:42.630 align:middle line:10%
and not being intimidated into
silence is not just important.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:49.410 align:middle line:10%
It's utterly crucial to where
humanity goes from here.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If I had not have gone through
that extraordinarily, extreme

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.900 align:middle line:84%
experience and let go
of this concern of what

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.450 align:middle line:84%
other people think,
does anybody think

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I would have talked
and written about some

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.440 align:middle line:90%
of the things I have since?

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.020 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.340 align:middle line:90%
You don't accept it?

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Don't accept it.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.332 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:44:11.332 --> 00:44:13.082 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going
to stop me saying it.

00:44:13.082 --> 00:44:16.250 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:20.060 align:middle line:84%
One of my great
surprises over the years

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:84%
was to read in a newspaper
about a program, a radio

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:84%
program in Britain that's been
running a very, very long time

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
called "Desert Island Discs."

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> My castaway this week is the
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Alice Walker.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And when she was asked
what book would you take

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:90%
to the desert island, she said--

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like to take "Human
Race, Get Off Your Knees"

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.410 align:middle line:90%
by David Icke.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> She said, when I met
her, there was this silence.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Did she just say a
book by David Icke?

00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I met her and spent hours with
her at her home in California.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the most
memorable days of my life.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you?

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:45:08.155 --> 00:45:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Delighted to have time
to talk to you this time.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I think David Icke
is a great teacher.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's really
the right teacher for now

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.820 align:middle line:90%
because he's so present.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I've seen the view.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.768 align:middle line:84%
I do not understand
why you live here.

00:45:25.768 --> 00:45:26.810 align:middle line:90%
What makes you live here?

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> You should live
in downtown LA.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know, tough.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Come on in.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.623 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:45:36.623 --> 00:45:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:40.624 align:middle line:90%
>> You look incredible.

00:45:40.624 --> 00:45:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> You do.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>> You look incredible.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Goodness.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.040 align:middle line:90%
That helps.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy that
you could come.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to show you
our part of the world.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And this part right here
has been very comforting,

00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and it has a feeling
of safety for me.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's got a great
calmness about it.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.927 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, I was thinking about
some of the similarities that

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:06.620 align:middle line:90%
we share.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:07.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Really?

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.800 align:middle line:10%
>> And I was writing this
book called "The Temple

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:10%
of my Familiar."

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, the
synchronicities

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.640 align:middle line:90%
were just, like, all the time.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Living here, it supported that.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.130 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's one
of my earliest connections

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to your work and feeling
supported by similar energies.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So I felt comfortable with
your work in a way that most

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:84%
people-- many people up until
recently have not seemed

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.305 align:middle line:90%
to be--

00:46:39.305 --> 00:46:40.280 align:middle line:90%
- No, comfortable.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> We have the same car.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>> We have the same color.

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.390 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Even the same color.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.510 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Both sides of the
Atlantic, same car.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if anybody else
could do it but him, actually.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.900 align:middle line:84%
He somehow has all
the qualifications

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:07.210 align:middle line:84%
for presenting it with enough
nerve, just sheer nerve.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Something in the energetic
field around you that you never

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.400 align:middle line:90%
feel alone.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There's always
some support there.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what drove me on
when everyone else was saying

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:25.590 align:middle line:90%
crazy, and this is nonsense.

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my Aquarian
spirit helps me there,

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.500 align:middle line:90%
because I've been trashed a lot.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But I have this
ability to just keep

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.540 align:middle line:90%
going and feel that support.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.190 align:middle line:84%
From the time I was a child,
we lived way in the country,

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and we were very poor.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And I used to have a stick
that I would walk along

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the fence with, just
making what music

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I could out of the
sound of the stick

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.000 align:middle line:84%
on the fence in
perfect happiness,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:84%
because I felt all around
me that I was supported.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>> What I've found--

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:90%
if a person just accepts--

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:03.670 align:middle line:84%
well, actually, that I
wasn't told the truth, was I?

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.020 align:middle line:90%
The next question is, well--

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What else am I
being lied about?

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>> What else am I not
being told that's not true?

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:09.490 align:middle line:90%
And the dominoes start to fall.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I see that a lot.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.650 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we need him
as a teacher because some

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:22.750 align:middle line:84%
of the subject matter is
so strange to most people,

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:26.980 align:middle line:84%
strange just mainly because
they're not used to thinking

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.600 align:middle line:84%
outside of a certain
box, if you will.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I came across these other
explanations for reality.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd been a professional
footballer.

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.180 align:middle line:90%
I'd been a journalist.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I'd been a radio reporter.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:43.870 align:middle line:90%
I'd been on television.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd been in politics
in the Green Party.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:49.275 align:middle line:84%
I had lived quite
an expansive life.

00:48:49.275 --> 00:48:51.751 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard of it.

00:48:51.751 --> 00:48:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And my first question,
which actually

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:84%
started to lead me
into the conspiracy,

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.410 align:middle line:84%
was, why isn't this
taught in schools?

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:03.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the stadium in which
this whole human society

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:09.440 align:middle line:84%
is played out, keeping humanity
in ignorance of itself.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So we can be used.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:84%
If I've ever met a spiritual
soulmate in terms of the way

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.090 align:middle line:84%
we see the world, then
it's Alice Walker.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:26.860 align:middle line:84%
She's just an incredible
example of someone

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:33.350 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't just believe
something, but lives it.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And all these years
later, she's still there,

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.100 align:middle line:84%
still driving on, still
challenging imposition

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.510 align:middle line:90%
and challenging injustice.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was an absolute joy
to spend time with her.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's not the last
time that we ever meet.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I love his mind.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:50:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think for people
who enjoy exploring

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.980 align:middle line:84%
the nature of reality and
unreality, what he teaches

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.380 align:middle line:90%
is very intriguing.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I, for one, am just
deeply grateful.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.290 align:middle line:90%
I feel I've learned so much.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:18.465 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me feel more
at home in the mystery.

00:50:18.465 --> 00:50:25.160 align:middle line:90%


00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> If you keep going,
and you don't give up,

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and you don't apologize
for being you,

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and if what you
say has validity,

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.210 align:middle line:84%
then eventually it
will come together.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:37.340 align:middle line:90%
But if you don't--

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.400 align:middle line:84%
if you don't keep
going when all seems

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
lost, when it seems
that it's going nowhere,

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's all a
struggle, and the times

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:84%
when the waters break and
the clouds open never comes--

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:56.927 align:middle line:90%
no one said it would be easy.

00:50:56.927 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:01.115 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:01.115 --> 00:51:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.300 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just incredible how
many people are here tonight,

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.830 align:middle line:84%
because this was only
thought of about--

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:14.630 align:middle line:90%
what, a month ago?

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But the interest
now is incredible.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're
trying to shut me up.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes more difficult to
find a venue big enough for all

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.370 align:middle line:90%
the people that want to come.

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And what this evening
is about is context.

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.180 align:middle line:84%
This is what is absolutely
missing, not least

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.620 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream media--

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.480 align:middle line:90%
context.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.070 align:middle line:84%
If you look at people,
organizations, happenings,

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:49.700 align:middle line:84%
world events in isolation,
they look a certain way.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But you put them in context,
how they connect together

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.810 align:middle line:90%
to a common direction, and whoa.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.600 align:middle line:84%
The world looks very,
very, very different.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.230 align:middle line:84%
The key is why
they are happening.

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:07.490 align:middle line:84%
The why is what
opens the vista up.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.790 align:middle line:10%
The idea of the postage
stamp is to keep

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:15.440 align:middle line:10%
us seeing only the
pieces, never the picture.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But connect the dots between
these organizations, people,

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:84%
world events, happenings,
and suddenly, ah,

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.630 align:middle line:90%
so that's what's going on.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:84%
This world of the seen
is being manipulated

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:37.130 align:middle line:84%
from the unseen, which is
almost the entirety of existence

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.630 align:middle line:90%
that we can't see.

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:43.820 align:middle line:84%
People can say we are free, and
to them, it may seem like it--

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.033 align:middle line:84%
being able to vote for
someone every four or five

00:52:46.033 --> 00:52:47.450 align:middle line:84%
years who then
does what they like

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.540 align:middle line:84%
until they get the
chance to vote again

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.870 align:middle line:90%
four or five years later.

00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It's called freedom.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is to not
let us see the bars

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and not let us see the
walls of the prison.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.350 align:middle line:84%
What they want to do
is to make sure we

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:07.550 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's going
on, but that we don't know

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:11.360 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what's going on.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.210 align:middle line:84%
How it works is
you've got a spider

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:16.880 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the
web, and then you've

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:84%
got these strands immediately
around the spider.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.520 align:middle line:90%
All this is in the unseen.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And these secret societies,
symbolized by those strands,

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:29.690 align:middle line:84%
are the most secretive,
the most exclusive.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of them don't
even have names,

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:90%
so they're harder to uncover.

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And then as you come
out from the spider,

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.893 align:middle line:10%
still in the hidden, you
meet the secret societies

00:53:38.893 --> 00:53:41.060 align:middle line:10%
we do know about, like the
Freemasons or the Knights

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.240 align:middle line:10%
Templar and the Knights
of Malta and Opus Dei

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.770 align:middle line:10%
and the inner circle of the
Jesuit Order and others.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Now we hit the world that we
see, the world of governments

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and banking systems and
corporations and government

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.430 align:middle line:90%
agencies.

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we
think that the decisions

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that are dictating to our lives
are being made by those people.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.190 align:middle line:84%
In the end, if you go deep
enough or high enough,

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:13.700 align:middle line:84%
whichever symbol you
want, you hit this force.

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But the vast
overwhelming majority

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.590 align:middle line:84%
of people in these
areas of society

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:22.550 align:middle line:84%
have no idea that that's the
case because of something

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.290 align:middle line:90%
called compartmentalization.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, only a few at
the top know the big picture.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:10%
Everyone else only
knows a part of it.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.160 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you get
some blokes in suits,

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and you plunk a head on them,
and you call them Republican,

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.170 align:middle line:90%
or you call them Democrat.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:42.500 align:middle line:84%
These are the here today,
gone tomorrow politicians

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.620 align:middle line:90%
that are basically irrelevant.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Republican
Party, for instance, there's

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.460 align:middle line:84%
a group of people in the
background called the neocons

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:56.350 align:middle line:84%
or neoconservatives, and they
control the Republican Party.

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:58.100 align:middle line:10%
And they control the
Republican president.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.230 align:middle line:90%
They're controlling Trump now.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.640 align:middle line:90%
In the Democratic Party.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.200 align:middle line:84%
you've got another
group of people.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I call them the Democons.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And they control the
Democratic Party and whoever's

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.350 align:middle line:90%
in the presidency.

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:13.520 align:middle line:84%
They are the next stage
back into the hidden answer

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:90%
to the same force.

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So whoever the here today,
gone tomorrow politician is,

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:90%
that is always in control.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's known by some as
the permanent government.

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.610 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, nothing changes.

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you vote for, the
same direction of society

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:35.330 align:middle line:84%
continues, because the
people you're looking at

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.340 align:middle line:90%
are not the ones in control.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you see these
people that come to power,

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.000 align:middle line:84%
they don't come to
power by accident.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.540 align:middle line:90%
They come to power by design.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:47.240 align:middle line:84%
The money, the media
coverage, all of that

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:52.700 align:middle line:84%
goes to put them into
power to serve this web.

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.680 align:middle line:10%
Some of them know a lot
about what's happening.

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.020 align:middle line:10%
A lot of them know some
of what's happening,

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.430 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of them know nothing.

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:04.940 align:middle line:84%
They're just malleable people
who will sign the right paper

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:09.470 align:middle line:84%
or push the right policy on
behalf of that in the hidden.

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And yet if you don't know
that-- and most people don't--

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:18.410 align:middle line:84%
then you have people
divided and ruled,

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:21.920 align:middle line:84%
fighting each other over which
here today, gone tomorrow

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.390 align:middle line:90%
politician is the right one.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And the hidden hand is
laughing its pants off

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.920 align:middle line:84%
because that's exactly what
they want-- divide and rule.

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:36.332 align:middle line:90%


00:56:36.332 --> 00:56:40.268 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:56:40.268 --> 00:57:01.440 align:middle line:90%


00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.680 align:middle line:90%
A Routemaster bus.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Good afternoon.

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I know some people have
come from long distances.

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is the alternative
tour over London.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:25.950 align:middle line:84%
In America in particular
now, the term "deep state"

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:29.220 align:middle line:90%
is almost common parlance.

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.640 align:middle line:84%
This hidden government, this
global hidden government

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.450 align:middle line:90%
is always there.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
censors of that is London.

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Down there is Downing
Street, of course,

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.490 align:middle line:90%
and the Ministry of Defense.

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And Downing Street
is another location

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.630 align:middle line:84%
for here today, gone
tomorrow politicians.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Theresa.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Are you all right?

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Bank
of England where

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.500 align:middle line:84%
they lend people money
that doesn't exist

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and charge them interest on it.

00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:01.390 align:middle line:84%
It's called organized crime
in any other profession,

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.280 align:middle line:90%
but in banking, it's legal.

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:10.440 align:middle line:84%
We're heading round now
towards Buckingham Palace.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of extraordinary
when you think about it,

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that we think now that we're
in a modern, advanced, mature

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.100 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:28.240 align:middle line:10%
But Britain, and indeed, the
countries of the Commonwealth,

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:33.700 align:middle line:10%
have their head of state chosen,
to bring it down to basics,

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:37.060 align:middle line:10%
by who had sex with
who in what order.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.860 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:44.550 align:middle line:84%
That's how we choose who is the
head of state in this country.

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:46.530 align:middle line:90%
They're in awe of them.

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:49.680 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to turn
your back on the queen.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.770 align:middle line:90%
You have to back out the room.

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's the queen.

00:58:53.940 --> 00:59:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But do we ever ask
why is she queen?

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:06.900 align:middle line:84%
This royal phenomenon is
an in-your-face example

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:11.160 align:middle line:90%
of what is called today the 1%.

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Over to the left
is the place where

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:19.650 align:middle line:84%
most people think this
country is run from,

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.440 align:middle line:90%
the houses of Parliament.

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.150 align:middle line:10%
And if you can
get the population

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:29.040 align:middle line:10%
to focus in the wrong place
where the decisions are being

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.190 align:middle line:10%
made, but that aren't,
really, then you're

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:36.230 align:middle line:10%
not going to get
people to see where

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:38.480 align:middle line:10%
the power and the
direction of the world

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.810 align:middle line:10%
is being controlled from.

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And here we have, to the right,
on the other side of the river,

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.490 align:middle line:90%
the Tower of London.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:48.140 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll end up there one day.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:53.918 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, no probs.

00:59:53.918 --> 00:59:57.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:59:57.212 --> 00:59:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the world is
going in the wrong direction.

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's only him
maybe talking about it,

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.590 align:middle line:84%
so it was really interesting
to see it from firsthand.

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.407 align:middle line:84%
>> At least he's giving truths
out there that plant a seed.

01:00:09.407 --> 01:00:11.615 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the seed
needs to do-- plant and grow

01:00:11.615 --> 01:00:14.270 align:middle line:84%
so everybody knows
the truth of it.

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>> People don't seem to
reject him as much anymore.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.990 align:middle line:90%
They open up.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:24.062 align:middle line:84%
I'm thankful for that,
gratefully, yeah.

01:00:24.062 --> 01:00:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and the good thing
about him is he knows how

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:30.700 align:middle line:84%
to laugh at himself, which I
think is something that a lot

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of our politicians could
learn a lesson from.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:39.840 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> A quick series a dot connects
to bring us to present day.

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:44.910 align:middle line:90%
Show you how this works.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:47.012 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, a
group was created

01:00:47.012 --> 01:00:49.470 align:middle line:84%
in America called The Project
for the New American Century.

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It was a neocon organization,
the one behind the Republican

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Party.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It was co-founded by Robert
Kagan and William Kristol.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.960 align:middle line:10%
And in it was Dick Cheney, who
would become de facto president

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.170 align:middle line:10%
with Bush, Rumsfeld,
who would be

01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:10.410 align:middle line:10%
head of the Pentagon,
the Defense Department.

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:13.170 align:middle line:84%
His deputy, Wolfowitz,
Dov Zakheim,

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
who controlled the entire
budget of the Pentagon,

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
his comptroller, and this
man, John Bolton, who's

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.060 align:middle line:84%
never seen a country
he didn't want to bomb.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:26.140 align:middle line:10%
And in September, 2000, this
lot produced a document.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.960 align:middle line:10%
In this document, they
called for American forces

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:33.310 align:middle line:10%
to fight and decisively win
multiple simultaneous major

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:34.840 align:middle line:10%
theater wars.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
They named the countries--

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Iraq, Libya, Syria, Lebanon,
Iran, North Korea, China.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Nothing changes a status
quo quicker or more

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.750 align:middle line:90%
permanently than a war.

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:50.440 align:middle line:90%
So status quo-- you have a war.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.810 align:middle line:84%
New status quo-- you
have another war.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.180 align:middle line:90%
New status quo.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And each one's taking
you nearer and nearer

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
to your goal, which is the
global centralization of power.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you
know that want a war?

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Hardly anybody, but we
have them all the time--

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
war after war after
war after war.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's this web that
is driving these wars.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.370 align:middle line:84%
This is why there is
always money for war--

01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
because the web is deciding
what governments spend money on,

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.950 align:middle line:90%
and they want the war.

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:26.320 align:middle line:10%
So no one ever says,
we can't go to war.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.970 align:middle line:10%
We can't afford it.

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:31.630 align:middle line:10%
General Wesley Clark, former
NATO Supreme Allied Commander,

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:34.690 align:middle line:10%
he was interviewed in 2007.

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:38.410 align:middle line:10%
And he said that
immediately after 9/11, he

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:41.380 align:middle line:10%
went to the Pentagon and was
told by a general friend of his

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.630 align:middle line:10%
in the so-called
Joint Chiefs of Staff

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:48.910 align:middle line:10%
that the decision had
been made that America

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:51.130 align:middle line:10%
was going to invade seven
countries in five years.

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:53.378 align:middle line:84%
And the countries he
named were the countries

01:02:53.378 --> 01:02:55.420 align:middle line:84%
named by the Project for
the New American Century

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.455 align:middle line:90%
in September, 2000.

01:02:57.455 --> 01:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>> About 10 days after 9/11,
I went through the Pentagon,

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld
and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I went downstairs
just to say hello

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:08.417 align:middle line:84%
to some of the people
on the joint staff who

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
used to work for me.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
generals called me,

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and he said, sir,
you've got to come in.

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
You've got to come in
and talk to me a second.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, you're too busy.

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:15.970 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no.

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
He says, we've made the decision
we're going to war with Iraq.

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:23.800 align:middle line:84%
This was on or about
the 20th of September.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, we're going
to war with Iraq?

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.120 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't know.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So I came back to see
him a few weeks later.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.667 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, we were
bombing in Afghanistan.

01:03:36.667 --> 01:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I said, are we still
going to war with Iraq?

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
it's worse than that.

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
He said-- he reached
over on his desk.

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
He picked up a piece of
paper, and he said, I just--

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.273 align:middle line:84%
he said, I just got
this down from upstairs,

01:03:46.273 --> 01:03:48.315 align:middle line:84%
meaning the secretary of
defense's office, today.

01:03:48.315 --> 01:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this is
a memo that describes

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
how we're going to take out
seven countries in five years.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Number one, Bush,
Republican, Blair, Labour,

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
picked Iraq off the list,
because that's what they were

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.070 align:middle line:90%
told to do.

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And Iraq, of course, was
invaded through weapons

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
of mass destruction
that didn't exist,

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.850 align:middle line:90%
because it was on the list.

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:17.330 align:middle line:90%
It had to be targeted.

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:18.610 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have an excuse.

01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:20.350 align:middle line:90%
They made one up.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Then there's this
transformation.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we go from Labour to
Cameron, David Cameron,

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
the British prime
minister, Conservative.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:34.930 align:middle line:10%
And we go from Republican
Bush to Democrat Obama.

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:36.770 align:middle line:90%
But what do they do?

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
They tic Libya off the
list, again based on a lie.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And they start the process to
create the Civil War in Syria.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Now drain the
swamp man comes in,

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and he's targeting Syria and
more and more targeting Iran.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:01.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Iran's leaders sow chaos,
death, and destruction.

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:05.830 align:middle line:10%
They do not respect their
neighbors or borders

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:09.130 align:middle line:10%
or the sovereign
rights of nations.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:14.950 align:middle line:10%
Instead, Iran's leaders
plunder the nation's resources

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:20.200 align:middle line:10%
to enrich themselves and to
spread mayhem across the Middle

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.770 align:middle line:10%
East and far beyond.

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The hidden hand
is calling the shots.

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.600 align:middle line:90%
They come and they go.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Where they want it to
lead, if we let them,

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.340 align:middle line:84%
as I've been saying in
Brighton since the 1990s,

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.450 align:middle line:90%
is World War III.

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
They always planned
three world wars.

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:42.890 align:middle line:10%
And what they want to do is play
off NATO against Russia, China,

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:45.610 align:middle line:10%
and allies like Iran.

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:49.630 align:middle line:10%
And that's what this is
all about, this insane

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:56.020 align:middle line:10%
demonization of Russia that
goes on day after day after day.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
They're seeking to soften
up global public opinion,

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Western public opinion,
to accept a war.

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
This is why you're
having this massive NATO

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
buildup of arms and troops
on the borders of countries

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that border Russia.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Next, leaders from NATO
countries met in Poland today

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to finalize plans to beef
up the military alliance.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
since the Cold War,

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
multi-national troops
will continuously

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
rotate through four
countries in Eastern Europe.

01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Russia has called this
buildup a provocation.

01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Is this a provocation?

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I would view
it as a deterrent.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.520 align:middle line:10%
And if I was looking
at it through the lens

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.530 align:middle line:10%
of a potential
aggressor, I would

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:41.535 align:middle line:10%
say it's an exceptionally
capable deterrent.

01:06:41.535 --> 01:06:43.160 align:middle line:10%
>> You've got all these troops--

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.870 align:middle line:10%
American troops,
British troops--

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:47.400 align:middle line:10%
that think they're
fighting for their country

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.770 align:middle line:10%
when what they're doing is
fighting for that force which

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.570 align:middle line:10%
is destroying their country and
is aimed to create a nightmare

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:57.940 align:middle line:10%
world for their kids
and their grandkids.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
If you keep invading
countries like Iraq,

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
then people will look
up from the game show

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.530 align:middle line:90%
and go, Ethel, Ethel.

01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:07.780 align:middle line:90%
They're invading someone else.

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you get the
population, or some of it,

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
in the target country to unseat
the leader you want to remove.

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
specialization of a group

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
of organizations called the
Open Society Foundation.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
It's run by this billionaire
Democon, George Soros.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.090 align:middle line:10%
They were behind
the manipulation

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:38.080 align:middle line:10%
of the Arab Spring.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
That went well for
Arabs, didn't it, that?

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And they are behind what are
called color revolutions,

01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
like the Rose
Revolution in Georgia

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and the Orange Revolution
in Ukraine, where they get

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.150 align:middle line:84%
the people to appear to have a
revolution against the leader,

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
but actually, that's not
what's really going on.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, a few weeks ago
now, George Soros

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
announced that he was going
to transfer $18 billion

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
to his Open Society
Foundation group,

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:13.750 align:middle line:84%
bringing his total donations
so far to $32 billion.

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of money
that is there to be

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.300 align:middle line:90%
used to disrupt countries.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the Soros
Open Society coups

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
was in Ukraine when they
replaced President Yanukovych,

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:31.319 align:middle line:84%
that was looking to Russia,
with this guy Poroshenko, who

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.760 align:middle line:90%
is a puppet of America.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.359 align:middle line:10%
And the person who oversaw
that was Victoria Nuland,

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:40.149 align:middle line:10%
Assistant Secretary of
State for Eurasian Affairs,

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:43.149 align:middle line:10%
who is the wife
of the co-founder

01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:45.850 align:middle line:10%
of the Project for the New
American Century, Robert Kagan.

01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
When you get deep
in the rabbit hole,

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
it's a very, very,
very small world.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And the trigger for all this,
this sequence that we're still

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:57.370 align:middle line:90%
seeing unfold, was 9/11.

01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:00.569 align:middle line:10%
And in that document
in September, 2000,

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:04.090 align:middle line:10%
it said that unless there
was a new Pearl Harbor,

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:06.130 align:middle line:10%
then this process
of regime change

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:07.960 align:middle line:10%
would necessarily be slow.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.359 align:middle line:10%
In the words of the document,
further, "the process

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:13.330 align:middle line:10%
of transformation is likely
to be a long one absent

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:18.210 align:middle line:10%
some catastrophic and catalyzing
event like a new Pearl Harbor."

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:21.790 align:middle line:10%
And one year to the month
after this was published,

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.200 align:middle line:10%
nine months after
the people that

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.569 align:middle line:10%
wrote it came to power
with Bush, America

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:28.000 align:middle line:10%
had what Bush called
at the time the Pearl

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Harbor of the 21st
century, which started

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.840 align:middle line:10%
the whole sequence running.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Know the outcome, and
you'll see the journey.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.960 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's important to
uncover where they want to go,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.819 align:middle line:90%
what their outcome is.

01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
know their outcome,

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
seeing the steps every
day towards that outcome

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.880 align:middle line:90%
are a doddle.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
know the outcome,

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:53.080 align:middle line:90%
then these steps are now random.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be no connection,
but the outcome connects them.

01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And this structure,
this pyramid,

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:02.200 align:middle line:90%
is where it's all been leading.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.320 align:middle line:10%
I call it the "Hunger
Games" society.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They want an elite 1% at
its core, less than 1%,

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.448 align:middle line:90%
that dictate everything.

01:10:11.448 --> 01:10:12.490 align:middle line:90%
They have all the wealth.

01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:13.720 align:middle line:90%
They have all the power.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
They have control
of the military.

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:18.850 align:middle line:84%
They have control of
government, the whole shebang.

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:20.830 align:middle line:10%
At the bottom,
they want the rest

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:23.860 align:middle line:10%
of humanity, basically, even
those who, at the moment,

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.290 align:middle line:10%
think they're doing OK.

01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:26.823 align:middle line:84%
They've got some
money in the bank.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
They've got a nice
house and that stuff.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.770 align:middle line:90%
None of this matters to me.

01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:32.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're not in the 1%,
they want that as well.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:38.260 align:middle line:10%
And in between, they want this,
quite demonstrably unfolding

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.810 align:middle line:10%
around the world,
police state-- actually,

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:43.720 align:middle line:10%
in the end
police-military state--

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.860 align:middle line:10%
to hold this status quo
and to impose the will

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.950 align:middle line:10%
of the 1% on the population.

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The outcome is they want a
world government, a world army,

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
a world central bank
dictating all finance

01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:59.620 align:middle line:90%
and a world electronic currency.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:05.080 align:middle line:84%
This is why they are running
around like headless chickens

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.820 align:middle line:90%
trying to stop Brexit now.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
They never believed that
anyone would vote to come out.

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Now they're trying to stop
it because the idea is

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
more and more countries
are sucked into the EU,

01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:16.810 align:middle line:90%
not that anyone leaves.

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they want a
police and military state where

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
they both fuse that we're
seeing the police look

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and act more and more like
the military all the time.

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
This is why a Pentagon
program called

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.480 align:middle line:84%
1033 is giving tanks to local
police forces in America.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Someone has to explain why
your local police department

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.863 align:middle line:10%
has gone from this to this.

01:11:41.863 --> 01:11:45.300 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Warren County, New York,
population 65,000 and home

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
to Lake George, is a
wintertime postcard--

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, picturesque,
and well protected.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
This September, the
sheriff's department

01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
took delivery of a fully
armored, mine-resistant vehicle

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.580 align:middle line:84%
called an MRAP, the same piece
of equipment used by soldiers

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.530 align:middle line:90%
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I would be remiss in doing
my job if I didn't prepare

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%
for the worst.

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:14.868 align:middle line:84%
>> But York is the
Warren County Sheriff.

01:12:14.868 --> 01:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm tasked with protecting
the public and protecting

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.270 align:middle line:90%
my people.

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
That accomplishes
both of those goals.

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you start dressing
and equipping people like

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
an occupying army, they
start acting like one.

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Every day there's another
story in the paper about cops

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
beating innocent people.

01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The video that's been
making the rounds out

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
here lately is a patrolman
punching the lights out

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
of a deranged
homeless grandmother.

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Even worse-- that's
their training video.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So the web controls politics,
money, commerce, media,

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
military, science,
medicine, and religion,

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and thus controls
perception and outcomes.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:57.122 align:middle line:84%
When we free our perceptions,
we free our lives.

01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And if enough of us
do it, then the world

01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:03.480 align:middle line:84%
becomes free into a world that,
instead of being a prison,

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
can become the paradise that
it once was and can be again.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Only because we
change, the world

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:16.138 align:middle line:84%
must change, because we are
the world, and the world is us.

01:13:16.138 --> 01:13:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much for coming.

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:24.065 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:24.065 --> 01:13:25.240 align:middle line:90%
That's very kind.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:33.910 align:middle line:90%


01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Honestly, this is for
James Holdworth, so James.

01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no problem.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks to you.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It was lovely to meet you.

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:45.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Lovely to meet you both.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:47.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Bye.

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Cheers, mate.

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.660 align:middle line:90%
All the best.

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:52.820 align:middle line:90%
That way.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:57.220 align:middle line:90%


01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you enjoy that?

01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic, man.

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Great, great people.

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
The people who come to my
events are absolutely fantastic

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.040 align:middle line:90%
people.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
They've got their
hearts centered.

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] how
we arrange the tour.

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Someone is always contacting.

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:13.265 align:middle line:84%
When are you coming
to Newcastle?

01:14:13.265 --> 01:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
When are you coming
to the Northeast?

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Always.

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>> This one, is it?

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, mate.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers, mate.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.114 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed that so much.

01:14:24.114 --> 01:14:29.532 align:middle line:84%
It makes it all
worthwhile when you--

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:34.000 align:middle line:90%
you see people like that who--

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.613 align:middle line:90%
you know, their minds are open.

01:14:35.613 --> 01:14:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Their hearts are open.

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:38.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just brilliant.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.407 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cross-section
of the population.

01:14:41.407 --> 01:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was a lot
of people there tonight,

01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I would take it, that
never heard it before,

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.700 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what
you want, really.

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll be sad when this
little tour is over, really.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm enjoying it
really enormously.

01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:04.262 align:middle line:84%
If we were going
to be stopped, it

01:15:04.262 --> 01:15:06.720 align:middle line:84%
was going to be in the old days
when no one wanted to know.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.637 align:middle line:90%
It's not gonna be now.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:09.308 align:middle line:90%


01:15:09.308 --> 01:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They're on the wrong
side of history.

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:25.650 align:middle line:90%


01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:30.750 align:middle line:10%
Where we're sitting now in
this relatively small part

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:35.850 align:middle line:10%
of America is the
epicenter through which

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:40.290 align:middle line:10%
the end of humanity as we
know it is being orchestrated.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Up to this point, human
perception has been controlled

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
by controlling as much as
they possibly could through

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:52.620 align:middle line:90%
religion, through media control.

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
By controlling the information
that people receive from which

01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
they form perceptions,
humanity has

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
been manipulated
to become clever

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.980 align:middle line:90%
in the sense of intellect--

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
clever enough to build its
own technological prison,

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:18.300 align:middle line:84%
but not wise enough to see
that that's what it's doing.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.485 align:middle line:84%
What we call today fantastic
technological progress--

01:16:22.485 --> 01:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying there's not
some good things about it.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But what it is in its
totality, and its base form,

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:31.350 align:middle line:90%
is a prison for the human mind.

01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:35.190 align:middle line:90%
People never ask this question.

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:38.310 align:middle line:90%
What is AI?

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:41.310 align:middle line:10%
This AI mind control,
the assimilation,

01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:43.710 align:middle line:10%
is unfolding before
our eyes if we only

01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:48.390 align:middle line:10%
see the outcome and therefore
the steps towards it.

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have people attached

01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
to technology, their brains
attached to technology and AI.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.460 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
them addicted to it.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Stage one-- get them
addicted to holdables,

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.080 align:middle line:84%
technology they hold, and start
them as young as possible.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> 50% of teens report that
they feel addicted to their cell

01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:08.392 align:middle line:90%
phones.

01:17:08.392 --> 01:17:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nothing to
do without a phone.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got an iPad so I
can watch TV or something.

01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:14.375 align:middle line:84%
But I can't read for,
like, five hours straight.

01:17:14.375 --> 01:17:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Reading is boring.

01:17:16.335 --> 01:17:17.972 align:middle line:90%
I don't want reading.

01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:20.430 align:middle line:10%
>> This is the first study that
shows a direct link between

01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:22.260 align:middle line:10%
screen time and mental health.

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.560 align:middle line:10%
The researchers note that
rates of anxiety and depression

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.800 align:middle line:10%
in young people have
actually risen over 70%.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> They call it digital
heroin because it becomes

01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
an addiction, because
the electronic stimulus

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and the digital stimulus becomes
an addiction to the brain just

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:38.900 align:middle line:90%
like a drug does.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.525 align:middle line:84%
That's why they put
them down, and they

01:17:40.525 --> 01:17:41.860 align:middle line:90%
have to pick them up again.

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.010 align:middle line:10%
>> The frenzy does
not seem to die down,

01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:47.460 align:middle line:10%
but that's what Apple is hoping
with higher-than-ever stakes

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.840 align:middle line:10%
for your smartphone dollar.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.700 align:middle line:10%
Here's ABC's Linzie Janis.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:54.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Out-of-control lines, people
waiting hours, even days.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.540 align:middle line:10%
Apple fans across
America don't appear

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.230 align:middle line:10%
to be losing any enthusiasm
over the iPhone, things

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:03.450 align:middle line:10%
in LA even turning violent.

01:18:03.450 --> 01:18:05.220 align:middle line:10%
Check out this
brawl that broke out

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:08.850 align:middle line:10%
after one man discovered someone
had been paying homeless people

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.890 align:middle line:10%
to hold places in line.

01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> After the
holdables, wearables,

01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:14.110 align:middle line:90%
you want to get in the body.

01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So now the next stage
is to get on the body.

01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
This is your Google Glass
and your Apple Watch

01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:20.730 align:middle line:90%
and your Bluetooth.

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, implantables
get inside the body.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:29.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The latest office innovation
is a microchip implanted

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.520 align:middle line:10%
in the skin.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the first American
company to ever try this.

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are they tracking,
and would you say yes

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:37.800 align:middle line:84%
if your boss asked
you to do the same?

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Turns out one of the biggest
discoveries is actually this

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.220 align:middle line:90%
tiny.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
You see how small that is?

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
This little chip may
be the next big thing.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like it's
right from a sci-fi movie,

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
but people all over the
world are implanting these

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.360 align:middle line:90%
into their wrists.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you know the outcome,
you can see the journey.

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the
ultimate end game, which

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:05.820 align:middle line:84%
is to attach the human mind, the
human brain to AI so that AI--

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
becomes the human mind,

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and the human mind as
we know it is no more,

01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
you can see the progression
there of the stepping stones.

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we are at
the cusp of a massive choice

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:23.520 align:middle line:90%
that humanity has.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go on down this
road for not much longer--

01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and some of these major
players in Silicon Valley,

01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
like Google's Ray
Kurzweil, they're

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:35.370 align:middle line:84%
talking about this AI
brain connection happening

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.210 align:middle line:90%
around 2030 onwards.

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And let me
summarize it for you.

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, today, you have a
computer in your phone.

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you need 10,000
computers for a few seconds

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to do a complex search, you can
access that for a second or two

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:50.330 align:middle line:90%
in the cloud.

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
In the 2030s, you need
some extra neocortex,

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to connect
to that in the cloud

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.215 align:middle line:90%
directly from your brain.

01:19:57.215 --> 01:19:58.590 align:middle line:10%
And so over the
next few decades,

01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:00.840 align:middle line:10%
we're going to do it again.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.450 align:middle line:84%
We're going to again expand
our neocortex, only this time,

01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:09.250 align:middle line:84%
it won't be limited by a fixed
architecture of enclosure.

01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It'll be expanded without limit.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
That additional
quantity will again

01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:17.370 align:middle line:84%
be the enabling factor for
another qualitative leap

01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:19.000 align:middle line:90%
in culture and technology.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.263 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:20:20.263 --> 01:20:23.510 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The sales pitch of connecting
the human brain to technology

01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:28.940 align:middle line:90%
is it will make us superhuman.

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.780 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But actually, even though
they're that close to it,

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
they still haven't seen it.

01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:38.970 align:middle line:84%
They're still looking at dots
and not seeing the picture.

01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:41.810 align:middle line:90%
This is where it's all going.

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And we are sitting now
in the epicenter of it,

01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
in front of a nondescript
building that seems

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.510 align:middle line:90%
to just be a search engine.

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Google.

01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:55.170 align:middle line:90%
It's Google this, Google that.

01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:59.550 align:middle line:10%
But actually, we're sitting at
the epicenter of human control.

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What does the Pentagon and
the intelligence agency complex

01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:03.360 align:middle line:90%
want?

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.980 align:middle line:10%
It wants control of
every bit of data,

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.080 align:middle line:10%
control from the population.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.410 align:middle line:10%
Silicon Valley gives it them.

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:17.400 align:middle line:10%
It wants to dictate what
people see and don't see.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.370 align:middle line:10%
Silicon Valley increasingly
gives it to them.

01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And it wants an
AI-controlled human race.

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And through Silicon Valley
and its corporations,

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.470 align:middle line:90%
that is what is being developed.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:34.080 align:middle line:10%
Pentagon Inc-- these
are masquerading

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.130 align:middle line:10%
as private companies.

01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:36.720 align:middle line:10%
They are Pentagon fronts.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.310 align:middle line:10%
That's why they do what they do.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, these organizations
like DARPA and the CIA,

01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
they have their
technological arms

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
which seed fund corporations
and technology that

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:53.610 align:middle line:84%
have a means of
serving their agenda.

01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA organization
is called In-Q-Tel, or IQT,

01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
which has seed funded
these organizations.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
You know Siri, this Apple office
assistant, and this office

01:22:04.930 --> 01:22:05.805 align:middle line:90%
assistant technology?

01:22:05.805 --> 01:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And people have them
all in their homes now.

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
God knows why.

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It was seed funded by DARPA,
the same organization that

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:17.520 align:middle line:84%
creates genetic extinction
technologies and death rays.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:21.660 align:middle line:90%


01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes a renegade mind that
looks at it in a different way,

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:32.054 align:middle line:84%
and especially an outside
mind who's not in it,

01:22:32.054 --> 01:22:35.610 align:middle line:90%
to see the blatantly obvious.

01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:44.350 align:middle line:84%
If we don't see the picture,
then the future for humanity

01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:46.720 align:middle line:90%
is very unpleasant indeed.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
If we do see the
picture and head it off,

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.782 align:middle line:84%
then we can start to build
a world worth living in.

01:22:53.782 --> 01:22:57.718 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:22:57.718 --> 01:23:02.650 align:middle line:90%


01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
People have reminded me over
the years of that famous quote

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
by Gandhi, which said
first they ignore you,

01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
then they laugh at you, then
they fight you, then you win.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I went through the
period of ridicule.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I went through the
period of being ignored.

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I went through the period of
being laughed at in the street.

01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And now it's completely changed.

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being laughed at in
the street around the world,

01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm stopped in the
street to talk seriously

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.200 align:middle line:90%
about the information.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Instead of wondering where the
next audience is coming from--

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
as I used to say,
I could have spoken

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.066 align:middle line:84%
in a phone box for many years,
and there'd still be room.

01:23:54.066 --> 01:23:56.316 align:middle line:90%
And the interest is fantastic.

01:23:56.316 --> 01:23:59.788 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:59.788 --> 01:24:10.210 align:middle line:90%


01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> People are just waking
up, which is amazing.

01:24:12.570 --> 01:24:15.863 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's becoming
more obvious now.

01:24:15.863 --> 01:24:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I think as the
agenda is obviously

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.390 align:middle line:84%
going nearer and nearer
and nearer to the end goal,

01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:20.650 align:middle line:84%
it's just opened
itself up, and it's

01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:21.942 align:middle line:90%
becoming more and more obvious.

01:24:21.942 --> 01:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's
encouraging, massively.

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> People aren't
buying it anymore.

01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
They're not buying the official
explanation of everything.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And more and more people are
mistrusting of their mainstream

01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:36.190 align:middle line:84%
media sources and
their politicians,

01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and so on, because they've been
given so many examples over

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the years that they
can't be trusted.

01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel the genie
is out of the bottle,

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.570 align:middle line:90%
and it's not going back.

01:24:46.570 --> 01:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We had a tax
imposed in the 1980s

01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:55.210 align:middle line:84%
by Margaret Thatcher
called the poll tax.

01:24:55.210 --> 01:25:00.400 align:middle line:10%
It was a desperately unjust tax.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:08.980 align:middle line:10%
And large numbers of people
simply refused to pay the tax.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.360 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.410 align:middle line:84%
They had to change
the tax and drop it.

01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Not only that.

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It was the start of the
end for Margaret Thatcher,

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
who was perceived as the Iron
Lady and who was impregnable.

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And all people have done
is say no, not doing it.

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Someone comes out
of Downing Street.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Someone comes out
of the White House.

01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
They say, we've had
a meeting, and this

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.530 align:middle line:90%
is what's going to happen.

01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
What if enough people
say, we're not doing it?

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:44.620 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing it.

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Where is their power?

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.410 align:middle line:90%
There is none.

01:25:47.410 --> 01:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
The power of the few is in
the acquiescence of the many.

01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we stop acquiescing
with our own enslavement,

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.030 align:middle line:90%
we cannot be enslaved.

01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:03.500 align:middle line:90%
We are at a fork in the road.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
If we go on as we
are, we will live

01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
in a fascistic, Orwellian
global state within decades.

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm being seriously
optimistic when I say decades.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.200 align:middle line:84%
If we take our power back,
and we start questioning,

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and we stop fighting
among ourselves,

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:29.380 align:middle line:84%
then 7.5 billion people can't
be controlled by a handful

01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:32.650 align:middle line:84%
if the 7.5 billion, A,
know what's going on,

01:26:32.650 --> 01:26:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and B, won't have it.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:42.250 align:middle line:90%


01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:43.990 align:middle line:84%
My whole life has
been synchronistic

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:47.080 align:middle line:84%
when I look back, amazing
coincidences leading me

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.460 align:middle line:90%
in certain directions.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But since I had my
mind explosion in 1991,

01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
the synchronicity have
been unbelievable.

01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:57.940 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We're filming about
my life, which

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.930 align:middle line:84%
is about defending
and expanding freedom.

01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:07.750 align:middle line:84%
We've come onto the pier
where I stood as a kid,

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:10.030 align:middle line:90%
watching steam trains go past.

01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's some kids
here on the beach.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And look what they're
writing in the sand.

01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom!

01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:21.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom!

01:27:21.668 --> 01:27:23.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom!

01:27:23.096 --> 01:27:25.420 align:middle line:90%


01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I get--

01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:30.630 align:middle line:90%


01:27:30.630 --> 01:27:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I get emotional with
it because of what's

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.918 align:middle line:84%
happening in the world compared
to what could be happening--

01:27:42.918 --> 01:27:45.210 align:middle line:84%
the enslavement that could
be freedom, the illness that

01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:46.010 align:middle line:90%
could be health.

01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:49.340 align:middle line:90%


01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what drives me on--

01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:54.510 align:middle line:90%
knowing what it could be.

01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I can see it traveling
around the world

01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and seeing people awakening,
seeing through the bullshit,

01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:06.150 align:middle line:84%
seeing through the hoax, seeing
through the manipulation, which

01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:08.210 align:middle line:84%
is what is holding
us in servitude.

01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of people
that are seeing it--

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
former system people who you'd
never think would see it.

01:28:13.890 --> 01:28:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Young people are seeing it.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.690 align:middle line:84%
People in their latter
years are seeing it.

01:28:18.690 --> 01:28:20.610 align:middle line:90%
There is something happening.

01:28:20.610 --> 01:28:23.740 align:middle line:90%
There's something happening.

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
This is-- just something
simple like this

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.890 align:middle line:84%
is just so frickin' symbolic
of where we are going.

01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:35.824 align:middle line:84%
And we must not stop
until it happens.

01:28:35.824 --> 01:28:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what kind of
world are those kids

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:42.690 align:middle line:84%
going to live in if
we go on as we are?

01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to,
much as that will distress

01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:52.666 align:middle line:90%
those that wish it to happen.

01:28:52.666 --> 01:28:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an end
game, and it's here.

01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:00.210 align:middle line:90%
That drives me on.

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:03.360 align:middle line:10%
That gets me up in
the morning every day

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.190 align:middle line:10%
to go on pounding this out.

01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:10.800 align:middle line:10%
It's what gets me on
planes all the time

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.840 align:middle line:10%
going around the world talking.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
history of the world,

01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
it's renegades, by
that definition,

01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that are the only people that
have ever changed anything.

01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther King
was a renegade.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Gandhi was a renegade.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again, across
all the institutions,

01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:38.040 align:middle line:84%
you've had medical renegades
and scientific renegades,

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.320 align:middle line:90%
political renegades.

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're always the
ones that change anything.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
challenging the status quo.

01:29:48.730 --> 01:29:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way we're
going to change anything.

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:54.570 align:middle line:90%

it stands there.

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.360 align:middle line:10%
as many as they want?

You can only do it
for personal use.

outside of the official

You get endless abuse.

That's your freedom.

But if you think that
you can have an opinion

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and I can't, well, see that,
because I don't give a shit.

01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:48.610 align:middle line:90%
You have a right to freedom.

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:50.920 align:middle line:90%

Oh, yeah, I have freedom.

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.160 align:middle line:90%

Well, I have that right too,
and so does everyone else.
