This is how you do it.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.730 align:middle line:84%

say, oh, 30 years ago,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%

And we just connected.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.177 align:middle line:84%
There was just a place in

00:05:24.177 --> 00:05:26.635 align:middle line:84%
Every day at Cafe Gratitude,
we have a question of the day.

00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:28.301 align:middle line:84%
And the question of
the day was, what do

00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:90%
you want to do before you die.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And Frank said, I want to
fall in love one more time.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think anyone
will love me with this body

that I'm wearing.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't love myself.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:90%
This propelled me into action.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I just was like, you
want to do something?

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:90%
You want to do an experiment?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.975 align:middle line:84%
How about you come in here,
and you eat this food,

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and you allow us to be your

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and get up under you and support
you in loving yourself, loving

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.575 align:middle line:84%
your life, loving your body so
that someone else can love you.

00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And we'll document the thing.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:10%
>>I think it might have been
the next day, Frank came back.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:10%
And he was like, let's do this.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
At this point, we
didn't have a camera.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any-- I didn't
have any filmmaking experience.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, we didn't really
know what we were doing.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:90%
So we just really jumped in.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:90%
We went for it.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Frank's one of those guys
that, when he walks in,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.221 align:middle line:84%
he's not someone who's
quiet until you meet them.

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:10%
He walks in and, before he
knows anyone in the room,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:10%
he's already commenting about
the space or making a joke.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:90%
So immediately, I liked him.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.136 align:middle line:84%
Because I like people
that are just funny

00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and say what
everyone's thinking.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:90%
And Frank definitely does that.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, there
was the comedy

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that was going to happen
out of New Yorker taking

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
on eating vegan raw
food for 40 days

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
was going to be pretty
funny, especially

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
someone who was going to
say what they were thinking

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.151 align:middle line:90%
while they were eating it.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping this project
with Frank will give him

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.852 align:middle line:90%
a different perspective.

00:07:02.852 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
He's definitely
going to transform.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we can heal
the self-diminishing aspect

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.616 align:middle line:84%
of Frank, that's going to change
a lot of aspects of his life.

00:07:14.616 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.635 align:middle line:84%
>>In 2002 I was diagnosed with
hepatitis C. Prior to that,

00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I had gone through
a battery of tests

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.340 align:middle line:84%
to try to establish why I
was so fatigued all the time.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't find
the hepatitis C.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they were treating me
for narcolepsy, for God's sake.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And it all made sense
all of a sudden.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I had no opportunity
or window for denial

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this
wasn't happening.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the fatigue
was with me constantly.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So a doctor put me on
Ribavirin and interferon, which

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I was told was sort of a form
of chemotherapy similar to what

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:90%
women with breast cancer get.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm taking
Ribavirin every day

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and an injection of
interferon every week.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
However, to counter the
side effects of these drugs,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking a slew of other
medications, anti-depressants--

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:84%
because one of the side
effects is depression.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:10%
Another side effect is fatigue.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:10%
Another side effect
is achy joints.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Another side effect
is irritability.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Another side effect
is poor sleep.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like on, and
on, and on, and on, and on.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
In the morning I practically
take a fistful of pills

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.873 align:middle line:84%
that, I don't really even
know what they're doing.

00:08:33.873 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
They just tell me to take
them and I take them.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.992 align:middle line:84%
And I feel really terrible
about it, quite frankly.

00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm sad
because something's happening

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm sad because
of the medications.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just awful.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just a really, really
difficult place to be.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I come
back to the place

00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
where I'm here and in this
situation because of the way

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I played my cards, the
decisions that I made when

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I was out there using,
and ripping, and running,

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:90%
and carrying on.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And on top of it, I'm
lucky that it's not worse.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Because it could be worse.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:90%
It could be HIV.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be a series
of other things.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm lucky, because I have an 80%
chance of getting through this.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not feeling to luck.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not feeling the gratitude.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I keep thinking,
everyday, well, something

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:84%
will happen today that
will create a shift.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And I keep thinking,
a shift is coming.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.389 align:middle line:84%
I know that I--
somewhere in me, I

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:38.055 align:middle line:84%
believe that things
are going to change.

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.501 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I don't
see how or I don't

00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:90%
know how it's going to happen.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
way down there

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that gets me to get out of
bed and put one foot in front

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:90%
of the other and carry on.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And some days are
harder than others.

00:10:08.386 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
The type of neighborhood it
was at the time was early '50s.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a $100
a month 5-room flat.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Poor, I guess.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.912 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:23.834 align:middle line:10%
I guess it's difficult saying
that for whatever reason.

00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, we were poor.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>I had four children
in that apartment.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Whatever was difficult, it
was not to have a child.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what I want.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:10%
So when Frankie was
born I was in Heaven.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>I admired-- you
know, Frank was God.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:90%
He was my older brother.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.374 align:middle line:84%
He was a role model,
I guess you'd say.

00:10:46.374 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But he just didn't
like me very much.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:90%
I guess I was a pain in the ass.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:10%
>>As a kid, Frank was--
he loved to laugh.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And Frank had a
really big laugh.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And Angelo make him
laugh all the time.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And if they weren't laughing
together, they were fighting.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Frankie busted me
up a couple times.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
One time I got him pissed
off for some fucking reason

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.693 align:middle line:90%
and he threw a toy horn at me.

00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:90%
And it punctured my head.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And fucking blood
came flying out.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.809 align:middle line:90%
My mother was screaming.

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Another time he was trying
to keep me out of the house.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And we had this big door with
a big piece of glass in it.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.657 align:middle line:90%
And he pushed the glass in.

00:11:26.657 --> 00:11:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And that fucking glass
showered all over me.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:90%
It cut me up pretty bad.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.247 align:middle line:90%
Frank was a prick.

00:11:32.247 --> 00:11:33.455 align:middle line:90%
He just had to be in control.

00:11:33.455 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was the--
well, he was the firstborn.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.125 align:middle line:90%
You're the king of the mountain.

00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
there's somebody else there.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>My relationship
with Frank changed

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
when he started to
really get into drugs.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>It was lightweight at first.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Frankie, being
older and whatever,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
started messing with
powders, specifically speed.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
At first, it was
this whole thing.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.992 align:middle line:90%
Needles were totally taboo.

00:12:10.992 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I remember my
mother finding a set

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:84%
of what we used to call
gimmicks in a Marlboro box.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.705 align:middle line:84%
It was a homemade syringe
and blah, blah, blah.

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I remember her smashing it,
throwing it in the incinerator.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>He did marijuana, hash.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
We all experimented-- I
experimented as well--

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:90%
with drugs.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until he
started doing heroin

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
that our relationship
really deteriorated.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>I was 14.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I was 14 years old and
I was a fucking junkie.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Frankie was 15 and 1/2.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:90%
He was a fucking junkie.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:90%
I remember it was like a ritual.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Either one or the other
of us would come home

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:90%
with a little bit of smack.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
That became a ritual.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:84%
That became something that we
both really, really enjoyed

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and looked forward
and were disappointed

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.754 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't keep it going.

00:13:11.754 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, some of the best
times I had with Frankie,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, was
around chasing junk.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, it wound
up the way it did

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:90%
because we had no good guides.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.315 align:middle line:90%
We had no fucking good guides.

00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:37.432 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.432 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>So I'll read this.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I agree to eat three meals
at Cafe Gratitude which

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
are approved by either
Mathew or Tersus.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Two, I agree to complete my
daily log book every day,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.467 align:middle line:90%
all portions, at breakfast.

00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I agree to do my daily
affirmation every day

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
when I wake up and
every night before bed.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I agree to walk 15
minutes every day.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.362 align:middle line:84%
I agree to order my food
in its affirmation name.

00:14:02.362 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I agree to drink a
gallon of water a day.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I agree to call either
Cary, Conor, or Ryland

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.045 align:middle line:84%
and communicate whether I have
completed my daily agreement

00:14:09.045 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I agree to be on time
for all my appointments.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I agree, gratefully and
happily, to be on time

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:90%
for all my divine appointments.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:90%
I agree to not degrade myself.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:90%
I agree not to degrade myself.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I agree to relate to
my food as medicine

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:90%
and my medicine as my food.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yes.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I agree to be coachable
and be in this project

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:90%
with a beginner's mind.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely have my word.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I understand and agree to relate
to Conor, Cary, and Ryland

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
as coaches and my coaches in
the transformation of my life.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
What does that-- I mean, I'm
not sure what that means.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.799 align:middle line:90%
I mean if that's--

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, it's kind of like you--

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.861 align:middle line:90%
>>Respect?

00:14:56.861 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, no, it's like a coach.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, to understand
that we are your coach.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.525 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you're an athlete and
the game that we're playing

00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:06.715 align:middle line:84%
is transformation of your life,
you are the player in that.

00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And we're your coach.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.053 align:middle line:84%
And just to know that
when we say things to you

00:15:12.053 --> 00:15:15.665 align:middle line:84%
and when we-- it's because
we are coaching you

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.815 align:middle line:90%
in getting this surrendering.

00:15:17.815 --> 00:15:19.095 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm already resisting.

00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:19.594 align:middle line:90%
>>I know.

00:15:19.594 --> 00:15:20.094 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:15:20.094 --> 00:15:21.093 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm already resisting.

00:15:21.093 --> 00:15:21.805 align:middle line:90%
But I agree.

00:15:21.805 --> 00:15:27.834 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.834 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Come on, Frank.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:90%
These have got to go.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
These are not-- maybe they're
raw, but they're frozen.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:90%
But they got no nutrition.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.732 align:middle line:90%
This, it has got to go.

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
That would fit right
there on your belly.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.695 align:middle line:90%
That's enough of that.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And looks like he's got fried
chicken-- a double no-no, fried

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and chicken.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.606 align:middle line:90%
Man.

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:90%
What else we got in here?

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:02.224 align:middle line:84%
Oh man, Hamburger
Helper and peas.

00:16:02.224 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh man.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.442 align:middle line:84%
A lot's going to
change in there.

00:16:06.442 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a boombox.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.288 align:middle line:90%
>>Bootleg Apple-O's.

00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:11.634 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha.

00:16:11.634 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>>Nice try, Frankie.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>I haven't eaten
any of that crap.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.334 align:middle line:84%
>>Don't worry, this isn't
going to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:17.334 --> 00:16:18.636 align:middle line:90%
>>I haven't eaten any of that.

00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, right.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Motherload.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Jackpot.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.765 align:middle line:90%
>>Rancher's Reserve.

00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>What is that?

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:90%
What's the cut?

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:90%
What's the cut?

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>T-bone.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Pot roast.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.015 align:middle line:90%
>>Chuck.

00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:31.168 align:middle line:90%
He can't even be with us.

00:16:31.168 --> 00:16:32.293 align:middle line:90%
He left the room right now.

00:16:32.293 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Motherload.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
We know what Frankie's
been sneaking.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.901 align:middle line:84%
>>Chicken nuggets that were
here the first day I met Frank.

00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Still there.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:90%
At least he didn't eat them.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, look at this.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Yum.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.339 align:middle line:90%
>>That was good.

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>That's actually
growing vegetables on it.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Ooh, cheese.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Parmesan.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Neighbors will have that.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.588 align:middle line:90%
>>Butter.

00:16:57.588 --> 00:16:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>>Butter, le beurre.

00:16:59.025 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:84%
A fresh one in the pot for the
neighbors. [INAUDIBLE] out.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>What about this?

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Syrup?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:90%
No, sir.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.547 align:middle line:90%
>>Sugar.

00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>What's that?

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Salt?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Salt.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, no.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Pasta.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:90%
>>That's not mine.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:90%
That was left here.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Liar.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.055 align:middle line:84%

>>What do I gotta give
away my microwave for?

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
I find interesting

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:10%
about the boys, Ryland,
Conor, and Cary,

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:10%
are three completely different
human beings operating

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.340 align:middle line:10%
within a similar paradigm.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
When we're together it
really feels like a family.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the same
place doing our thing

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%
it's very playful.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It really feels
like-- I sometimes

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
feel like a lion with,
like, mid-sized cubs.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Ryland is like a very
energetic yes guy.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:84%
He's sort of impetuous, but
in a really wonderful way.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
He's impetuous because
he's so positive.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that I'm
very careful about talking

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:90%
to about stuff.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.045 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll say something and
he'll say, OK, well, let's go

00:18:03.045 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%
do it.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:03.820 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes with Conor,
I get the impression

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that when he looks at
me, he really empathizes.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I get the feeling
that he really knows

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
what's going on inside
of me at that given time.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
They're all playful, but he's
playful in a different way.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.425 align:middle line:84%
He's got one foot in the
adult world and one foot

00:18:23.425 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:90%
in the teenage world.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And he plays music
and he does fun things

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and goes out with 40-year-old
women, which is pretty cool.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there's Cary,
who's really contemplative

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and, I guess for some,
could be hard to read.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he's hard to read.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
But he does play his cards
very close to his chest.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And he's very careful.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately
for him, I find

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:84%
it easy to read through
that because I understand it

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.607 align:middle line:84%
You need oregano,
and you need lettuce,

00:18:57.607 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and you need tomatoes
to make a salad.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And every ingredient is
integral to that salad.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And put them all together
and it's wonderful.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Individually,
they're all good too.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it's like.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.995 align:middle line:90%
They're like a salad.

00:19:11.995 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:90%
I can separate them.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, they're
from one bowl of lunacy.

started off of me

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%

saying, for his body

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.574 align:middle line:84%

does, you don't feel

00:19:49.574 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%

able to love yourself enough

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:84%

almost everything--

he was talking about

four or five shots of expresso.

point, four and five shots

I'm just using coffee like
an amphetamine, essentially,

to get past that next-- and what
I mentioned to him yesterday

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:84%
was, I noticed, at the workshop,
that when you and Tersus, you

Take it easy.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Now get outta here before
you think of something else.

And I'm also our

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a quick
look, here, at your blood.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call a live
blood analysis, in which we're

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:90%
using a darkfield microscope.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first things
that I'm seeing here

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:84%
is you've got some
bacterial forms that

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.990 align:middle line:90%
are in your protoplasm.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:39:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You probably have a serious
issue with yeast overgrowth.

Anybody who has cancer, any
other kind of major disease,

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:84%
long before you get
that-- 20, 30, 40

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:84%
years before that-- you start
having issues with yeast

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:90%
overgrowth.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Frank has all of the
issues of illness

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that are appropriate for
someone who eats that way.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Say if you have an almond
and you take that almond

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and you plant it
into the ground,

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.980 align:middle line:90%
it grows into an almond tree.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you take an
almond and you cook it

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you plant
it in the ground,

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.640 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't grow into anything.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason is because enzymes
have been killed in it.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it cannot then create
life as a result of that.

He's venturing out into
the unknown for him.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.570 align:middle line:90%

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.620 align:middle line:90%
And she called.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my god,
she actually called me back.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.640 align:middle line:84%

much I cared for her

was when I was alone
in the dark room.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.650 align:middle line:90%
I would be developing prints.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And watching her image
emerge in the tray

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.240 align:middle line:84%
was similar to the feeling
I was having internally.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Up until that time I had
never make the moves on her.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.080 align:middle line:84%

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.240 align:middle line:90%
her like a piece of China.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%

was more than enough.

I mean, even after
10 years of marriage,

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.420 align:middle line:84%
she could not get dressed

without me chasing
her around the house.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Even if she was mean, nasty,
or hateful-- like sometimes

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.910 align:middle line:90%
I would be sitting there.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And as she's yelling
at me about something,

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.340 align:middle line:84%

>>Yeah, he did.

01:08:15.678 --> 01:08:18.421 align:middle line:90%
That'd be like 264.

01:08:18.421 --> 01:08:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.189 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot, man.

01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:21.470 align:middle line:90%
What was it before?

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:22.689 align:middle line:90%
>>287.

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:23.569 align:middle line:90%

01:08:24.196 --> 01:08:25.529 align:middle line:90%
>>So what do you got now, Frank?

01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:26.029 align:middle line:90%
>>How many?

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:27.283 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute, man.

01:08:27.283 --> 01:08:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:28.676 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute, man.

01:08:28.676 --> 01:08:30.144 align:middle line:90%
That shit is wrong, man.

01:08:30.144 --> 01:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>The scale just
became his best friend.

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.577 align:middle line:90%
>>This scale is fucked up, man.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.399 align:middle line:90%
>>No, it's not lying.

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%
We used the same scale.

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:40.603 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so between 264 and 265.

01:08:40.603 --> 01:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>No kidding?

01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:43.743 align:middle line:90%
Holy Christ.

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, no wonder I saw
my foreskin this morning.

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.440 align:middle line:90%
A pound a day.

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:48.939 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:50.733 align:middle line:90%

>>"Dear Mia, I hope
this letter finds

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.240 align:middle line:90%
you well and in good spirits.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.529 align:middle line:84%
We have known each
other nearly 30 years

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:23.189 align:middle line:90%
and raised two children.

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Over the years,
I have, at times,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.939 align:middle line:84%
responded with anger
and resentment--

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I have responded to you
with anger and resentment.

01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:32.319 align:middle line:84%
I want to apologize
for all the times

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I was unreliable and
emotionally irresponsible due

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.600 align:middle line:90%
to my drinking.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.540 align:middle line:84%
The anger I held
onto over the years

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.100 align:middle line:84%
was more empowering than
to deal with how crushed I

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.120 align:middle line:90%
was when we divorced.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Even when we were in court,
I looked across the aisle

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and wondered how love
turns into litigation.

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I began to believe that
you never really loved me.

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:58.800 align:middle line:84%
That feeling was
too overwhelming.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Anger was a place
of false power.

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to consider the
possibility of a relationship

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
of trust and warmth,
a relationship where

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
we could both be with our own
children at the same time.

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I apologize for my
terrible behavior

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.450 align:middle line:84%
as I plunged headfirst
into the pit of addiction.

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I have been clean and
sober for 17 years.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Many of the characteristics
that I demonstrated

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.920 align:middle line:90%
were triggered by alcohol.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
That is not an excuse,
it's just an explanation.

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to consider
that I am a different person.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
You may-- you may have loved
me, but I did not love myself.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
As a result, I blamed you for my
inability to feel loved by you.

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I ask you to consider the
possibility that we need not

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.330 align:middle line:90%
have a broken family.

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
What we could have is a
mutually loving relationship

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
with our children and
release the broken record

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.860 align:middle line:90%
of hostilities.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I will always be
grateful for you

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
choosing me to be the dad of
our beautiful Nick and Lisa.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Let us be an example of love
and generosity and compassion.

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I invite you and
Lisa, my daughter,

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
to come to San Francisco
and be with who I am now.

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Since this is an invitation,
I will pay for the tickets.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the taking the
time to read this letter.

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I request that you respond
as soon as you comfortably

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.560 align:middle line:84%
can so that I can arrange
travel most convenient for you."

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.548 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, I'm so-- you
look good, Frank.

01:11:34.548 --> 01:11:35.544 align:middle line:90%
You look good.

01:11:35.544 --> 01:11:41.520 align:middle line:90%


01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.083 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm gonna go by and check
out the-- stop by the house.

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Because last night,
I stopped by.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was some smooth, sexy
records on, candles lit,

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.970 align:middle line:90%
a nice vanilla aroma in the air.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:00.245 align:middle line:84%
And people were
putting on clothes

01:12:00.245 --> 01:12:02.203 align:middle line:84%
when I busted through
the door with the camera.

01:12:02.203 --> 01:12:07.885 align:middle line:84%
So definitely,
that's a good sign.

01:12:07.885 --> 01:12:11.085 align:middle line:90%
Lovemaking is lovemaking.

01:12:11.085 --> 01:12:14.650 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] it's the boys.

01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:17.200 align:middle line:90%
What's been the experience?

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.425 align:middle line:84%
>>My experience is
that I'm still enraged.

01:12:19.425 --> 01:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I am still so caught up in
my anger towards my in-laws

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and my daughter and Mia.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Part of my rage is that I
feel like I can't do anything

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:36.810 align:middle line:90%
about it.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I can't do-- and I
fucking want to break

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.590 align:middle line:84%
my fucking
brother-in-law's face.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to smash my
sister-in-law's face.

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to fucking
hit all of them

01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
for letting this
whole thing happen,

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
to take away my ability
to take care of my kid,

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
to take-- to fucking
do that to me

01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and to not even question
once whether or not

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
what they were hearing or what
they were assuming was true.

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this gang
of people that maintain

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.170 align:middle line:90%
this thing with my daughter.

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Because my daughter could not
maintain this kind of feeling.

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Shut the fuck up.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interrupting you.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Wait a minute.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.069 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, listen--

01:13:19.069 --> 01:13:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>I want the story to be clear.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>You want the story to be what?

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Your way?

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Fuck you.

>>Until you see Lisa face to
face and deal with her anger--

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
she's angry because of what
she saw me going through.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Because see, you
didn't see that.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.680 align:middle line:90%
She saw it.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.600 align:middle line:90%
I am trying to help you.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way I can
help you is to try

01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:40.334 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what to do
with the family over there.

01:13:40.334 --> 01:13:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>You want to help me?

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Go tell Lisa that it was a
fucked up thing that everybody

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.259 align:middle line:90%
did.

01:13:44.259 --> 01:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe she'll start seeing--
maybe she starts getting--

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.249 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you think that--
don't you think

01:13:49.249 --> 01:13:50.540 align:middle line:90%
that I have said things to her?

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't I don't think
that-- don't believe that nobody

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:59.040 align:middle line:84%
has said anything that remotely
fucking resembles the truth

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.630 align:middle line:90%
to that kid, not even remotely.

01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:05.651 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody ever say to her
this was not right, what we did?

01:14:05.651 --> 01:14:06.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever said that.

01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Because they can't.

01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
They haven't got
the fucking balls.

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has the balls, in
that family, to say, hey,

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
this was a wrong thing.

01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's deal with it.

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:18.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>We were right.

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Frank, fucking right.

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:25.970 align:middle line:90%


01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:26.520 align:middle line:90%
I gotta go.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm so fucking-- I'm crazy.

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm just so angry right now.

>>You did what you
selfishly thought was right.

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
You just cared about
yourself, Frank.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.160 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do it for Nick.

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Because his whole fucking
thing affected Nick too.

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
What kind of psychological
shit did you put him through?

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:49.350 align:middle line:90%
You didn't think about him.

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:50.720 align:middle line:90%
You thought about Frank.

gone anywhere.

you need to bump up against.
