to some of the

of Chinese civilization.

But the ancient temples that
embraced the steep slopes

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:90%
harbored a single facet.

mountains of Wudang

of Taoism of traditional

in the Hubei province
in central China

The very humid
climate of the region

shrouds these suspended
valleys in a perpetual mist,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.265 align:middle line:84%
lending the region
an aura of mystery.

to the rocky slopes
of the mountain,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is a vast complex of medieval
temples and monasteries.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
These buildings form a
group of more than 60 sites

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
now inscribed by UNESCO on
the World Heritage list.

Apart from its exceptional
architectural merit,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.227 align:middle line:84%
it was from this unique
region that Taoism flourished.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The oldest buildings date
from the seventh century.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But most of them were
built in the 15th century

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
during the Ming Dynasty, when
the emperor Zhi Di undertook

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
a series of massive construction
projects, the most famous

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:84%
being the Forbidden
City in Peking.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
The emperor sent over 20,000
soldiers to the Wudang

mountains in order
to construct temples

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in honor of Xuanwu, an
important Taoist god.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
According to legend, Xuanwu
was born into a royal family,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
but renounced the
throne at the age of 15.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
He then retired here as a
hermit in order to seek truth.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
After four decades as an
ascetic, he flew to heaven

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and became immortal.

and poised over a sheer drop

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
had served as an incense burner.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Here, intrepid worshipers
would defy the precipice

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to display
their piety to the god.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Today after praying,
visitors simply

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:90%

The architectural diversity of
the sacred buildings of Wudang

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
is highly representative
of the art and architecture

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
of the successive
ruling dynasties.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.834 align:middle line:84%
It attests to the genius of a
thousand years of civilization.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of the temples and

Monastic tradition
remains alive here,

despite having
fallen into disuse

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:90%
during the mid 20th century.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:84%

the Cultural Revolution,
set in motion by Mao Zedong,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.095 align:middle line:84%

The recent emergence of

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:90%

For these new holiday
makers, Wudang

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is a popular destination,
both for the beauty

of the landscape, as well as
the inestimable religious sites

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
There are, for example, about
1,500 bronze, iron, wood,

or stone statues,
as well as hundreds

To fully discover
this extensive site,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
visitors need to stay
in Wudang several days.

As a result, gigantic
hotel complexes

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
have been built in the
vicinity of the park.

In order to preserve
its fragile environment,

private vehicles are
banned inside the park.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%

that the health of the body and
that of the mind are linked,

of an incorrect
circulation of energy,

To find inner peace,
the individual

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to attain the balance
between the opposing

forces of the yin and the yang,
the visible and the invisible,

the light and darkness.

Contrary to Kung Fu, a
so-called external martial art,

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
inherited from the Buddhist
monks of the Shaolin school,

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the Taoist monks
of Wudang developed

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
a style called internal that
considers interior strength

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:90%
superior to muscular strength.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Tai Chi stems from
this approach.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:84%
The Wudang style is attributed
to a wandering monk who retired

here with his disciples.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
According to legend,
he had a revelation

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.850 align:middle line:84%
while watching a crane
and a snake fighting.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.380 align:middle line:84%
The reptile's suppleness
and continuous movement

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:84%
allowed it to escape the
bird's frenzied attack.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:84%
From this, the monk formulated
the founding principles

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:84%
of the internal
arts, the primacy

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.245 align:middle line:84%
of suppleness over rigidity, of
the intellect over brute force.

called Qigong, literally
the mastery of vital energy.

to make rain fall.

a temple, and then
