not only the destruction

America's attacks against
the Japanese cities

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in August 1945

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated that the
catastrophic effects

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
of even a small atomic bomb
were horrific in the extreme.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>After the atomic bomb
blast that virtually

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
erased this city of 340,000

and shocked by the simultaneous
invasion of its territory

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:10%
by the Soviet Union, the
Japanese government quickly

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:10%
surrendered, thereby
ending World War II.

Less than a year
later the US military

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:84%
detonated two more atomic bombs
during Operation Crossroads,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
conducted at the newly created
Pacific Proving Grounds.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
By then the Soviets,
once allies of the US,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:84%
were considered a threat
to the Western democracies

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:90%
in the postwar world.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
President Harry Truman
and his advisors

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:84%
concluded that America's
possession of large numbers

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.600 align:middle line:84%
of atomic weapons would keep
the Russian communists in check,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and authorized crash programs
devoted to ongoing testing

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:90%
and mass production.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
On August 29, 1949,
the Soviet Union

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
detonated its own atomic bomb,
much sooner than expected.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The nuclear arms race
had begun in earnest.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
To make matters worse,
by the early 1950s

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
the newly invented
hydrogen bombs,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
some of them 1,000 times more
powerful than atomic weapons,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
began to be tested in
remote areas of the planet

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
by the new nuclear
superpowers and their allies.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Mankind's future
never looked bleaker.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Intriguingly, this
grim state of affairs

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
led to a still
unexplained mystery.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:10%
As difficult as this will be
for some people to accept,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:10%
evidence uncovered
by researchers

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:10%
confirms that technologically
advanced observers,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:10%
whose identity and
intentions remain unknown,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:10%
began to monitor the
nuclear standoff, almost

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:10%
from the start.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:10%
Declassified US
government documents

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:10%
reveal that as
early as December,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:10%
1948 incursions by
mysterious aerial objects,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:10%
later referred to as
UFOs, began to occur

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:10%
at American nuclear
laboratories, bomb storage

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:10%
depos, weapons test areas,
and, as time went on,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:10%
intercontinental
ballistic missile sites.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Particularly dramatic
are the incidents now

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
being openly discussed by
former US Air Force ICBM

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
launch officers, who were
stationed at various Strategic

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Air Command bases in
the 1960s and '70s.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
According to these highly
credible witnesses,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
on some occasions,
as the UFOs briefly

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
hovered over their
launch facilities,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear missiles
inexplicably malfunctioned.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:10%
The officers had been on alert
in their underground launch

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:10%
control capsules when they
received telephone calls

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:10%
from their security
guards at ground level,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:10%
saying that they were observing
one or more unidentified disk

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:10%
shaped craft
maneuvering in the sky.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Seconds later, as many
as 10 ICBMs suddenly

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
shut down, according to warning
lights on the officers' missile

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:84%
readiness consoles,
meaning that they could not

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
have been launched if the
President of the United States

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
had, at that moment, ordered
a nuclear attack on America's

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:90%
adversaries.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
These witnesses say
that their superiors

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
ordered them to keep
quiet about the incidents,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases
required them to sign

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
non-disclosure statements,
which stipulated

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:84%
severe legal penalties for
anyone who violated secrecy.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:10%
As a result of the harsh
security measures imposed

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:10%
upon them many of these
Air Force veterans

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:10%
waited decades before discussing
the nearly unbelievable

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:10%
and highly disturbing
incidents they had observed.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, a number of them
have finally stepped forward

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:90%
to reveal the truth.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
On September 27, 2010, a
leading UFO researcher,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Robert Hastings, and a former
Minuteman missile launch

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
officer, Robert Salas,
co-sponsored the UFOs and Nukes

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.130 align:middle line:84%
press conference in
Washington DC in an effort

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to bring the facts
to the public.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:10%
The event was widely
covered by the media,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:10%
not only in the United
States, but around the world.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:10%
CNN streamed it live.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:10%
And other major
news organizations

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:10%
published stories about
it later the same day.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Good afternoon.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:90%
My name is Robert Salas.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
In 1967 I was a first lieutenant
stationed at Malmstrom Air

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Force Base, Montana.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:90%
I was a missile launch officer.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometime in the evening
hours, on March 24,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.486 align:middle line:84%
I received a call from one of
my topside guards, the flight

00:06:20.486 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
security controller,
stating that they

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
had been observing strange
lights in the sky making

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:90%
odd maneuvers.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
He called back about
five minutes later.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
This time he was
screaming into the phone,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
saying they're looking at a red,
glowing object hovering just

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.410 align:middle line:90%
above our front gate.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Our missiles began
going into what's

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
called a no-go condition,
or unlaunchable.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Essentially they were disabled,
while this object was still

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:90%
hovering over our site.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:10%
>>Back in 1967 I was the officer
in charge of the communications

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:10%
center at the 28th Air Division
in Great Falls, Montana.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
In March of that
particular year I

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
can clearly recall
a message coming

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
through my communications
center which basically

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
said that a UFO did in fact
shut down several missile

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:90%
silos in Montana.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Robert Hastings
has devoted 40 years

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to seeking out and interviewing
US military veterans regarding

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
their UFO experiences at missile
sites and other nuclear weapons

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:90%
facilities.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:84%
His book, "UFOs and Nukes"
contains the testimony

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
of more than 100 of
those individuals.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Declassified US government
documents and witness testimony

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
from former or retired
US military personnel

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
confirm beyond any
doubt the reality

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
of ongoing UFO incursions
at nuclear weapons sites.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:10%
>>I was the Minuteman-III combat
crew commander at FE Warren Air

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:10%
Force Base, Wyoming.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
In 1976 my deputy Bill
and I were on alert.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:84%
We contacted our FSE, our
Flight Security Controller,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and asked him was
there something wrong?

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said right above him
was a big white object that

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.005 align:middle line:84%
was cigar shaped, 80 to 100 feet
above him, 40 to 50 feet long.

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Keep me appraised
of what's happening.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:90%
So we were talking for a while.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.416 align:middle line:84%
It stayed there
for, I don't know,

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:90%
a minute, a minute and a half.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And it slowly and very silently
moved along the access road.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
When we came up the
next morning the FSE

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
was in his chair in
the fetal position.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And we talked to him and
tried to calm him down.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't calm him
down oddly enough.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
We were called in by the
squadron commander again.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.235 align:middle line:84%
And he took whatever notes
my deputy made, tore them up.

00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So this didn't happen.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:90%
It's top secret.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:90%
And made us sign something.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Significantly,
dramatic UFO incidents

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
were also occurring at
nuclear missile facilities

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
in the former Soviet
Union, including

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
cases where the weapons
suddenly malfunctioned.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:10%
Documents obtained in Russia
by Western journalists

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:10%
in the 1990s, as well as
on the record statements

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:10%
by Soviet army veterans,
summarize the unsettling events

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:10%
in great detail.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:84%
These revelations made clear
that both American and Soviet

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
nuclear missiles were subjected
to ongoing surveillance,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and from time to time,
deliberate tampering

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
by whoever was piloting
the UFOs during

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
the long, tense confrontation
known as the Cold War.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:10%
Had that anxious standoff
between capitalism

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:10%
and communism suddenly
become a hot nuclear war,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of millions
of people would

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:10%
have been killed outright, and
a great many more, perhaps 1

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:10%
to 2 billion
worldwide, would have

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:10%
died over time, the result
of radiation illness,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:10%
exposure, and mass starvation.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, a great many species
and ecosystems on Earth

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
would have been
devastated by such a war.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But what were the mysterious
missile disruptions,

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
as described by American and
Soviet military veterans,

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:90%
meant to convey?

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Were they a demonstration of
the unknown observer's ability

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to interfere with
these weapons at will?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
If so, would they
have openly intervened

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to try to prevent a nuclear
exchange from occurring

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:90%
if hostilities seemed imminent?

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
To state the obvious, the
answers to these questions

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:90%
remain elusive even now.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But if all of this is true,
what exactly is going on?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Who or what is piloting
the amazing aerial craft

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:90%
we call UFOs?

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And why do they seemingly
have an intense interest

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
in monitoring and sometimes
disrupting our nuclear weapons

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
A brief review of the evidence
may provide a few clues.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:10%
US government documents
released through the Freedom

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:10%
of Information Act confirm that
unidentified aerial objects,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:10%
described as "flying disks,"
and "flying saucers,"

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:10%
began to be sighted around the
Los Alamos Atomic Laboratory

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:10%
in New Mexico, the birthplace
of nuclear weapons, as early

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.204 align:middle line:10%
as December, 1948.

00:11:34.204 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Three years earlier,
on July 16, 1945,

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
the lab had tested
the first atomic bomb

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
in the desert near
Alamogordo just

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
weeks before the devastating
attacks against Japan.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:10%
Although shrouded in
secrecy for decades,

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:10%
the declassified
documents reveal

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:10%
that UFOs appeared with
alarming frequency,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:10%
not only at Los Alamos, but
also at its sister laboratory,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:10%
Sandia, in Albuquerque,
throughout the 1950s.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:10%
Other declassified documents
discuss ongoing UFO sightings

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:10%
at the Oak Ridge Nuclear
Laboratory in Tennessee,

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:10%
the Hanford Plutonium Processing
Plant in Washington state,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:10%
and the Savannah River Complex,
another plutonium manufacturing

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:10%
site in South Carolina.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:10%
While the local and
even national media

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:10%
occasionally published
stories about these incidents,

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:10%
the vast majority of
the American public

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:10%
had no idea that they were
so frequent and widespread.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, according to
military intelligence officers,

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:10%
a worrisome pattern
had begun to emerge.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:10%
On July 1st, 1952,
"Look" magazine

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:10%
featured an article, "Hunt
for the Flying Saucer,"

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:10%
about the Air Force's new UFO
investigations group, Project

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Blue Book, and noted that its
director, First Lieutenant

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:10%
Edward Ruppelt had plotted
63 unexplained sightings

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:10%
on a map of the United States.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
At that point, it was
discovered that a,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
quote, "ominous
correlation" existed

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.080 align:middle line:84%
between some of the
sightings and the location

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of various atomic
weapons installations.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:10%
Later that year the CIA took
notice of the situation,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:10%
as this memorandum reveals.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Dr. H. Marshall Chadwell,
Assistant Director

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
of the agency's Office of
Scientific Intelligence wrote,

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:84%
quote, "Sightings of unexplained
objects at great altitudes,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and traveling at high speeds
in the vicinity of major US

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
defense installations
are of such nature

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that they are not attributable
to natural phenomena or known

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.390 align:middle line:90%
types of aerial vehicles."

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
UFOs also visited the newly
created Nevada Proving Ground,

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
located 60 miles northwest
of Las Vegas, where

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
new and improved atomic
devices were being tested.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:10%
Civilians living near
the proving ground

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:10%
often observed the
aerial disks, sometimes

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:10%
flying in large formations,
and subsequently notify the Air

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:10%
Force and the local media.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
US army personnel

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
engaged in field maneuvers
at the test site,

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
designed to expose them to
atomic battlefield conditions,

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:90%
also reported seeing the UFOs.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, other sightings were
occurring at the remote Pacific

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:84%
proving grounds, where
ongoing tests of the far more

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
destructive hydrogen
bombs were taking place,

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
as the US tried to outpace the
Soviets in the new technology

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:90%
of warfare.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
The chief purpose
of the nuclear tests

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
was to create a powerful
but lightweight bomb that

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:84%
could be easily transported
aboard an aircraft,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:84%
the primary delivery
system during that era.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Had the United States been
attacked by the Soviet Union,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the US Air Force planned to
launch 100 of strategic bombers

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
against that country and
its communist allies.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Flying over the
Arctic region, they

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
would deliver their deadly
payloads a few hours later.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
Soviet bombers would

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
be racing toward North
America and Western Europe,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
carrying their own
hydrogen bombs,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
intent on massive retaliation.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:84%
If this were not enough,
the nuclear standoff

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
entered a new and even
more menacing phase

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.950 align:middle line:84%
in the early 1960s, with
the first deployment

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of intercontinental
ballistic missiles.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Traveling at more than
15,000 miles per hour,

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
these space age
weapons could deliver

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
their massively
destructive warheads

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
to targets on the other side
of the globe in less than half

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:84%
That shockingly brief
period was later reduced

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to less than 10 minutes, once
US and Soviet missile carrying

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:84%
submarines began to be deployed
just off each other's coasts.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:10%
Nuclear Armageddon,
if it came to pass,

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:10%
would burst upon the world
with sudden savagery,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:10%
against which there would
be no possible defense.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps predictably,
declassified documents

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:10%
reveal that UFO sightings
at nuclear missile launch

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:37.110 align:middle line:10%
facilities began to
occur as early as 1962.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>>My crew was on alert
at missile complex seven.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:10%
Major Gilbert, my
crew commander, and I

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:10%
were manning the launch console.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
We got a call from
the site six crew

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
commander saying that
there's something

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.011 align:middle line:90%
hovering above his sight.

00:16:57.011 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And he asked us to go topside
and see what we could see.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So Major Gilbert sent
our three enlisted men

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
to what we call
the cap, which was

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
the topside of the
[INAUDIBLE] control center.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:84%
They reported to us that they
saw a light above site six

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that rapidly accelerated,
and stopped instantly

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.240 align:middle line:84%
above the area where
sight eight was located,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:90%
and went back and forth.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:90%
It was instant go, instant stop.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That object did things that
no airplane, helicopter,

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
or any other system that we
had in existence could do.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:90%
It had to be not of this Earth.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Air Force security personnel
guarding these sensitive sites

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:84%
reported seeing
unknown aerial objects,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
usually described as
disk shaped, maneuvering

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.620 align:middle line:84%
at low altitude, and sometimes
even hovering over launch silos

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and launch control
facilities at every ICBM base

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Often the UFOs were
tracked on radar,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
performing maneuvers vastly
beyond the capability

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:90%
of any manmade aircraft.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Experienced radar
personnel were stunned

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:84%
as the objects flew
thousands of miles per hour,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.865 align:middle line:84%
made sharp angled turns, and
instantly stopped in midair.

00:18:26.865 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
The mysterious intruders
were frequently

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
chased by Air Force
interceptors, which

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
had been scrambled to
protect the missiles

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:90%
from possible sabotage.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
So far as is known, the UFOs
always escaped unscathed,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:84%
usually by vastly
increasing their speed

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and leaving the
fighters far behind.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:10%
Baffled military
officials had to deal

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:10%
with these unexplained
and alarming incidents

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:10%
on an ongoing basis, while
trying their best to keep

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:10%
the facts from leaking out
to their fellow Americans,

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:10%
many of whom believed
the UFO phenomenon to be

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:10%
a nonsensical subject,
having no basis in reality.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:10%
This skeptical
attitude was actively

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:10%
fostered by the government's own
policy of ridicule and denial,

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:10%
as implemented by members
of Project Blue Book, who

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:10%
routinely dismissed
credible, bona fide UFO

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:10%
sightings as the
misidentifications

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:10%
of natural phenomena,
or manmade aircraft.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Over time this practice led to
a widespread public backlash

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:84%
against the US
government, and its weak

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes ridiculous
explanations for the sightings.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, behind
the scenes, UFOs

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:10%
began to appear at
missile test ranges,

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:10%
often during launches designed
to improve the performance

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:10%
and reliability of
America's ICBMs,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:10%
and the deadly
warheads they carried.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:10%
Occasionally those
aboard the UFOs

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:10%
did more than watch the tests.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:84%
While the exact date
remains uncertain,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
sometime in the fall
of 1964 an incident

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
occurred at Vandenberg Air
Force Base, California,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:84%
which has come to be the best
known, most astonishing example

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
of deliberate UFO interference
with our nuclear weapons

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Although the case is still
classified top secret,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
a former Air Force
officer, Dr. Robert Jacobs,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:90%
has openly discussed it.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.620 align:middle line:84%
At the time
Lieutenant Jacobs, who

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:84%
was assigned to the 1369th
photographic squadron,

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and held the title
Officer in Charge

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:84%
of Photo Instrumentation,
was tasked

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.110 align:middle line:84%
with filming missile launches
from a remote mountaintop

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:84%
site on California's
Big Sur coastline,

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
using a powerful,
telescopic camera.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The ascending ICBMs
would initially

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
fill the camera frame,
permitting a detailed

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
view of engine
performance, staging,

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and other aspects
of a given launch,

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
as they raced out over
the Pacific Ocean.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Following one such test
launch, Lieutenant Jacobs

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:84%
was unexpectedly told to report
to the office of Major Florenz

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Mansmann, a photographic
analyst assigned

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
to Vandenberg's Office of the
Chief Scientist First Strategic

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Aerospace Division.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Upon arriving he noticed
two mysterious men

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
in gray suits, who he later
learned were CIA officers.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
A motion picture
projector had been set up,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and without explanation
Major Mansmann turned it on,

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:90%
telling Jacobs, watch this.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Jacobs, later a
university professor,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:90%
describes what happened next.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>On the screen was
the film we had shot.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%
The nose cones separate.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:10%
The chaff flew out
in front of it.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.320 align:middle line:10%
We saw this as
obviously reflections

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:10%
of light rippling like that.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we saw the dummy
warhead flying along.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
It's going between 6,000
and 8,000 miles an hour

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's on the fringe of space.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, into
that frame, an object

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
flew in, chasing the chaff,
the warhead, and so on,

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:84%
at the same speed, and, in polar
orbit, it fired a beam of light

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:90%
at the warhead.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:90%
The beam of light struck that.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
The object flew up, shot
another beam of light

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
at the dummy
warhead, went around,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.105 align:middle line:84%
shot another beam
of light at it,

00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
went down, shot a beam of light,
and then flew out the same way

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:90%
it had come in.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
At which time the dummy
warhead fell out of the frame.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
The lights came on, and
Major Mansmann said to me,

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
were you guys screwing
around up there?

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no sir.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.610 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what was that?

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it looks
like we got a UFO.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
Lieutenant Jacobs, you

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
are never to speak
of this again.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It never happened.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Decades later Dr. Mansmann, by
then a researcher at Stanford

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
University, informed
Dr. Jacobs that after he

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
had left the room the two CIA
officers quickly confiscated

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
the film of the
amazing incident,

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
telling Mansmann that it
was classified top secret.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Mansmann also confirmed, in
letters to various researchers,

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that before the film
was whisked away,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.640 align:middle line:84%
he had conducted
an extensive frame

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:84%
by frame analysis of it using
a magnifier, which revealed

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:90%
the UFO in great detail.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:84%
He wrote, quote, "The
shape was a classic disk.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:84%
The center seemed to
be a raised bubble.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
The entire lower saucer
shape was glowing,

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and seemed to be
rotating slowly.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.930 align:middle line:84%
At the point of beam
release, the object

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:84%
turned like it was required
to be in a position

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:90%
to fire from a platform.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
The assumption was, at that
time, extraterrestrial."

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Responding to the retired
Major's revelations,

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jacobs wrote, quote,
"Those beams of light

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
were a warning, a shot
fired across the bow

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:90%
of our nuclear silliness ship."

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:10%
Then on August 1, 1965, a
dramatic, large scale UFO

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:10%
incursion took place
at FE Warren Air Force

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:10%
Base in Wyoming, as this
declassified report confirms.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:10%
Dozens of sightings of
disk shaped craft cavorting

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:10%
at low altitude over
minuteman missile silos,

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:10%
known as launch
facilities, were reported

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:10%
by the Air Force security
personnel guarding them.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Former launch
officer J. Earnshaw

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
has discussed his involvement
in one such incident that night.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:10%
>>I was in command
of capsule echo one

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:10%
at Warren Air Force Base.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I got a call about
3:30 in the morning,

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in that time, from
the flight security controller

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
above, who said
that, sir, there are

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.320 align:middle line:90%
some strange objects out there.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that he had observed,

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:84%
along with the rest of
his response team members,

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.350 align:middle line:84%
what looked like five to
six oblong lights stacked

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
on top of one another, just
outside the gate at echo one.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem to cause
any particular damage.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem to put
out any beams of light,

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:84%
They simply were
there, stacked up.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It was rather a benign
incident at the time.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:90%
The paperwork all disappeared.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Over the next two years
similar UFO incursions

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
also took place at Minot Air
Force Base, North Dakota,

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and Ellsworth Air Force
Base, South Dakota.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Although those
disturbing incidents

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
were reported in official
records at the time,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and occasionally leaked to the
media, many of the details only

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:84%
emerged decades later in the
testimony of former missile

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:90%
launch officers.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:10%
>>I was on duty at echo, which
our squadron command post,

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:10%
we had strike teams respond
to alarms from the missiles.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%
They were three to
five miles away.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.045 align:middle line:84%
And they jumped in their trucks
and went roaring out there.

00:26:22.045 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And they called
me back and said,

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
sir, for lack of a
better description,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
there's a flying saucer
hovering over that missile.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beam of reddish
light going down to it.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I assume they were taking
data with that beam.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't destructive
as far as I know.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It had to be a data
collection thing.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the canned the
warhead, or something or other.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Although the Air Force
could not yet know it,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
the most dramatic
nuclear weapons

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:84%
related UFO incidents
were about to occur.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:10%
>>During the pre-departure
crew briefing

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:10%
it was mentioned that some
missiles that November

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:10%
flight had gone off alert.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.160 align:middle line:84%
We reached the launch
control facility.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We entered the
gate, after giving

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:90%
the appropriate password.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And the above ground
personnel briefed us

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:90%
on what had happened.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And essentially we were
told by the site manager

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that an object had been sighted
up the windows, with flashing

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
lights, and was probably about
80 to 100 feet in diameter.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It then went to the main
gate, where it hovered.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we debriefed the
underground launch crew,

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.870 align:middle line:84%
they indicated that all the
missiles that they controlled

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
had gone off on
alert at the time

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that object had been hovering
next to the main gate.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:10%
My crew commander,
Major Tolrud, told me

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:10%
that he had received
a call overnight,

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:10%
evidently while I was on
rest break below ground,

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:10%
and saying that we
as a crew were never

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.580 align:middle line:10%
to speak about this again.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
This was a very
serious incident.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something to take
our nuclear tipped missiles

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
off alert, it was something that
we had never been prepared for.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
The same year that
these amazing events

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:84%
were unfolding in secrecy,
Secretary of the Air Force

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Harold Brown appeared before
a congressional hearing,

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and dismissed the idea
that information about UFOs

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:84%
was being kept from
the American public.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>We have not been
hiding anything.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:20.046 align:middle line:84%
The investigations
have been made public.

00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:23.539 align:middle line:84%
The explanations of those where
there is a clear explanation

00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:25.018 align:middle line:90%
have been made public.

00:28:25.018 --> 00:28:28.100 align:middle line:84%
The hearing this morning was
public for just that reason.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Brown's claims have
now been discredited.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But the strict security measures
imposed on military witnesses

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:84%
at the time meant
that decades would

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
pass before the public learned
the facts about UFO activity

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%
at nuclear missile sites.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
In any case, the
next known incident,

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
at Malmstrom Air Force Base,
Montana, in March 1967,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:84%
left no doubt that
those aboard the UFOs

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:84%
were intent on disrupting the
functionality of American ICBMs

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:90%
in their underground silos.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
On March 16, at Echo Flight,
a missile security guard

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:84%
reported that a large
round object had suddenly

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
appeared in the sky and was
hovering at low altitude,

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:84%
directly over one of
the missile silos.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:10%
Moments later, the
entire group of 10

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:10%
ICBMs mysteriously
malfunctioned.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
This startling fact has been
confirmed by one of the launch

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
officers on alert that day, now
retired Colonel Walter Figel,

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.390 align:middle line:84%
who spoke about the incident
during a taped telephone

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:84%
conversation with
Robert Hastings in 2008.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Figel said that in response to
the missile guard's UFO report

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:84%
he had sent out two security
alert teams, one of which

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%
confirmed the presence
of the object.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.166 align:middle line:84%
>>The strike team that
went out, one of the two

00:29:52.166 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
claimed that they saw
something over the site.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.495 align:middle line:90%
>>How did they describe that?

00:29:55.495 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>He just said a
large, round object.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Directly over the LF?

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Directly over the site.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>But Figel was not
the only one to be

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:07.060 align:middle line:84%
told that a UFO was in the
vicinity during the incident.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Former Minuteman
electromechanical technician

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Henry Barlow, who helped restart
some of the stricken missiles,

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
was informed that the mysterious
aerial craft had actually

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:90%
caused the problem.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Job control called and said we
have a problem at Echo Flight.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And four or five
missiles, or six missiles,

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:90%
just shut down simultaneously.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And we want you to go
to the nearest site,

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.162 align:middle line:84%
penetrate the site and
see what's going on.

00:30:35.162 --> 00:30:38.734 align:middle line:84%
So on our way to the
site they had called

00:30:38.734 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and said that the other
four missiles had shut down,

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:84%
so that all of them
are now shut down.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
At that time they said
UFO activity in the area.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.817 align:middle line:84%
And we had heard this on
and off for many times

00:30:49.817 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:84%
when we were out at
the missile sites,

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that job control
would call and say,

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.540 align:middle line:84%
we have reports of UFO
activity in your area.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Keep your eyes open.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think we covered
three or four sites.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were sending other
teams out from the base.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
We had to go to echo one
to stay for the night

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:84%
there and get eight
hours of sleep

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
before we headed
back to the base.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So when we got in
there there was hardly

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:84%
room to walk in there because
there was so much brass.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And we heard that
there was a UFO spotted

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.870 align:middle line:84%
over echo two, which is the
most northern sight in the Echo

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Flight.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1997 missile
engineer Robert Kaminski,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
who headed the Boeing company
team tasked with investigating

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:84%
the missile shutdown
incident at Echo Flight,

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.880 align:middle line:84%
wrote to research
Jim Klotz, saying

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that no prosaic cause for
the failures could be found.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, the
retired engineer

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
also said he had been
informed that a UFO was

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:58.430 align:middle line:84%
responsible for the
missile malfunctions.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But the excitement
was not yet over.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
A second ICBM shutdown incident
occurred eight days later,

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:10.530 align:middle line:84%
on March 24, 1967,
at Oscar Flight,

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:84%
according to former Minuteman
missile launch officer Captain

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Robert Salas, who was on
alert when it occurred.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:84%
This was the event
discussed by Salas

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:84%
at the September 2010 press
conference in Washington DC.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Salas' testimony has been
confirmed by former Minuteman

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:84%
missile targeting officer
Captain Robert Jamieson, who

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.300 align:middle line:84%
helped retarget some of
the Oscar Flight ICBMs.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>In March of 1967, I was
on alert for dispatch.

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And that evening I got
a call from job control,

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
saying a missile had gone
down in Oscar Flight.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Go out and restart it.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So I had called
my team together.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:90%
We went down to the hangar.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I was told that a UFO caused
all 10 missiles in Oscar Flight

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:90%
to go down.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Although this ominous
situation undoubtedly

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:84%
concerned those in the
know at the Pentagon,

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.560 align:middle line:84%
the chief of Project Blue
Book, Major Hector Quintanilla,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.830 align:middle line:84%
nevertheless
presented a brave face

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
when he spoke with
reporters in response

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to a public uproar over
nationwide UFO sightings.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:84%
After almost 20 years, and
after having investigated

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:84%
over 9,000 cases,
the Air Force has

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:84%
determined the UFO
phenomena does not

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:84%
present a threat to the national
security of the United States.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:10%
>>These same claims were made
when the Air Force announced

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:37.680 align:middle line:10%
the closure of Blue Book in
December 1969, at which time

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:10%
it again emphasized
that no evidence existed

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:10%
to indicate that UFOs posed
a threat to the country's

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:10%
security.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>While many Americans may
have believed this to be true,

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
in reality the UFOs continued
to monitor our nuclear weapons

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:84%
As this Reuters news
agency article confirms.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:84%
In August 1973, one of
the mysterious craft,

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:84%
dubbed a "ghost
ship," was tracked

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:84%
on radar, maneuvering near a
dummy nuclear warhead in flight

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:84%
as it raced toward a
splash down in the Pacific

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Ocean near Kwajalein Atoll.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.739 align:middle line:84%
This story cited information
from unnamed scientists

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:21.429 align:middle line:84%
working for the US Army's
ballistic missile program.

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:24.722 align:middle line:84%
This intriguing report suggests
that the earlier Big Sur

00:34:24.722 --> 00:34:28.520 align:middle line:84%
incident, as revealed by former
US Air Force Lieutenant Robert

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.639 align:middle line:84%
Jacobs, and retired
Major Florenz Mansmann,

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.860 align:middle line:90%
was not unique.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
Although this weapons test a
decade later was apparently

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:40.980 align:middle line:84%
successful, it's clear
that UFOs have maneuvered

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.179 align:middle line:84%
near our dummy nuclear
warheads in flight

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.690 align:middle line:90%
on more than one occasion.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.760 align:middle line:84%
In the years that followed,
other UFO incidents

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:84%
continued to occur
at various nukes

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
related locations
throughout the US.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.210 align:middle line:10%
According to
declassified documents,

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:10%
two B-52 bomber bases,
Loring Air Force Base,

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:10%
Maine, and Wordsmith
Air Force Base,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.840 align:middle line:10%
Michigan, were targeted
by unknown aerial craft

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.100 align:middle line:10%
in late October 1975.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Although initial
reports referred

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to unidentified
helicopters, one witness

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.910 align:middle line:84%
at Loring, Sergeant
Steven Eichner,

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:84%
later wrote that he
had observed, quote,

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:84%
"an elongated football,
as long as four cars,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and reddish orange
in color, briefly

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:84%
hovering near the nuclear
weapons storage area."

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:90%
The object then zoomed away.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.480 align:middle line:84%
One week later, back at
Malmstrom Air Force Base,

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.470 align:middle line:84%
as many as seven UFOs were
sighted and tracked on radar,

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
as they intermittently
maneuvered near, and hovered

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.840 align:middle line:84%
above, various minuteman missile
sites over a several hour

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.470 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.860 align:middle line:84%
According to numerous North
American Aerospace Defense

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Command log entries, released
via the Freedom of Information

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Act, the UFOs were also
unsuccessfully pursued

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:84%
by F-106 jet fighters before
finally leaving the vicinity.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the craft was apparently
close enough to the ground

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to be described
by security forces

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:84%
as a, quote, "orange
white disk object."

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
At the Pentagon the National
Military Command Center

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:84%
was so alarmed by
the UFO incursions

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:26.140 align:middle line:84%
at Strategic Air Command
bomber and missile bases

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that a security option
three order was issued,

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.980 align:middle line:84%
placing the Air Force's
entire nuclear weapons

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:90%
force on high alert.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:39.040 align:middle line:10%
Despite official efforts to
suppress the facts, all of this

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:10%
eventually became known, as
military and intelligence

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:10%
agency files were
involuntarily released

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.640 align:middle line:10%
to the public via the
Freedom of Information Act.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.600 align:middle line:84%
If all of this were not enough,
the next major UFO event

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.180 align:middle line:90%
really rocked the Pentagon.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:84%
In late 1980, at the
RAF Bentwaters' Base

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:84%
in Suffolk, England, then
leased by the US Air Force,

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:84%
a series of bizarre
incidents left no doubt

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that something very
strange was taking place.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:84%
In the early hours
of December 26,

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:84%
a small group of Air
Force security policeman

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:21.360 align:middle line:84%
noticed an unusual light in
nearby Rendlesham Forest.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They approached it on
foot, only to discover

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.545 align:middle line:84%
a strange, triangular
shaped craft.

00:37:26.545 --> 00:37:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.110 align:middle line:84%
After an indeterminate
period of time,

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:37.920 align:middle line:84%
the unknown object silently
raced skyward and disappeared.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Two nights later, RAF
Bentwaters' deputy base

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
commander, Lieutenant
Colonel Charles Halt,

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.650 align:middle line:84%
was informed that another
mysterious light had suddenly

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:90%
appeared in the forest.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Halt quickly assembled a small
team of security policemen

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:90%
to investigate.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:84%
After some time the
men observed an object

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:84%
that looked like a large eyeball
moving through the trees.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:84%
At one point material
resembling molten metal

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.270 align:middle line:90%
was seen dripping from it.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly the object
split into five, smaller,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:84%
disk shaped craft,
which silently

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.130 align:middle line:90%
scattered in all directions.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:84%
A short time later
another disk raced

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:84%
toward Colonel
Halt and his team,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:84%
abruptly stopped above them,
and directed a laser like beam

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.080 align:middle line:84%
toward the ground
very near their feet.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.680 align:middle line:10%
After a few seconds
the beam clicked off,

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.550 align:middle line:10%
and the craft rapidly
receded into the sky,

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:35.130 align:middle line:10%
moving in the direction of the
RAF Bentwaters' weapons storage

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.570 align:middle line:10%
area, which was at
the time the largest

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.160 align:middle line:10%
American tactical nuclear
bomb depot in Europe.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:84%
As this was occurring,
Colonel Halt

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.030 align:middle line:84%
began hearing excited radio
chatter from security guards

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:84%
at the weapons
facility indicating

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that the UFO was
sending down laser

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:84%
like beams into or near
the storage bunker complex.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.340 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
In 2007 Robert Hastings
located and interviewed

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.930 align:middle line:84%
the two retired Air Force
air traffic controllers who

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:11.290 align:middle line:84%
had been on duty at the
Bentwaters Tower that week.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:10%
Ike Barker and Jim Carey
divulged for the first time,

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:19.070 align:middle line:10%
they had actually tracked
a bona fide UFO on radar

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.886 align:middle line:10%
the night that Colonel
Halt was in the woods.

00:39:21.886 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>I was just sitting there.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to see a
dot come on the scope.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And it just went like
one dot at the beginning.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Then another dot.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And another dot.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So the scope was
120 miles across.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:84%
It was just phenomenal for
me to see it go that fast.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.770 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden here it
come back across again.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It went one, two, and then it
made an immediate right hand

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.630 align:middle line:84%
turn and came right
towards the base.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just said,
that can't be one of ours.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.600 align:middle line:84%
No Jet at that speed can make
an immediate right hand turn.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Just absolutely phenomenal.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not like any radar
target I've ever seen.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.280 align:middle line:84%
When the sweep
would hit the target

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.160 align:middle line:84%
you would have the
entire back of it

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:90%
would be like a solid line.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Traveling at an extremely
high rate of speed,

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
it passed over the control
tower, and then it stopped.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anything in my life

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:84%
like the maneuverability that
happened with this object.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.660 align:middle line:90%
It was an orange-ish color.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It sort of popped into
my mind at the time

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that somebody is flying
a basketball out here.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:84%
There were like lights
around the center of it.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't like running
lights or navigational lights.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.220 align:middle line:84%
It was more like portholes, and
then you were seeing the light

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.390 align:middle line:90%
from the inside coming out.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't flashing
lights or anything.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:84%
But it hovered momentarily,
reversed its course,

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and went back out at a
high rate of a speed.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Moreover, given the dramatic
incident at the weapons storage

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:59.220 align:middle line:84%
area, when one of those UFOs
reportedly directed laser

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.020 align:middle line:84%
like beams down
into the facility,

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
it becomes clear that this
case had a nuclear weapons

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.350 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Significantly, another
nukes related incident

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.920 align:middle line:84%
in the former Soviet Union is
nearly identical to Bentwaters.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.920 align:middle line:10%
Government documents, obtained
by Western journalists

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:10%
after the collapse
of the Soviet regime,

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.630 align:middle line:10%
confirmed numerous cases of
UFO activity in that country

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:10%
during the Cold War era,
including one at the Kapustin

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:10%
Yar military complex.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:84%
On the night of July
28, 1989, a disk shaped

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.650 align:middle line:84%
object with a dome was observed
by dozens of Soviet army

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:44.560 align:middle line:84%
personnel as it briefly hovered
over the base's nuclear missile

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.080 align:middle line:90%
warhead depot.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:84%
According to one KGB report, as
the stunned witnesses watched,

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the UFO directed
laser like beams

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.180 align:middle line:84%
onto the roof of a building, in
which those weapons were kept,

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:90%
before silently racing away.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Another incident
in the Soviet Union

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.570 align:middle line:84%
seven years earlier
was even more shocking.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:13.070 align:middle line:84%
On October 4, 1982, a huge
flying disk apparently

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:84%
activated several
nuclear missiles, which

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:90%
were then preparing to launch.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.310 align:middle line:10%
According to the Soviet
ministry of defense documents,

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:25.700 align:middle line:10%
secured by American television
investigative reporter George

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.580 align:middle line:10%
Knapp, the UFO appeared over an
intermediate range missile base

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.550 align:middle line:10%
near the Ukrainian town
of [? Bilo Koroviev ? ].

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:84%
At one point, down in the
underground launch control

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
capsule, several
missiles suddenly

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:90%
went into countdown mode.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Although no one had input
the authorization codes,

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:84%
the missiles were
preparing to launch.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Then after 15
terrifying seconds,

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.070 align:middle line:84%
the anomaly ceased,
and everything returned

00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:90%
to normal operational status.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.720 align:middle line:84%
This potentially
disastrous incident

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:84%
was nearly identical to one
reported to Robert Hastings

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.100 align:middle line:84%
by former US Air Force
launch officer David

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Schuur, who said that a UFO
had activated the launch

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.640 align:middle line:84%
sequence in several of
his minuteman missiles

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.800 align:middle line:84%
at Minot Air Force Base, North
Dakota, one night in 1966.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>As this object passed
over the missile site

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.509 align:middle line:84%
we would start getting erratic
indications on that missile.

00:43:26.509 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The bad thing was we also
got a launch indicator.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Does that mean that the launch
sequence has been triggered?

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>That means that the missile
has received a launch signal.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.570 align:middle line:10%
>>In that case Schuur
and his commander

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:10%
had to flip an inhibit
switch to disrupt

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.650 align:middle line:10%
the unauthorized countdown.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But were those aboard
the UFOs actually trying

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.000 align:middle line:90%
to start a nuclear war?

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.790 align:middle line:10%
>>Having investigated
these incidents for decades

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.860 align:middle line:10%
my opinion is that those who
pilot the UFOs are visitors

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.780 align:middle line:10%
from elsewhere who are engaged
in these provocative actions

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.570 align:middle line:10%
at American and Russian
nuclear missile sites

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:08.300 align:middle line:10%
to send us a message that we
humans are playing with fire,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:10%
that to engage in nuclear
warfare is essentially suicide.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Importantly, these
dramatic incidents

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.400 align:middle line:84%
continue to occur long after
the end of the Cold War.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Several US Air Force veterans
have reported new UFO

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:28.180 align:middle line:84%
incursions at nuclear missile
sites and weapons storage areas

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.060 align:middle line:90%
in the very recent past.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.340 align:middle line:10%
The most important case
occurred on October 23, 2010.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>This is CNN, breaking news.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>The breaking news
involves a power failure

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that shut down a major part of
the US nuclear missile arsenal.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to our Pentagon
correspondent Chris Lawrence.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Wow, Chris.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:50.977 align:middle line:90%
What do we know?

00:44:50.977 --> 00:44:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Well Wolf, this happened
out in Warren Air Force

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Base out in Wyoming.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And bottom line is this.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.270 align:middle line:84%
For less than an hour,
about an hour on Saturday,

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the base lost primary
communication with about 50

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.810 align:middle line:84%
intercontinental
ballistic missiles.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Although widespread media
coverage of the incident

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.960 align:middle line:10%
contained no hint
of any UFO reports,

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.390 align:middle line:10%
a subsequent investigation
yielded intriguing information

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:10%
about a series of still
unexplained sightings

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.570 align:middle line:10%
occurring during the
communications disruption.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.060 align:middle line:84%
According to confidential
Air Force sources

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.200 align:middle line:84%
known to Robert Hastings,
various missile maintenance

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.820 align:middle line:84%
teams responding to
the problem reported

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.750 align:middle line:84%
observing a huge,
cigar shaped object

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:40.180 align:middle line:84%
maneuvering in the sky
above the missile field.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.960 align:middle line:84%
These persons emphatically
state that the craft was not

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.890 align:middle line:84%
a blimp, because no passenger
gondola, propellers,

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.770 align:middle line:84%
or stabilizing tail
fins were visible.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was no corporate
logo or other advertising

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.850 align:middle line:90%
on its hull.

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The anomalous
nature of the object

00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:01.270 align:middle line:84%
was all but confirmed when these
teams returned to the base.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:04.850 align:middle line:84%
According to Hastings' sources,
the entire missile maintenance

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.170 align:middle line:84%
squadron was sternly
admonished by its commander

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:84%
not to talk to
journalists or researchers

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
about, quote, "the things
they may or may not

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.070 align:middle line:90%
have seen in the sky."

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.400 align:middle line:10%
Despite these revelations
the Air Force officially

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.500 align:middle line:10%
maintains that the massive
communications disruption

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.960 align:middle line:10%
was caused by an
improperly replaced

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:31.110 align:middle line:10%
circuit card, following repairs
on a weapons system processor.

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, key personnel
who were in a position

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.770 align:middle line:84%
to know the facts have described
multiple independent UFO

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:42.680 align:middle line:84%
reports during the incident,
which were allegedly suppressed

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:90%
by command level officers.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.680 align:middle line:84%
This program has only
scratched the surface.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:10%
Declassified documents
and eyewitness testimony

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:57.310 align:middle line:10%
suggest that incidents involving
UFO activity at nuclear weapons

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:10%
sites now number
in the hundreds.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.140 align:middle line:10%
Robert Hastings has
urged military veterans

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.820 align:middle line:10%
to contact him at
his website regarding

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.260 align:middle line:10%
their knowledge of these events
so that a more complete picture

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.850 align:middle line:10%
of the situation can emerge.

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.980 align:middle line:84%
He believes that
people everywhere

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.400 align:middle line:90%
have a right to know the facts.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>This is history,
hidden history

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.200 align:middle line:84%
to be sure, but
tremendously important.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Scientists laugh at UFOs.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.310 align:middle line:90%
The media generally ignore them.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Billions of people worldwide
think this subject is nonsense.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what has been
unfolding behind the scenes

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:40.110 align:middle line:84%
for more than half a century is
nothing less than astounding.

00:47:40.110 --> 00:48:20.037 align:middle line:90%
