00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I WAS THE ONE WHO'S AT FAULT,
IT'S NOT DAD'S FAULT.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:90%
ALL RIGHT?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:90%
DON'T GULP, PLEASE.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:90%
AND JUST USE A GLASS.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
DID DAD CALL?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:90%
NO.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
WHY? WHAT ARE
YOU TWO PLOTTING?

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:90%
IT'S NOTHING.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:90%
OH, WATCH OUT.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I LEFT THE VACUUM
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, SORRY.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:90%
[KNOCKS] HI

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:90%
GEOFF TAYLOR.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU REMEMBER,
WE SPOKE ONCE ON THE PHONE.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:90%
YES, YOU'RE ALEX'S FATHER.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:90%
HE'S A VERY SWEET KID.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
THANK YOU.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
HIM BEING ON CROSS COUNTRY TEAM.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
OH, GEE, I'M SORRY, MR. TAYLOR.
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TRAINING.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:84%
OUR FIRST RACE
IS VERY SOON.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
WELL, YOU TOLD ME
YOU'D CALL ME

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
BEFORE YOU STARTED
TRAINING.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:90%
I'VE JUST BEEN REALLY BUSY...

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
WELL, THIS IS KIND OF
A SPECIAL CASE.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
LOOK, IF HE'S
AS FAST AS YOU SAY HE IS,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I JUST DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYONE
TO RUN WITH HIM.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
MY BEST RUNNERS, THEY'RE
TRAINING FOR THEIR OWN RACES.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:84%
SO, IF I FIND SOMEONE
TO RUN WITH HIM,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:90%
HE CAN BE ON THE TEAM?

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:90%
I DIDN'T SAY THAT,

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
AND WE WOULD HAVE TO MEET
THE ENTRY

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
AND INSURANCE
CONSIDERATIONS, SO...

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.720 align:middle line:90%
YEAH, I MEAN, I GUESS

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU FOUND SOMEONE
FAST ENOUGH TO RUN WITH HIM,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:90%
WHO WENT TO THIS SCHOOL,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:84%
AND IS NOT ALREADY
ON THE CROSS COUNTRY TEAM,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:90%
HE COULD TRY OUT.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:90%
OKAY, THANKS.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:90%
TRY OUT!

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:90%
THANK YOU.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I JUST DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU GET HIS HOPES UP.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I'M NOT GETTING
ANYBODY'S HOPES UP,

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
HE'S GOING TO
MAKE THE TEAM.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I DON'T WANT TO
SEE HIM GET HURT.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:90%
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET HURT.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW,
YOU SAID THE SAME THING

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
WHEN HE WANTED TO GO
TO HIGH SCHOOL

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
WITHOUT A GUIDE DOG
OR AN ASSISTANT,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:84%
AND HE MEMORIZED THAT PLACE
JUST LIKE HE DID AT HOME,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
AND HE'S FINE.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
HE'S GOT JULIE
TO WATCH OUT FOR HIM THERE,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, IT'S
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
LOOK, HE'S
GOING TO GET HURT.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:90%
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET HURT.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW WHAT, THESE ARE
THE KIDS WHO ARE HURT.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:90%
GEOFF, ALL I'M SAYING

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT I DON'T
THINK IT'S RIGHT

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
TO GIVE HIM DREAMS
OF COMPETING

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
IN SOME SPORT IN WHICH
HE CAN NEVER POSSIBLY WIN

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT IS
SO DANGEROUS FOR HIM--

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:90%
IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY,

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
WE'D BE WRAPPING HIM UP
IN BUBBLE WRAP ALL DAY.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUFFLED ARGUMENTS CONTINUE]

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I WANT TO GIVE MY SON

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
EVERY OPPORTUNITY
IN LIFE I CAN,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:84%
TO SUCCEED
OR TO FAIL.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:84%
IF HE WANTS TO RUN
CROSS COUNTRY,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S WHAT HE'S
GOING TO DO,

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
HE'S GOING TO RUN
CROSS COUNTRY.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:84%
IF HE WANTS TO START
SKEET SHOOTING, THEN--

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
OKAY, AND WHO IS
GOING TO RUN WITH HIM?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:90%
YOU, MR. USAIN BOLT?

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN'T EVEN
KEEP UP WITH HIM NOW!

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I HAVE A VERY CLEVER PLAN.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:84%
CAN WE JUST
DROP THIS, PLEASE?

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
NOW I'M WEAK
FROM HUNGER...

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:90%
VANDALISM, SHOPLIFTING,

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:90%
AND NOW THIS.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
IT SEEMS LIKE THE POLICE
ARE ALWAYS CHASING YOU.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
YOU LIKE TO RUN,
DON'T YOU, BRAD?

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:90%
I'VE DONE ENOUGH.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
FIRST ARREST,
OFFICER BURNS SAID

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
HE CHASED YOU ALL OVER TOWN
FOR 45 MINUTES.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle line:84%
YOU OUTRAN
THEIR FASTEST GUY.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I'M FAST.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
YOU EVER BEEN
ON THE TRACK TEAM, BRAD?

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:90%
I DON'T LIKE JOCKS.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:90%
HEY...

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
SAYS HERE
YOU GO TO MY SON'S SCHOOL.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:90%
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
YEAH.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
I'VE SEEN HIM AROUND.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:90%
HE'S, LIKE, BLIND, RIGHT?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:90%
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:90%
HMM.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:90%
HE'S ALSO A REALLY COOL KID.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW,
JUDGE MELANSON WARNED YOU

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:90%
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU EVER SHOWED UP
IN HIS COURTROOM AGAIN.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:90%
I THINK I...

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA
ABOUT HOW TO WORK THIS OUT.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:90%
YEAH?

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING TO RAT OUT ANYONE.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, GO AHEAD, SEND ME
TO RIDGEMONT, I DON'T CARE.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT, THIS
IS SOMETHING ELSE.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I'D HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER
AND YOUR ATTORNEY FIRST.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:90%
MY FATHER DOESN'T CARE, SO...

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:90%
I THINK HE DOES.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:84%
WHY ELSE WOULD HE
TAKE A DAY OFF FROM WORK

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:90%
TO SHOW UP HERE?

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:90%
MY FATHER'S HERE?

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
YEAH, DOWN IN THE COURTROOM
RIGHT NOW,

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
MAKING ALL
THE SECURITY GUARDS NERVOUS.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.400 align:middle line:84%
AND I'D HAVE TO TALK
TO THE JUDGE,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:84%
AND, HOPEFULLY, MELANSON'S
BACK ON HIS BRAN DIET.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:90%
BUT I THINK I CAN WORK IT OUT

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
SO YOU COULD STAY AT HOME
AND GO TO SCHOOL.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:90%
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%
ISN'T IT, BRAD?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
SO, MY DAD SAID
I COULD COME HOME?

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:90%
MM-HMM.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:90%
AND WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:90%
THE DEAL?

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:90%
HERE'S THE DEAL, BRAD.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
YOU KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN
FOR REAL THIS TIME

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:90%
AND YOU ANSWER

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:90%
ONE QUESTION,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:90%
CAN YOU, OR CAN YOU NOT, RUN?

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:90%
BRAD COLEMAN?

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
YOU'RE GETTING BRAD COLEMAN
TO RUN WITH ME?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
OH, I TAKE IT
YOU KNOW BRAD?

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.410 align:middle line:84%
UM, EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL
KNOWS BRAD.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
HE BEAT UP MS. McVIE.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
YOU WANT ME TO
GO OUT FOR A SCHOOL TEAM

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE GUY WHO BEAT UP
THE TRACK COACH?

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
TANYA McVIE?
SHE'S THE COACH?

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:90%
YEAH.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY
SHE WAS RUNNING TRACK,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I REMEMBER SEEING HER PICTURE
IN THE PAPER ALL THE TIME.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:90%
SO YOU'RE GETTING A THUG

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:90%
WHO ATTACKS TEACHERS,

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
YOUNG, SLIGHT,
VULNERABLE TEACHERS,

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
TO RUN WITH OUR SON,
OUR ONLY CHILD?

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:90%
WAIT, "SLIGHT?"

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
JULIE SAID MS. McVIE
WAS PLUMP AND HOMELY.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:90%
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:90%
YEAH, I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
HE DIDN'T BEAT HER UP,
HE PUSHED HER.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
THERE WAS A RUCKUS,
SHE FELL DOWN.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:90%
THE STAIRS.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:90%
I DON'T EVEN THINK

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
BRAD GOT SUSPENDED
THAT TIME.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:90%
THAT TIME?

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
AND I DON'T THINK MS. McVIE
WOULD EVEN REMEMBER IT.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:84%
HE ONCE GAVE HARLAN GLIEBERMAN
SUCH A BAD WEDGIE,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
THAT HE WALKED LIKE
A DUCK FOR TWO WEEKS.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
HARLAN GLIEBERMAN HAS
ALWAYS WALKED LIKE A DUCK.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:90%
SANDY...

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:90%
BRAD'S MESSED UP,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
BUT I THINK,
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:90%
FOR HIM TO FOCUS ON,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:84%
IT COULD REALLY HELP HIM
PULL IT TOGETHER.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:90%
ALEX, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT?

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
HOW BADLY DO YOU
WANT TO MAKE THIS TEAM?

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:84%
WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S ALL UP TO BRAD.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
DOES MS. McVIE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:90%
YEAH, SORT OF.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
SO, SHE KNOWS ABOUT ALEX
BUT NOT ABOUT ME?

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:90%
GREAT.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
MAN, THE LOOK ON HER FACE
IS GOING TO BE...

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:84%
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT?

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:90%
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:50.010 align:middle line:84%
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK
YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH ME?

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I CAN TRY MY BEST.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, LET'S GO.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:90%
[JULIE]: BRAD COLEMAN.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
THE WEDGIE KING
BRAD COLEMAN?

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.860 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S THE GUY.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:90%
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.650 align:middle line:90%
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:84%
WELL, NOT AS BAD
AS YOU'D THINK ANYWAY.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
OH, I'M SURE HE'S
A VERY BEAUTIFUL PERSON.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:84%
BUT I WENT TO
GRADE SCHOOL WITH HIM,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.120 align:middle line:84%
AND EVERY DAY
IN GRADE FIVE,

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:84%
HE STOLE MY MILK MONEY
FOR A MONTH.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:90%
HE DIDN'T.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I WAS SITTING ON THE SWINGS
MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS,

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:90%
AND HE COMES UP TO ME

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:84%
AND ASKS ME
IF I HAVE ANY MONEY.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:84%
WHAT, AND
YOU SAID YOU DID?

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I WASN'T THE HIP AND WORLDLY
CHICK THAT I AM TODAY.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
HE IS KIND OF CUTE.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:90%
BRAD?

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:90%
YEAH, HE'S GOT A NICE BUTT.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
LIKE AS NICE AS MINE, OR...?

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:84%
YOU'RE TOO SKINNY.
YOU DON'T HAVE A BUTT.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
PLEASE.
I'VE GOT BUNS OF STEEL.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.520 align:middle line:84%
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO EAT IT?

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:84%
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
MY MOM OR SOMETHING?

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:90%
ALEX...

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
LOOK, JULE, I KNOW
YOU'RE HER LITTLE SNITCH.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
ALL THOSE LITTLE
GIRL-TO-GIRL TALKS,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:90%
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.530 align:middle line:90%
RIGHT, THEY'RE ALL ABOUT YOU.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
OH, SO IT'S
A COINCIDENCE THEN

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE HAVE BEEN
IN EVERY CLASS TOGETHER

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:90%
SINCE GRADE ONE?

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:84%
LOOK, AT LEAST
MY GUIDE DOG

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:84%
WOULD EAT
MY LOUSY SANDWICH.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:90%
SO...

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:90%
THERE HE IS.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:90%
BRAD?

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
YEAH, AND HE'S WITH THAT
CRAZY VINCE BERNARD.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:90%
NOW HE'S LOOKING AT US.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, AND MAYBE
THEY WON'T COME OVER.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:90%
HEY.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:90%
WHO ARE THESE DORKS?

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
[WHISPERING]
WE'RE GOING TO DIE.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:90%
YOU READY FOR THIS AFTERNOON?

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:90%
YES, 2:00, RIGHT?

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:90%
YEAH.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:90%
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:90%
IT'S NOTHING.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:90%
COME ON, HE'S WAITING FOR US.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:90%
HEY...

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.200 align:middle line:90%
DON'T I KNOW YOU?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
NO.
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:90%
I JUST, I MOVED HERE FROM...

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:90%
BULGARIA.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:90%
YO, WE GOTTA GO.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:90%
[ALEX]: THAT WAS TENSE.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:90%
NICE BUTT.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:90%
HMM?

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, YEAH,
IT WAS TENSE.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT YOU SAID.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:90%
[GIGGLING]

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:84%
SO, SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN
WORRIED ABOUT SCHOOL?

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
HE'S BEEN ACTING
STRANGE ALL DAY.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I GOT SOMETHING THAT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:07.980 align:middle line:84%
IT'S A CHANCE TO EARN
SOME REALLY HEAVY CASH,

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:90%
AND IT'S EASY, TOO.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:90%
THERE'S THIS OLD LADY,

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
SHE LIVES
IN THE APARTMENT UP THERE.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:90%
SHE'S A REAL OLD BAG,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
BUT SHE COLLECTS
SOMETHING LIKE

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:84%
FIVE DIFFERENT
PENSION CHEQUES EVERY MONTH.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:90%
EVERY MONTH.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:84%
SO, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE DOES?

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
SHE CASHES THEM ALL
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN SHE WALKS HOME
WITH ALL THE CASH.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:90%
WITH ALL THE CASH.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:84%
SO SOMEBODY
WHO WAS QUICK,

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:84%
THEY COULD SNATCH
THAT PURSE,

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN THEY COULD
MAKE TRACKS

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
BEFORE THE GOLDEN GIRL
HAS ANY TIME TO YELL SWARM.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:90%
AM I RIGHT, BUDDY?

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:90%
YEAH, I GUESS.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:90%
IT'S PERFECT.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
THINK THIS ONE OVER.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
OKAY, JUST DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT TOO LONG.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
THE END OF THE MONTH
IS COMING UP PRETTY SOON.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:84%
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
GIVE ME A RIDE BACK TO SCHOOL,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:90%
AND I CAN THINK IT OVER.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:90%
NO, YOU CAN DAMN WELL WALK.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:90%
I NEED A RIDE BACK, MAN--

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
SO, HERE IS
THE CHANGING ROOM.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:90%
I KNOW, MS. McVIE.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I HAVE GYM CLASS
HERE EVERY DAY.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:84%
WHAT'S GOING ON,
COACH HOTTIE?

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:84%
TYSON, I AM NOT
GOING TO WARN YOU AGAIN

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT THAT TYPE
OF LANGUAGE.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.730 align:middle line:84%
ALEX HERE IS TRYING
OUT FOR THE TEAM.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES]
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I WANT YOU GUYS
TO TREAT ALEX RIGHT.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.650 align:middle line:84%
SOMEONE WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE RUNNING WITH YOU?

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:90%
YOU NEVER SAID WHO--

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:90%
HE'LL BE HERE.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.950 align:middle line:84%
ARE YOU SURE
YOU FEEL UP TO THIS?

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:90%
OKAY.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:90%
IS THIS A JOKE?

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
THIS AIN'T NO
SPECIAL OLYMPICS.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:90%
HEY, UH, TYSON,

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:90%
SHUT UP.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:90%
GOOD LUCK, MAN.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
THANKS.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:84%
SO, WHAT, IS THIS PART OF
THAT MAKE-A-WISH THING?

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
SPECIAL O,
WHERE'S YOUR PARTNER AT?

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.290 align:middle line:90%
KNOCK IT OFF, TYSON.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%
JUST JOKING AROUND, MITCH.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
JUST TRYING TO MAKE HIM
FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE BOYS.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:90%
YEAH, HE'S COMING.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
YEAH, IS IT ONE OF THOSE
EXCHANGE STUDENTS

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE RAGS ON HIS HEAD,
OR IS THAT--

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
IT MUST BE THAT BROOMSTICK
YOU HANG WITH?

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:90%
NOT EXACTLY.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:90%
HEY.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:90%
HEY, MAN.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
OH, THIS IS RICH.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:84%
SOMEONE HAVE TO BEAT ON YOU
TO GET YOU TO DO THIS?

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:90%
I THOUGHT, UH,

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I THOUGHT YOUR PEOPLE
COULD ONLY RUN

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.240 align:middle line:84%
FROM THE WELFARE OFFICE
TO THE LIQUOR STORE.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:90%
WELL, YOU'D JUST BETTER HOPE

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
THAT SOMEONE CAN RUN FAST ENOUGH
TO THE NURSE'S OFFICE

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:90%
TO STOP YOUR INTERNAL BLEEDING.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:84%
NOT AS FAST AS YOUR MOM
COULD RUN WHEN SHE SKIPPED TOWN.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:90%
COME ON, GUYS.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I'M NOT SCARED OF YOU, CHIEF.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.220 align:middle line:90%
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:84%
UNLIKE YOU,
I HAVE A REASON TO BE HERE.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
YOU GUYS ALMOST
READY IN THERE?

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:90%
UH, YEAH, WE'RE COOL.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:42.160 align:middle line:90%
YOU READY?

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:90%
YEAH.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.250 align:middle line:90%
HEY, COACH.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
BRADLEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I'M STRETCHING.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:84%
WE CAN'T HAVE
ANY TROUBLE HERE.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.700 align:middle line:84%
THESE BOYS HAVE WORKED
VERY HARD TO GET THIS FAR.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
THERE WON'T BE
ANY TROUBLE.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
WELL, YOU AND I HAVE
A HISTORY, COLEMAN,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.080 align:middle line:90%
AND IT ISN'T GOOD.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
YOU DON'T SEEM
TO APPRECIATE RULES.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT IT WAS YOU,
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.370 align:middle line:84%
STRINGS WERE PULLED
FOR ALEX, NOT FOR YOU,

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:90%
AND I CAN END THIS ALL

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:90%
AT ANY TIME.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:84%
JUST DON'T LET
YOUR FRIEND DOWN.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:90%
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:90%
YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS JUST--
IT WAS JUST A PRANK.

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:57.600 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS, LIKE, A TEAM THING.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
I DIDN'T UPLOAD IT
ON YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING--

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
YEAH, YOU
BETTER NOT HAVE,

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE THAT IS
A VERY SERIOUS LEGAL MATTER.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.100 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS NO PRANK.

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
WHAT YOU DID
WAS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL,

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SAY
MORE TO YOU,

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:09.820 align:middle line:90%

YEAH, BUT YOU WERE
BEING ABUSED.

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
THAT IS NOT THE POINT, BRAD.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.980 align:middle line:90%
SURE, I WAS HUMILIATED,

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%

GOING TO BE OKAY.

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.180 align:middle line:90%

TO BE PUNISHED.
