00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The true message of
"The Way of Miracles"

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is that my life and the lives
of the people that I work with

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:84%
represent a story that
underscores the point that

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.330 align:middle line:84%
people are more
powerful, more capable,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
of doing wonderful things
and making miracles than

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:90%
they're presently aware of.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.552 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha said, "as
we think so we become."

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
become a miracle maker,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.510 align:middle line:84%
you have to start thinking
about yourself differently.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.242 align:middle line:90%

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:10%
For the past 35 years, I've
seen 60,000 appointments.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:10%
I started in my practice
in 1982 with the notion

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:10%
that I was going to be
helping people lose weight.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking simple
basic nutrition 101.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Surprise, surprise,
people started

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
coming in right
away with problems

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:90%
that I felt really badly about.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.887 align:middle line:84%
I felt so much compassion for
so many of these people that

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:90%
needed help.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So I decided I was
going to give it a try.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
As far as I knew,
nutrition couldn't

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.390 align:middle line:84%
do half of what I ultimately
found out that it can do.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was a process of
discovery one person at a time.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.582 align:middle line:90%

00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So my name is Kate.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I was 29 years old,
when my husband

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and I decided that it
would be an ideal time

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.353 align:middle line:90%
to start our family.

00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
When it didn't
happen immediately,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
we sought help from doctors
and became increasingly more

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
heartbroken and frustrated that
we had not met with success.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
At such a young age,
I was told by doctors

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
that I had diminished
ovarian reserve.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I asked for a referral
and was connected

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
with a reproductive
endocrinologist.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
They discovered immediately
that I had a thyroid issue.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
That triggered something
to me immediately.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm 29.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.593 align:middle line:84%
I'm not able to get pregnant,
and I have thyroid issues.

00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Why is this?

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:84%
The next layer of
testing that I did

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
with the reproductive
endocrinologist

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:84%
revealed that I did
not have the ovarian

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
reserve that a typical
29 or 30-year-old had.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked
them about that,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I was told that it was
bad luck, that I had just

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:90%
drawn the short straw.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.985 align:middle line:84%
And that was the way
that it was going to be,

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and we could get over that
through IVF treatments.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But that was simply
the way that it was,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps that was
a genetic component.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I went through many failed
cycles at the first practice

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:90%
that I worked with.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I will never forget the day
that I wrote that my doctor said

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:90%
that I was an anomaly.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I looked across from her at
the table one day, and I said,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't I be pregnant by now?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%
And she said, absolutely.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
The average person
is pregnant by now.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:90%
That was crushing.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.545 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
that, I had started

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
seeing an acupuncturist,
because I was really

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.212 align:middle line:84%
looking for any avenue
of medicine that was

00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:39.503 align:middle line:90%
going to help me be successful.

00:02:39.503 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
That's how badly I
wanted this family.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed that
after my treatments,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.952 align:middle line:84%
I would get hives sometimes
where the needles were.

00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw her
again, she said,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I want you to try
going gluten free,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
because there is a link
between skin rashes and hives,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
in a gluten allergy.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Going gluten free, first of
all, it eliminated my hives.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
But second of all, my thyroid
function came back normal.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
That was when I was
like, I need to pursue

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
this avenue of my health a
little bit more seriously.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.305 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
connected with Mark.

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The first time I met Mark,
I joined him in his office,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and I filled out a questionnaire
about the food that I eat.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I told him why I was
there, and I was skeptical.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't give Mark
a lot of information.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I wanted him to
prove to me that he

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:90%
knew what he was talking about.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> To this day, I think the
most remarkable experience that

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I've ever had regarding
epiphanies is the epiphany

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
of my compassion leading
me to the idea of nonverbal

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.763 align:middle line:84%
Opening up an energy field
between my patients and myself,

00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that taught me
everything I needed

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:90%
to know about them and more.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> So he muscle tested me.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
He asked me a series
of random questions.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Are you cold?

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Which I knew was linked to my
thyroid, but I didn't tell him

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I had a thyroid issue.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.380 align:middle line:84%
He asked me if I
sometimes got viral sores.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he showed me
a diagram of my body

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.043 align:middle line:84%
and said that my fertility
issue was with my ovaries.

00:04:01.043 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't said
anything about that.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I told Mark I wanted to
have a baby and I couldn't.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't tell him that
the doctors had identified

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:90%
that I had low ovarian reserve.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So from muscle testing
me and asking me

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
three questions, that
indicated to me he

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.121 align:middle line:84%
knew exactly what
was going on, my jaw

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:90%
was practically on the floor.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.204 align:middle line:84%
>> There's so much going
on in a human being,

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
so much going on that's
nonverbal, and I'd feel that.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:90%
I'd sense that.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd perceive that at deeper
sensory levels in my own being.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I was learning things that I
didn't know I had access to.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But I opened up my
heart, instinctually,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and got back their answers
instinctually as well.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>> He told me that I had a
retrovirus that was wreaking

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:90%
havoc on my immune system.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
He told me in that very
moment what foods I could eat

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:90%
and what foods I had to avoid.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he put me on
a bunch of supplements.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
He told me, don't do any
treatments in the next three

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But give me six months,
and I guarantee you

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:90%
will be pregnant in six months.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So I went home and that day
cleaned out the cupboards,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:84%
bought all the supplements,
did my research.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I was nervous about taking
all those supplements.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But in the research
that I had done,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned that
Mark was putting me

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
on things that my body needed,
and should have been getting,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and just wasn't because
of modern day food

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and what we do to
the food that we eat.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So I checked back in with
Mark at the three month mark.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.995 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I think if you
start a treatment now and go

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:90%
about your treatment.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
After three months on that diet,
I had a completely different

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So prior to the diet and
the supplements with Mark,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I was producing
seven eggs that were

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
resulting in two embryos that
could be transferred back

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:90%
into me.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Three months later,
I produced 17 eggs

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that resulted in 10 viable
embryos to work with in order

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:90%
to achieve a pregnancy.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
My doctor walked
in the room too,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.235 align:middle line:84%
after those results
had come out.

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And he just looked at me,
and he said, who are you?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
what has happened.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It did happen, and it happened
right shy of the six month mark

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:90%
that Mark had promised.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that Mark would do,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.902 align:middle line:84%
when my husband and I
were meeting with him

00:06:02.902 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:84%
is, he would actually
call us mom and dad.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.607 align:middle line:84%
When you would leave
a meeting with him,

00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
you would say to
yourself, he believes

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:90%
this is going to happen to me.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And he keeps telling
me that I need

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.733 align:middle line:84%
to believe this is going
to happen for me as well.

00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was
transformational for us.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So there was the food, and
there were the supplements.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.257 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
also this piece

00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:84%
about just remaining
positive and believing

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:90%
that this would happen.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Probably the best visit
I've had with Mark

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.295 align:middle line:84%
was when I was able to bring
my daughter in and meet Mark.

00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And he looked over at her,
and she looked at him.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And she just let this
ginormous smile out for Mark,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and it was just one of those
really special moments for me.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And I think for Mark too.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, the baby that
people said wouldn't exist

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:90%
smiled back at me today.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.056 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:45.317 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Early on, when I
first started off,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to hear that so
many patients were having such

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:84%
a hard time with
Western medicine.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought to myself, that
doesn't sound like what

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
I was raised to understand.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And I expected this highly
technological advanced system

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:84%
of medicine to be
consistently errorless,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and to be efficient, and to
be capable, at least capable.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But for me, to find out
that so many people were

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
being mismanaged
and getting sicker

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.153 align:middle line:84%
was an astounding
reality for me.

00:07:15.153 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.277 align:middle line:84%
I thought to myself, well,
they have the technology.

00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:90%
They have the money.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.985 align:middle line:84%
They have the
slickness, if you will.

00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
of those things,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
but what I can make up for is
compassion, concern, interest.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.297 align:middle line:84%
When I work with
somebody, I'm just

00:07:29.297 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
positively determined to make
sure it's going to happen.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So I had patients that are
stacking me up with issues

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:90%
that I was unfamiliar with.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:90%
They were miles over my head.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't stop me.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
incredible things

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that I stumbled on with
whole systems medicine

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.337 align:middle line:90%
was this interconnectedness.

00:07:45.337 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
There all these
different energy zones

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.628 align:middle line:84%
in the body, different
acupuncture zones,

00:07:48.628 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:90%
meridians, if you will.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
ways to address

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:84%
the imbalances of
organ systems because

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of the interconnectedness
of energy.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Western world, we
tend to think of those things

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:90%
as all separate.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:90%
A kidney's a kidney.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.422 align:middle line:84%
A liver's a liver, but
they're all actually

00:08:02.422 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
part of one
electromagnetic family.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Within the context of
Ayurvedic medicine,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
food is one of the
major forms of medicine.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
These are 4,000
year old systems.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.303 align:middle line:84%
So they had 4,000 years
to work out the knots.

00:08:13.303 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
How can you not embrace
something that's

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:90%
been that well-experienced?

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energetic.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:90%
We're energetic.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.775 align:middle line:90%
All our foods are energetic.

00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
The reactions we have with
our foods are energetic.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a system of
energy here that says,

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
either the good things
are going to happen,

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.907 align:middle line:84%
or bad things are going
to happen with energy.

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So by eating a certain food,
it supports your energy system.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.894 align:middle line:84%
You're feeding your
wellness, your ease.

00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:90%
You're feeding your healthiness.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:10%
With negative foods,
you're actually

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:10%
feeding your disease,
your sickness.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
important to realize

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that virtually everything
we think, everything we eat,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.318 align:middle line:84%
everything we drink, every sip,
every bite, every encounter,

00:08:44.318 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
virtually everything
we do is energetically

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:84%
tied to this reality of
universal chi, life force.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:84%
This idea that life force
can be managed in order

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:84%
to make life better,
that's really

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.143 align:middle line:84%
the basis, the
foundation, of my work.

00:08:56.143 --> 00:08:58.458 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:58.458 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Adilio.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
About eight years ago, I was
diagnosed with Parkinson's.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:90%
My brother had it.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:84%
We saw his brother with
the symptoms that he had,

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed the
similarities in my husband.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Our neighbor has Parkinson's.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:84%
My former boss had Parkinson's,
all roughly a few years

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:90%
maybe before you.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But their symptoms were
a lot worse than yours.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you started
catching up to what

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:90%
they were going through.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Where I used to work, there
used to be a lot of walking.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I used to stumble over
my feet, sometimes fall.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:90%
So he put me on Sinemet pills.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
They helped a little
bit but not much.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We'd all be walking
along, a group of us,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'd turn around
like, where's my husband?

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:10%
And he'd be lagging behind.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:10%
I could see the effort in
him trying to reach us,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.070 align:middle line:10%
and he couldn't.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I'm like,
well, this is really not good.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And Doris, our close
friend, knew Mark

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:90%
from previous situations.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And she suggested we see him.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.973 align:middle line:84%
At first we were
like, we're still

00:09:54.973 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:90%
sticking with our physician.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:90%
He's got to do something right.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And it started just
getting worse and worse.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the swallowing
was the scariest part.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, swallowing,
I couldn't swallow.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When he would be eating, he
would always choke on his food.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And they kept saying, well,
we'll try something different.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:90%
We'll try something different.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And it just wasn't
working for you.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it wasn't.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> That too made me make
the decision to go see Mark.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I had my doubts, but--

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I says, it's getting worse.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%
What can I lose?

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Where your brother ended up,
you didn't want that to happen

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>> He did kinesiology on him and
told us exactly what he could

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and could not eat.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Got those little tube things
and tested me with stuff what I

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:90%
can eat on my arm.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:90%
I was like, who is this guy?

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I was like, this
ain't gonna work.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> He told him, 21 days, you
are going to see a difference.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:90%
We're both like, OK.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So he said, when
we left that day,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I am determined to go
and do what he said.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> When we got
out of the office,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
we went to get the
supplements right away.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And I went out, bought
the organics and all that he

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:90%
needed.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
He lost 30 pounds in those
21 days, and I'm like,

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:90%
you are a different person.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
His movements, everything,
just it was like,

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:90%
this is unbelievable.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So like they say,
you are what you eat.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.435 align:middle line:90%
It's like a miracle.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you have to be
careful about the concept

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:84%
of turning diseases into
a bunch of labels purely

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:84%
for the identification of a
protocol that has a matching

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:90%
pharmaceutical drug or two.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
On the case of Adilio,
viral inflammation

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
was causing the
symptoms that were

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
mimicking symptoms
of Parkinson's

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:90%
neurodegeneratively.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Symptoms of the language
of the body, the symptoms

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:90%
lead you to the source.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Listening to the symptoms
and not shutting them off,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, is
a much better idea.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When I go to my neurologists,
they can't believe how well

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I walk two to three
miles two times a week.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:90%
And it feels great.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Before, I couldn't do it,
because I used to stumble over

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:90%
my feet, sometimes fall.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.546 align:middle line:84%

a body with some symptoms
that need to be understood.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%

affect our health.

our endocrine system

for a migraine

00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:10%
would give them the
medication that would actually

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:10%
deaden the nerve endings.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.013 align:middle line:84%
So that you couldn't feel the

It's still there, but
you can't feel it.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
My way of dealing with that,
holistically, would be to say,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:84%
let's find out if it's the liver
that's causing the problem.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It could be a high concentration
of indoles, and phenols,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and different
chemistries in the liver

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that's causing
liver inflammation.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It's sending this message
to the body, to the head,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
in the form of pain
called a headache.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a food
allergy or a food sensitivity

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to wheat, to dairy, to any one
of a number of possibilities.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
To me, the most
important facet is

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
to understand the dynamics,
the physics, if you will,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of the disease to get
to the root of what's

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
causing the pain, the
suffering, and to be

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
able to work systemically within
the context of imbalances that

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:90%
are existing in those systems.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:84%

shut the pain off.

their home life,

at the beach.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%

and was subsequently diagnosed

with autoimmune

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.962 align:middle line:90%

And after a period of
time, it seemed to work.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And then about, I'd say,
four or five years later,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.515 align:middle line:84%
the hearing loss
came back again.

00:15:44.515 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I again was prescribed
steroids, but this time it

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
wasn't working quite as

hey, what's going on here?

How long is this
supposed to take

till I get my hearing back?

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And the response I got was,
well, it's not coming back.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It might not come back.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
It might actually get worse,
and the goal of this treatment

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is to help stabilize
where you are

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and try to keep it from getting
worse as much as possible.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to cure you.

We actually don't
know, but we have

a limited number of options

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:90%
to try.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
The only way we know if any of
this works is if you tell us.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking to
myself, wait a minute.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you driving the bus?

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
The message was to
learn to live with it

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:90%
and manage it, hearing aids.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%
They talked to me about
doing a cochlear implant.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And I actually got hearing aids.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Even with the hearing aids,
hearing was still not great.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I was still having
difficulty in conversations

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:90%
talking to people.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:84%
If I'm having a meeting, talking
with someone in a business

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.645 align:middle line:84%
setting, sitting
across the table,

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't understand them.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:52.645 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't hear them.

00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:90%
It was not manageable.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And so I said to the doctor--

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.897 align:middle line:84%
I call him up, said,
look, this isn't working,

00:16:58.897 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and we got to do something else.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I tried managing it.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, sorry,
there is nothing else.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just realized that
it's time to change course.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:84%
You're not driving
the bus anymore.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Give me the keys.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my first
encounter happened with Mark.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
As chance happened, Mark
moved into my building.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was just two
offices down from me.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I had heard about
him from a number

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
of sources, people telling
me their experience,

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
personal experience.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
In that first meeting,
we spent about an hour,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
did his readings, energy
readings, muscle testing.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
He asked me questions,
interviewed me.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I'm sitting
there with hearing aids

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and listening as
best that I can.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he says to me
at the end of the hour,

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:90%
here's the problem.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Your adrenal glands and your
spleen, I think, it was.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.975 align:middle line:90%
That's the root of your problem.

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Here's how we're
going to fix it,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and he prescribed a diet
and certain supplements,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.552 align:middle line:90%
homeopathic approaches.

00:17:52.552 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:90%
And he said, all right.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, listen, you
can't eat X, Y, and Z.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it's easier to
think of what I could eat,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of things
were crossed off.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And he says, if
you do this, here's

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.870 align:middle line:90%
how long it's going to take.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Here's the result
you can expect.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you come
back here, you're

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.480 align:middle line:84%
not going to be around
those hearing aids.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow, OK.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out of that
office thinking to myself,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:90%

body.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:10%
They filter germs, bacteria,
viruses, allergens, endotoxins,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.533 align:middle line:10%
constantly filtering these
poisons out of the body.

00:18:31.533 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:90%
You want them to flow.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.367 align:middle line:90%
You want them to move.

00:18:33.367 --> 00:18:36.053 align:middle line:84%
Back to the idea of
flow, if they back up,

00:18:36.053 --> 00:18:38.345 align:middle line:84%
things get problematic in
the head, and the eyes, ears,

nose, and throat, et cetera.

00:18:39.513 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
happened to Michael.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.805 align:middle line:84%
His hearing is backed up because
of the fact that his lymphatic

00:18:43.805 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
was swollen with a lot of debris
that wasn't being filtered,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:90%
because his spleen was weak.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Through an exposure
to environmental mold,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
the mold had entered my
body and become fungal.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So what he was doing
was cleaning that up.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:84%
It was an adjustment
to the diet,

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:90%
but it was very impactful.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Hearing started
improving I would

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
say within a couple
of weeks probably.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, then after three
months, it was--

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I had actually got rid
of the hearing aids.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't need them.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
As a result of following
Mark's protocol,

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
I now have 90% to 100%
of my hearing back.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.787 align:middle line:90%
It is a maintenance as well.

00:19:17.787 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not the quick
pill that we're all

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:84%
programmed to say, oh,
you're one and done.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's easier.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier
than you think.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:90%
It's actually very empowering.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple question.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to slave
to your palate,

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
or do you want to be a
master of your health?

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
would choose the latter.

predicated on the science

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:10%
of Isaac Newton's physics

machine theory of life.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:10%
The heart's a pump.

The eyes are like a camera.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
They're mechanisms and machines,
but the mind's got nothing

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:90%
to do with any of this.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, according to the
mechanistic theory of life,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
the mind doesn't
do anything at all.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't really
influence the brain,

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because that's impossible
in a mechanistic world view.

of mind and matter,

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:10%
it's two different things,

The hand can only lift if
the hand, and the intention,

So what does that mean?

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It basically means that
we have been fed a belief

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
system that we are separate,
and that we are only physical,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and that consciousness arises
from physical processes

Western medicine

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
as it's currently

>> What does the
word physical mean?

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Well, it comes to
the word physis

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:10%
which is a Greek word
which means nature.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at the time of Newton
they called scientists, what

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.715 align:middle line:84%
they call today
scientists, they called

00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:90%
them natural philosophers.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So physics is
really about nature.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Today though, it has degenerated
into something that says,

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:90%
well, it's material.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It's something that's concrete.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
I can touch, et cetera.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And we know from physics that
actually the touch that we have

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:84%
or filling the boundary
is an illusion,

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.605 align:middle line:84%

just electromagnetic forces.

to be the smallest particle

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
in the universe when
physics was being created,

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.367 align:middle line:84%
turns out that
they looked inside.

00:22:21.367 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And they found there
were smaller particles.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.492 align:middle line:84%
There are electrons,
protons, and neutrons.

00:22:25.492 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So there are smaller
physical things.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But then the revolution
came in and say,

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
what are those small
things made out of?

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:84%
What's an electron or
proton made out of?

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:10%
And then they come down in
some kind of metaphysical world

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:10%
like quarks.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And I go, what does
all this represent?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It turns out there is
no physical structure

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
inside the so-called
particles that create an atom.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
The atom is an
illusion of matter.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy vortex.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all like a nano tornado.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%

E equals mc squared,

about the theory of relativity.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Energy and matter are
interconvertible and

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.312 align:middle line:90%
transferable.

00:23:04.312 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we understand E is
equaled to mc squared.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, on one
side you have E, energy.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
On the other side,
you have M, matter.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein said,
matter and energy

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.418 align:middle line:90%
are equivalent to each other.

00:23:16.418 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to call
it matter, or are you

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.960 align:middle line:90%
going to call it energy?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So maybe a better term
is mass-energy, one word

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:90%
rather than mass and energy.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1931, Werner Heisenberg
won the Nobel Prize

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
for teaching us that energy
makes up 99.999% of reality.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We have our five sensory
connection, our three

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%
dimensional tendencies.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're only able
to see, and perceive,

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and connect with, and
communicate about,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.755 align:middle line:84%
and understand what we
see, and what we can touch,

00:23:47.755 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:90%
and what we can feel.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:90%
We don't go beyond that.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So in modern
quantum field theory,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
the only reality is
vibrations of energy.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Those vibrations of
energy are called quanta.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They're called particles,
condensed forms of energy.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Matter itself is made
up of fields and energy.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Energy is what makes things
move, act, have activity.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And fields are what
give shape or form

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to the way the
energy is organized.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we take
a step further,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
it starts to clarify a much
bigger picture that we are

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:19.830 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic beings.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:84%
We're energy beings, that
everything is energy.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Diseases are energy.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Viruses are energy.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Bacterias are energy.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:90%
There is a process.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There is a dance that takes
place between our energy

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and the energies around
us and within us.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:84%
When we lower our frequency,
our energy, our verve, our life

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
force, we run the
risk of lowering

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
our electromagnetic frequency
into a range that harmonizes

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
with viruses that are
capable of affecting

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:90%
our neurological beingness.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Albert Einstein's very
famous quote comes right here.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:84%
"The field is the sole governing
agency of the particle."

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Energy is the sole
governing agency of matter.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Energy is the force
that shapes matter.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
We've excluded energy
from all the sciences,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:90%
because they were Newtonian.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean Newtonian
science is wrong.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just a small
subset of a bigger

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:90%
science called quantum physics.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics
is the energy universe

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that a
number of healers say,

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:84%
regardless of their
healing tradition,

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
is they talk about information
that is stored both within

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the body and
outside of the body.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:84%
The biofield is a set
of interpenetrating

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and interacting fields
of energy and information

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:90%
that guide our health.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have kinesiologists
and energy healers

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.550 align:middle line:84%
talking about how they
can get information

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:84%
about a person's
history, their memory,

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
even their emotional state
from informational fields

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:90%
around the body.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the
definition of field?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:90%
In physics, a simple definition?

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Invisible moving forces that
influence the physical world.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, this is amazing,
because ancient word spirit is

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
invisible moving forces that
influence the physical world.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is
giving us the insight

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that spiritualists
have always talked

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:84%
about without a
scientific foundation.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
science of energy.

>> My name is Elizabeth.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I had breast cancer in 1996.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I went off on vacation,
found something hard,

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and basically, was
filled with dread

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:84%
immediately from my first
encounter with that lump.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Within a couple of
weeks, got the diagnosis,

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:90%
yes, you have breast cancer.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:84%
There had to be
chemo for six months

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:90%
and radiation for three months.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Then I first had a lumpectomy.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And after the lumpectomy, in
my heart, I felt that I was--

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:90%
it was gone.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I felt like that's
where I should end,

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:90%
but I was very fearful.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I had two young girls,
kindergarten, second grade.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So I began the
chemo, dreading it,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
feeling like it was just the
wrong, wrong thing to do.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.510 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the six months,
I was physically a wreck.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:90%
It really took a toll on me.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I felt so unwell in every
way I can possibly describe.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:90%
And I had no energy.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:90%
I was nauseous.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I felt weak.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Eyelashes, eyebrows
gone, hair, just

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to see the impact all
over my body physically

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:84%
but inside of me,
I just felt like I

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:90%
was a walking dead person.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I had the life sucked out of me.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I tried to stay on track
in my life for my girls.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So I would go in and help in the
classroom as much as I could.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But I just remember sitting
in those little chairs

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:84%
in the kindergarten
room and trying

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:84%
to do something with a child
and just like, oh my God.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Just trying to get through
the process and be up for them

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:90%
and be myself, but it was hard.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:90%
It was hard.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:84%
When the six months were up,
my daughter in kindergarten

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
had a friend over
for a playdate.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the very first
time they played together.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know her.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know the mom.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.420 align:middle line:84%
But when her mom
came to pick her up,

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and she pulled out
an appointment card

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:90%
and handed it to me.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this
man can help you.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I have an appointment
with him next week,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.450 align:middle line:90%
but I cannot make it.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
to try to see him,

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
it would be months
down the road.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.490 align:middle line:90%
He has a long waiting list.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:90%
So here.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Take this.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Go see this man next week.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea who it was,
why I was going, but I went.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I just felt it was
a strong message.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.090 align:middle line:90%
I needed to pursue this.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to that
appointment, my very first time

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:84%
meeting Mark, I can't even
describe how different

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that appointment was from any
doctor's appointment I'd ever

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:90%
experienced before.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It was just a whole
different world

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:04.080 align:middle line:84%
of talking about health,
your body, disease, energy,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:90%
your spirit.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:84%
He just wove everything
together versus just talking

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:84%
about your body and what drugs
we're going to put you on next.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a more meaningful
experience that's taking place

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.330 align:middle line:84%
just based on the talk, just
based on the conversation.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So the minute you
come in, you're

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
feeling that you're
being addressed

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
at a deeper level in
ways that you don't even

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.260 align:middle line:90%
address yourself, perhaps.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> He taught me things that I
just had no idea were a part

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:90%
of wellness, like your pH.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It's often too acidic,
and that's the environment

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:90%
in which cancer cells thrive.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And disease in
general, cancer included,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:90%
is an obligate anaerobe.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:84%
That means it doesn't like
oxygen. Disease can't live when

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
there's oxygen. But
by the same token,

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
sickness manifests quite readily
where there's not an alkalinity

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and not a lot of oxygen. Sugar
produces a very strong acidosis

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.740 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been a sugarholic
since I was a child.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:90%
So that just made so much sense.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:90%
He sent off a hair analysis.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And that yielded a
lot of information

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
about what was going on
in my body in that moment

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and what we needed to do to
bring ratios back into balance.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that appointment, I
just learned so very much.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
of my feeling empowered,

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:84%
like I have a role
in being well here.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So we worked on my diet, worked
through supplements and food

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:84%
to get me healthy again, make
me feel like myself again.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I trusted
everything he said.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:90%
I took everything he said.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
weeks' time, our family

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:84%
was going off on a ski weekend
with another family, our best

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:90%
friends.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I was going with
them, but I was just

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.360 align:middle line:84%
going to be staying in the
lodge not skiing, obviously.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I had no strength,
or energy, or the wherewithal

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.110 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in my body to do that.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But when we got there,
the first morning,

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:90%
everyone was going off to ski.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it's
gorgeous out there.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:90%
I actually feel pretty good.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll try this.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So I got some skis, went
out on the Bunny Slope,

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:90%
and I just took off.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.665 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I said, I've got to go.

00:31:11.665 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:90%
I've got to try this.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I think I can do it, and I did.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And I literally was going
down this hill singing

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and crying, which
I'm going to do now,

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.772 align:middle line:84%
just filled with joy
because I was back.

00:31:29.772 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I was back.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It took a few weeks.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
That's all it took.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Eating properly,
eating the right foods,

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:84%
taking the supplements,
that brought me back to life

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.430 align:middle line:90%
in no time.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:90%
It felt like a true miracle.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:90%
It truly did.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.640 align:middle line:84%
already know about
and that we measure.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we can
place electrodes in our head

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.630 align:middle line:90%
or on our heart.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And we get these
electromagnetic readouts.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.060 align:middle line:84%
From EKG and EEG,
and those tell us

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
about our clinical
condition, our heart health,

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and our brain.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So those are aspects
of the biofield.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:84%
We can even study the
biofield of cells.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:84%
We can look at electromagnetic
readouts of the cells.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can look and see how
using electromagnetic energies

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.718 align:middle line:90%
affect cellular health.

00:32:45.718 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty
well-known and studied,

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's really a booming
area in regenerative medicine,

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.050 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:10%
>> When we put electrodes
across the body,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.075 align:middle line:10%
which is done in hundreds of
thousands of times every day

00:32:55.075 --> 00:32:57.610 align:middle line:10%
in doctors' offices, you're
measuring current flow.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we
have a current flow,

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:90%
you create a magnetic field.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Every time the
heart beats, it also

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:84%
produces an
electromagnetic field.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.210 align:middle line:84%
The heart's the largest source
of rhythmic electrical energy

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So the heart's
magnetic field can

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:84%
be measured with
today's equipment

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.037 align:middle line:84%
about three feet from the
body, where we've actually

00:33:13.037 --> 00:33:15.400 align:middle line:84%
proven and published now
in peer review journals

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that the magnetic
field of the heart

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is carrying emotional
information.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:10%
We currently have
about 75% accuracy

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.630 align:middle line:10%
knowing what the
person's feeling,

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:10%
whether they're
conscious of it or not.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:10%
>> We are energy beings.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:10%
And the biofield is the
energy field of our bodies.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's an organizing field.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all of the
chemistry and physiology

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:84%
of the body is controlled
ultimately by the biofield.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But still, the
consciousness or the mind

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:90%
is the master of the biofield.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And the biofield
we see as a bridge

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.280 align:middle line:90%
between the mind and the body.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Your energy field
has the consciousness.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:90%
It thinks.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:52.840 align:middle line:90%
It feels.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.850 align:middle line:90%
It's part of your living force.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:84%
We're designed to react
energetically to everything.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It's part of our
neuromuscular defense system.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:10%
So again, if you're
sitting at home relaxing

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:10%
and you hear a shot go
off in the neighborhood,

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:10%
you're going to jump.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.199 align:middle line:84%
That's part of your
neuromuscular defense

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:90%
system trying to protect you.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are designed
to react not just

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:84%
to those circumstances in
those fashions but everything.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.715 align:middle line:84%
If I have you raise up your
arm, and I calibrate you,

00:34:18.715 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and I say, look, if you
hear negative images,

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.719 align:middle line:84%
negative thoughts, your
arm is going to be weak.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.020 align:middle line:84%
If I give you positive
images, love, happiness,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.340 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get strong.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:31.360 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, we can actually
call out foods, wheat, dairy,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and get you to
react and respond.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.420 align:middle line:90%
You line up 100 people.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.469 align:middle line:84%
They're going have
different positives

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and different negatives.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty of
everybody's energy field,

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:40.989 align:middle line:84%
because you are a conscious,
living, dynamic awareness.

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.838 align:middle line:84%
You and I are fields
of living awareness.

00:34:43.838 --> 00:34:45.880 align:middle line:84%
We're tapping into that
field of living awareness

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:90%
with intention.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.168 align:middle line:84%
That's how we find out what's
going on with the body.

00:34:49.168 --> 00:34:51.483 align:middle line:84%
We tap in energetically,
find out what kind of systems

00:34:51.483 --> 00:34:53.650 align:middle line:84%
are breaking down, and how
we can build them back up

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:90%
and balance them.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:84%
If somebody gets a migraine
headache or a stomachache,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.360 align:middle line:84%
they're not thinking
about energy.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking about
their physical properties.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:90%
My head hurts.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Your head, to you, is something
material and physical.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But I challenge people to think
that when you get into the why,

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:90%
why does your head hurt?

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:90%
You start to move into energy.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So your headache might happen,
because you ate a food that's

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.170 align:middle line:90%
causing an inflammation.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the
transference of energy.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So again, 72% of all
disease is inflammatory,

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
but 99.99% of all
activity is energetic.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is happening
at an energetic level.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.362 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Elena.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, I started
getting headaches.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.820 align:middle line:90%
My vision started getting worse.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.870 align:middle line:90%
And I went to see a doctor.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
After the MRI, she said,
well, there is bad news.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:84%
You have meningioma, a brain
tumor the size of walnut

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.790 align:middle line:90%
in your head.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And after I went to see
a specialist, he said,

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing we can
do besides surgery.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:90%
There's two types of surgery.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:90%
One, they go through your nose.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And the other one,
they open your skull.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And since my tumor
was too big, they

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:84%
couldn't remove
it from the nose.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.800 align:middle line:90%
They had to open my skull.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:90%
The surgery was done.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:90%
They think it was perfect.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:84%
My vision came back after I
was totally completely blind

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.800 align:middle line:90%
and I started seeing again.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.160 align:middle line:90%
I was very happy.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I was very happy for a year.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And about a year and then my
symptoms start coming back.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I went to see a doctor
again, and he did MRI.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
there is bad news.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Tumor come back
most of the time.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And it started growing again.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I ask, why?

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.750 align:middle line:90%
What is the reason?

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Why is it coming back?

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Why is it growing again?

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And he said, nobody knows.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And at that point, I said, no.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not coming back.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not growing.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going through
a second surgery again.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And I start looking
for some other ways.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine recommended
me to see Dr. Mincolla.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I was
ready for anything just not

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:90%
to go through surgery again.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.090 align:middle line:84%
My first appointment
with Dr. Mincolla

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.190 align:middle line:90%
was surprising for me, actually.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:84%
He put his finger
over right here

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and then started pushing my
hand down and asking questions

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:90%
like, wheat?

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Sugar?

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Dairy?

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And every time my
hand fell down,

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:84%
it meant that I can't
eat particular food.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.120 align:middle line:84%
In order to avoid surgery,
I need to change my diet

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and go strictly with everything
that Dr. Mincolla told me.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I would have to
come every month,

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:84%
so he can adjust my diet
through muscle testing

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and change some supplements.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have a genetic
map when we're conceived.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's mutations on
our genetic maps, potentials

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and possibilities for disease
that can manifest in accordance

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:90%
with our hereditary patterning.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.102 align:middle line:10%
But these can't
express unless there

00:38:04.102 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:10%
is something to trigger them.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:10%
Things like sugar and
allergies, like wheat allergies,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle line:10%
end up driving up the
arachidonic acid levels, which

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:10%
drive up the leukotrienes,
and the Cox-2 Hormones.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Many diseases follow this
pathway of inflammation.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> My headaches
started disappearing,

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and I started feeling better.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything came back
to a normal life.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And after about
two years, I went

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:90%
to see my doctor to do MRI.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
He did MRI, and he said, listen,
I don't know what you're doing

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:90%
but keep doing it.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Your tumor is shrinking.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It looks great, and he got
very excited with my results.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I've been tumor-free
for nine years now,

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.450 align:middle line:90%
and I keep following diet.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, I cheat a little bit.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But in general, I follow Dr.
Mincolla's recommendations.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.180 align:middle line:90%
The diet works.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Supplements, I think, this is
a miracle, the food, energy.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible to know
that with changing diet,

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:09.480 align:middle line:84%
you can shrink tumor
and feel great again.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.826 align:middle line:90%

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming from a physical point
of view, which is physics,

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of course, quantum physics,
we quickly get to the point

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:90%
of what is the mind?

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And how does the mind
interact with matter,

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.960 align:middle line:90%
what is called matter?

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
nature of reality?

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So these are deep questions, but
they really comes down to what,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.040 align:middle line:84%
in fact, any human
being experiences,

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:90%
which is our own mind.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:41.332 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
health, a lot of times,

00:39:41.332 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
the West, we really

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
mean health of
the physical body.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:49.240 align:middle line:84%
However, as the ancient
Greeks first said,

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.900 align:middle line:84%
you can't have a healthy
body without a healthy mind.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There's two little words,
internal and external.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.350 align:middle line:84%
When somebody has a bunch
of problems like headaches,

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:00.970 align:middle line:84%
rheumatoid arthritis,
stomachaches,

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.950 align:middle line:84%
whatever the case
may be, we want

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to know if the lion's
share of those problems,

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.930 align:middle line:84%
if most of those problems
are being caused by something

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:90%
internal or external.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Internal is spirit,
emotion, thought.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.455 align:middle line:10%
External is cells,
tissues, organs, the body.

00:40:17.455 --> 00:40:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So we want to make sure we
have a distinction here.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.760 align:middle line:84%
We know the difference
between the internal self

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and the external self.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Our culture has programmed
us to think of ourselves

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and associate and identify with
ourselves from the perspective

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:90%
of physiological.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.073 align:middle line:84%
The idea of external, as I
would call it, it's cellular.

00:40:35.073 --> 00:40:37.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't spend a whole lot
of time going internally,

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.950 align:middle line:84%
the relating to
the concept of self

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
from an internal perspective.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
emotional IQ or emotions.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
spirit very well.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand so many very
powerful, powerful, components

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:84%
of self that have a great deal
to do with disease and healing.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key messages
of "The Way of Miracles"

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:58.000 align:middle line:84%
is that people have a very
powerful internal self.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:84%
People have a very
powerful spirit.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.208 align:middle line:84%
People have very
powerful emotional self,

00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.010 align:middle line:90%
a very powerful mental self.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:84%
These unseen invisible
extra sensory components

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:11.020 align:middle line:84%
of self that exist beyond the
parameters of the five senses

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.200 align:middle line:84%
are the missing link
to human greatness.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:17.850 align:middle line:90%


00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's two types of
medicine, prevention,

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.710 align:middle line:90%
intervention.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:26.550 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to acute
disease, trauma, accidents,

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
interventive medicine
is essential.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.270 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
chronic disease,

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:33.420 align:middle line:84%
chronic ailments, the expression
of genetic weaknesses,

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, that's where
holistic medicine shines.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Every disease has a causal
route, every disease.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is going
to push the buttons.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Stress and tension's
going to push the buttons.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Trauma is going to
push the buttons.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.540 align:middle line:10%
Any of those
circumstances, they're

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.868 align:middle line:10%
capable of triggering a lot
of those genetic realities.

00:41:50.868 --> 00:41:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people have been
programmed with a belief about

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:53.940 align:middle line:90%
genetics.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.773 align:middle line:84%
And in that science,
we talk about something

00:41:55.773 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:84%
called genetic control,
that the genes control

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.660 align:middle line:90%
our physical traits.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But then we also went
on to say that genes

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.350 align:middle line:84%
control our behaviors
and emotions as well.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to
an understanding

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.155 align:middle line:84%
that we are victims
of our heredity.

00:42:09.155 --> 00:42:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is running
in my family,

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I can anticipate that I shall
likely express that as well.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, there's
a revolution.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Scientific Revolution
is based on a science called

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:90%
epigenetics.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.140 align:middle line:90%
"Epi" means above.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.430 align:middle line:90%
And I say, what's the above?

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, the environment.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a
sudden, I say, yes,

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:30.810 align:middle line:84%
but between the environment
and ourselves is a mind.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the mind not just
reads the environment,

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:84%
but it also provides
an interpretation

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of that environment based on
our programming and learning

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.720 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics can change
the readout of the genes

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:84%
based on the signals
from the environment.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I can create over 3,000
different protein molecules

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:52.470 align:middle line:84%
from the same blueprint based on
epigenetic control mechanisms.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Since it's based on the
environment and our perception

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of the environment, those are
things that we can control.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Genetics gave us the belief
we were victims of heredity.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And epigenetics turns the
table, because epigenetics says,

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.050 align:middle line:84%
we are masters of
our genetic control.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we can control
our perceptions,

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and we can control
our environment.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> About 50 years ago, the
field of psychoneuroimmunology

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.900 align:middle line:90%
didn't even exist.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Because in Western
science, we didn't even

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.860 align:middle line:84%
believe that our
mind and our emotions

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.480 align:middle line:84%
could affect our
physical health.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But that has changed
dramatically.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And over the last
50 years, we've

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.060 align:middle line:84%
not only learned
that the brain is

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:84%
connected to the immune system
and the hormonal system.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But our emotions
affect us deeply.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> More often than not, the
root of disease is energetic.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's emotional imbalances
that cause physical sickness.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It's grief.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:90%
It's anxiety.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It's unresolved.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.900 align:middle line:10%
So emotion that's
unresolved puts us

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.030 align:middle line:10%
in a stressed
chemistry state that

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:10%
triggers the psychosomatic
response bridging

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:10%
from immaterial to material.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.470 align:middle line:84%
The mind and the
body are one thing.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.180 align:middle line:90%
They're one field of energy.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's more chemistry
that's produced in your brain

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.920 align:middle line:84%
than there is in the
downtown pharmacy.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:84%
As we think, so
does our body go.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The nervous
system is perception,

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:90%
reading the environment.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But the mind is
an interpretation

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:90%
of the perception.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:84%
When the brain interprets
through the mind

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
stress, it's usually

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.710 align:middle line:84%
time to engage what is
called fight or flight.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.895 align:middle line:90%
I got to get out of here.

00:44:20.895 --> 00:44:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I've got to save my
life, or I got to engage.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I got to do something.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I say, that engagement
involves arms and legs.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.880 align:middle line:84%
When we're at rest and
at peace, the blood flow

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is principally into the viscera
and into the head, where

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:84%
we nourish the organs
that keep us healthy,

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.210 align:middle line:84%
maintain our bodies,
and just watchdog of how

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.650 align:middle line:90%
the system is working.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Stress hormones cause
the blood vessels

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.400 align:middle line:90%
in the gut to squeeze shut.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.050 align:middle line:84%
That pushes the
blood to the outside.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So it shuts off
maintenance of the body.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.598 align:middle line:84%
The immune system is one of
the most energy using systems

00:44:51.598 --> 00:44:52.890 align:middle line:90%
in the body, when it's working.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Stress hormones shut
down the immune system

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:90%
to conserve energy.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So we can use that energy
for fight or flight

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.010 align:middle line:90%
from the exterior threat.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the last one,
which I always call insult

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.450 align:middle line:84%
to injury, because
the blood vessels

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:10.020 align:middle line:84%
in the forebrain conscious
area squeeze shut.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.210 align:middle line:84%
That pushes the blood
to the hindbrain

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.450 align:middle line:84%
which is reaction, reflex,
no thinking, response.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.632 align:middle line:10%
And so the three effects
of the stress hormone

00:45:18.632 --> 00:45:20.340 align:middle line:10%
shutting down the
growth the maintenance,

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.090 align:middle line:10%
shutting down the immune system,
and it shuts down intelligence.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Because thinking is too slow
in an emergency response.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.980 align:middle line:84%
In today's world,
stress is 24/7, 365.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.530 align:middle line:84%
We were never
physiologically designed

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to have that
interference with growth

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system
and intelligence

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.940 align:middle line:90%
for long periods of time.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.300 align:middle line:10%
So now, it turns out
up to 90% of illness

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:10%

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.900 align:middle line:84%
there's a soul that's observing
silently all of our life

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We touch upon it
from time to time.

We get closer and
then further away.

The challenge is
to lock into it,

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:84%
to identify with it as
source, as true self.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a conscious mind
that processes 2,000

entirely different.

It's referred to spiritually
as the Atman or the Brahman.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.730 align:middle line:90%
It's higher thought.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:90%
It's elevated thought.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the limitless thought.

To attain that
higher consciousness

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is, ironically, a matter of
doing less not doing more.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.710 align:middle line:84%
We can develop and become
aware of super consciousness

00:46:56.710 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:84%
through a lot of meditation,
prayer, going within ourselves,

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.880 align:middle line:84%
operating at a deeper level

Stress can be dealt with in
a variety of different ways.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
ways is deep meditation.

prayer, yoga, dance,

there are a number
of different ways.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But really, the key is simply
to drop into an awareness

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:25.990 align:middle line:90%
of the subtle.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:28.570 align:middle line:84%
In every moment,
letting our minds quiet

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and really allowing ourselves
to feel deeply in our bodies.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You start to quiet the
mind through meditation.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:84%
You move into the meditative
state which is alpha.

And things start to slow down.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.742 align:middle line:84%
When things slow down,
possibilities open up.

00:47:45.742 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You start to move
closer and closer

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.240 align:middle line:84%
in the super conscious
realm by calming

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:84%
our nervous system
at a deep, deep level

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.290 align:middle line:90%
by cultivating peace.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Cultivating peace means you
don't embrace negativity.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't get stuck on it.

00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.128 align:middle line:90%
You move past it.

00:47:59.128 --> 00:48:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of whether
you're controlling your mind

I, basically, just grew
up a really sick kid.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I was in and out of Children's
Hospital multiple times

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.920 align:middle line:84%
per week for periods
of time growing up,

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.430 align:middle line:84%
always had a cold, or some
sort of virus, or a flu,

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.100 align:middle line:90%
or scarlet fever, or mono.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I had prediabetes or was
prediabetic, hypoglycemic.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was 18, I was
a freshman in college.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:33.960 align:middle line:10%
I woke up one morning
with debilitating pain,

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.550 align:middle line:10%
like truly debilitating.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I went to the ER
then and, eventually,

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:84%
after lots of tests, found
out that I had pancreatitis.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Doctors were not
sure why at first.

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:46.800 align:middle line:84%
They did more tests and
tried to figure it out.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they found out
that I had an atypical form

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:50.820 align:middle line:90%
of cystic fibrosis.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I just read a lot of stuff
about typical cystic fibrosis

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and how life expectancy can be
very young, mid-30s, younger.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:84%
That was just, I would say,
a tough time in general

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:84%
starting to think about
these things so young

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and wondering what was going
to happen in the future.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Another doctor that was really
significant during this time

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.688 align:middle line:90%
was my GI.

00:49:12.688 --> 00:49:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of the
first questions I asked him

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:16.410 align:middle line:90%
after I got diagnosed.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Will I still be able
to study abroad?

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Is this still possible?

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was all excited,
and he paused.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he
looked down at me,

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and he was like, we'll try our
hardest to get you over there.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.490 align:middle line:90%
I just realized this is serious.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.340 align:middle line:84%
My mom made an
appointment for me

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.920 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Mincolla who was
recommended to her by a family

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.720 align:middle line:90%
friend of ours.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.200 align:middle line:84%
My mom and I came prepared
with my massive file.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being like, do
you want to see my blood work?

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, no, I
don't need any of that.

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth was a little bit of
two different issues converged.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Her pancreatitis, of course, had
a lot to do with carbohydrates,

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:56.110 align:middle line:84%
starches, sugars,
processed foods.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that her
atypical cystic fibrosis

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:02.250 align:middle line:84%
is more correlated with a lot of
the stress that she was under,

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as her diet,
which had to be

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:06.300 align:middle line:84%
largely an anti-inflammatory
diet as well.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> He gave me a list of foods.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, basically,
eat these foods

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:11.727 align:middle line:90%
and don't eat these foods.

00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Because these foods
react well to your body,

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.120 align:middle line:90%
and these foods don't right now.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The things he was
telling me to cut out

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.730 align:middle line:84%
were things like wheat, gluten,
dairy, soy, corn, yeast,

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:90%
vinegar, nuts, seeds.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:27.240 align:middle line:84%
We walked out, I think,
unsure if I was really

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.930 align:middle line:84%
going to stick to his
protocol and if it was really

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:90%
going to work.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then oddly enough, I
woke up the next morning

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:42.060 align:middle line:84%
with pancreatitis and had
to go to the hospital.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I realized in a big way that
I have a pretty high level

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility when
it comes to my health

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and decided to follow Dr.
Mincolla's recommendations

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to a T. Once I got a ways
into following the protocol,

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:03.180 align:middle line:84%
realizing that I could get
healthy and was getting healthy

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and was healthy, it really made
me realize that I and we have

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.120 align:middle line:90%
the capacity to heal ourselves.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I was like, why is not
everybody shouting this

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:90%
from the rooftops?

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.820 align:middle line:84%
All this time, my body
was trying to talk to me.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.860 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
it spoke a language

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:18.750 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't understand.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It suddenly opened
up all of this space

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:25.680 align:middle line:90%
to explore other things.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, how can I
become even healthier?

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And how can I not only make
my body healthy, but how

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.840 align:middle line:84%
can I make sure my mind
and my spirit are healthy?

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We worked spiritually
with her quite a bit,

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.530 align:middle line:84%
trying to get her to understand
that she didn't have to carry

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:44.310 align:middle line:84%
her stress in a daily nervous
system that was piqued.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:46.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people just
don't edit their stress.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.710 align:middle line:90%
They carry it.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.335 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
talked to her a lot

00:51:49.335 --> 00:51:51.240 align:middle line:84%
about changing her
whole chemistry

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.130 align:middle line:84%
at an emotional and a
mental level as well

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:55.500 align:middle line:90%
and not accepting that stress.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, a couple
of years later, really,

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I did look back and realize I'm
living the way that I was told

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.470 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be able to live.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that moment happened
while I was studying abroad.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.680 align:middle line:84%
You could say, maybe
proving my GI doctor wrong

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.920 align:middle line:84%
who seemed to not have a lot of
faith in the possibility of me

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.032 align:middle line:90%
going over there.

00:52:15.032 --> 00:52:16.740 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing that
this whole journey

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.750 align:middle line:84%
has given me and
seeing Dr. Mincolla

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:22.620 align:middle line:84%
has given me is a new
relationship with myself

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and the way that I
interact with myself.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:30.420 align:middle line:84%
There is some level, I believe,
of the divine in all of us.

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:12.320 align:middle line:90%
and injuries.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.670 align:middle line:90%
We have it, of course.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.290 align:middle line:84%
In wound healing, you
get a cut or a scratch,

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and it heals itself.

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:19.100 align:middle line:90%
The skin heals up.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The human body is actually
not a thing but a process.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's a process of recycling.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The blood is being
regenerated all the time.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And the intestinal
lining and the skin

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.460 align:middle line:90%
is continually being replaced.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So this ability to
heal and regenerate

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is just intrinsic to
the very nature of life.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Humans were healing
and regenerating

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and recovering from
diseases long before doctors

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.350 align:middle line:90%
came along or even shamans.

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:54.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, everything that is
alive on the planet today

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.090 align:middle line:84%
has had ancestors
that have survived

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:57.530 align:middle line:90%
for several billion years.

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, none of
us would be here.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So we rely on this intrinsic
healing capacity of the body.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And the healing
capacity is influenced

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.660 align:middle line:90%
by nutrition, the environment.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's also influenced by
emotional and mental factors.

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Your consciousness is
translating your experiences

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:90%
into chemistry.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And that chemistry
could be chemistry

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that supports health
or chemistry that

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:90%
supports protection.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So we find ourselves in a
mutual exclusive situation.

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Am I in growth, or
am I in protection?

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I say, well then, it's based
where your thoughts are.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been very interested
in the phenomenon of gratitude,

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.560 align:middle line:84%
particularly in our
cardiac patients.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.930 align:middle line:84%
It's really been remarkable, in
the sense of the literal power

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.870 align:middle line:84%
when you help a person
activate and engage

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.430 align:middle line:90%
in some of these foundational--

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:46.040 align:middle line:84%
I consider them attributes
of the soul itself--

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and bring it more as a daily
activity, and practice,

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.980 align:middle line:90%
and perception in their life.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They change spiritually,
get healthier,

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and depressed mood reduces.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Their fatigue level reduces.

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.190 align:middle line:84%
We've done a lot of blood
work on these patients looking

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:84%
at traditional biomarkers
of cardiac function.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:07.490 align:middle line:84%
These go down dramatically,
which normally doesn't happen.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But for example, we had a
group of patients randomized

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.470 align:middle line:90%
keeping a gratitude journal.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And we asked them
every day, please

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:17.960 align:middle line:84%
write down two or three things
that you're grateful for.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.405 align:middle line:10%
At the end of those
eight weeks, the patients

00:55:20.405 --> 00:55:22.280 align:middle line:10%
who had been assigned
to gratitude journaling

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:27.410 align:middle line:10%
had about a 24% reduction
in the inflammatory load

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:28.640 align:middle line:10%
as we measured it.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And the patients who
continued as usual care,

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:33.300 align:middle line:84%
they either stayed
the way they were,

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.190 align:middle line:84%
or they got a little bit worse
over those two month period.

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:37.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is very powerful.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.060 align:middle line:10%
>> When we're feeling things
like compassion, love,

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.210 align:middle line:10%
gratitude, kindness, we
naturally go into more heart

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:46.550 align:middle line:10%
coherence, which is, if you
look at it on the graph,

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.800 align:middle line:10%
it's a sine wave looking rhythm.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But to have that
rhythmic pattern

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:54.080 align:middle line:84%
means a lot of beneficial things
had to go on inside of our body

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.570 align:middle line:90%
for that to occur.

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:57.885 align:middle line:84%
It's reflecting not only
increased synchronization

00:55:57.885 --> 00:55:59.510 align:middle line:84%
within the different
parts of our brain

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and nervous system
but synchronization

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.260 align:middle line:84%
between our blood
pressure rhythms,

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:84%
our heart rhythms, our
respiratory rhythms.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.750 align:middle line:84%
The heart and brain, they get
measurably more synchronized.

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's we now know
many hundreds of studies

00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:12.470 align:middle line:84%
later that this is
an optimal state.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:16.340 align:middle line:10%
When you're feeling frustrated,
or anxious, or overwhelmed,

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.520 align:middle line:10%
or these types of feelings,
the heart's rhythm,

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.950 align:middle line:10%
the pattern of it becomes
very chaotic looking.

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:25.730 align:middle line:10%
So that is literally reflecting
a lack of synchronized activity

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.570 align:middle line:10%
within the brain
and nervous system.

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:29.153 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why a lot of people

00:56:29.153 --> 00:56:30.440 align:middle line:90%
call them negative emotions.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And when people
are depressed,

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's a common feature
typically of cardiac disease,

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.330 align:middle line:84%
depression itself tends to be
a phenomenon of contraction

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.130 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.830 align:middle line:84%
People feel more
and more isolated.

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But gratitude as a
practice is an opening.

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a willingness
and a reopening out

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.070 align:middle line:90%
to the world around them.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.933 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
patients would report.

00:56:51.933 --> 00:56:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> While we talked
about what fear does,

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.660 align:middle line:84%
releasing the stress hormones
into the system that readjust

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:59.810 align:middle line:84%
the physiology of the body,
we also have to recognize that

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:03.530 align:middle line:84%
love also releases chemistry
but totally different chemistry

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:04.430 align:middle line:90%
than fear.

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Love releases
wonderful chemicals

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:08.060 align:middle line:90%
such as dopamine, pleasure.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.620 align:middle line:90%
We release vasopressin.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.420 align:middle line:84%
That makes the partners
attractive to each other.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.030 align:middle line:90%
So that holds that bond.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.290 align:middle line:10%
The bonding is from
oxytocin released

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:20.240 align:middle line:10%
in love, which says, connect
with this source of love.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And growth hormone,
and that name

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.680 align:middle line:84%
is, obviously, it causes
a growth and maintenance

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.640 align:middle line:90%
of the system.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Because love is the
chemistry of health.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Stress is the chemistry
of protection.

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well then, I'm
changing the environment inside

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.680 align:middle line:90%
based on the consciousness.

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The fundamental common
element has to do with

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:41.000 align:middle line:90%
connectivity.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.020 align:middle line:84%
The average person lives a
life of perceived separation

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:48.470 align:middle line:84%
from other people in their
environment, from the world

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think since that is
a fundamental illusion,

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.490 align:middle line:84%
the presence of that illusion
in the person's psyche

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is always a bit of a strain and
a stress as the time goes on.

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:02.230 align:middle line:90%

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The mind is not the brain.

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:09.560 align:middle line:84%
The brain is a biological form
that lives inside your skull.

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like a heart, a liver,
a kidney, and a gallbladder.

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But the mind is a very
different property.

00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:17.800 align:middle line:90%
It's an infinite property.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I always like to say that
the brain is somewhere.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:22.980 align:middle line:90%
The mind is everywhere.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We have an understanding
of consciousness,

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.050 align:middle line:84%
which is controlling our
biology, is in our head.

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:28.393 align:middle line:90%
We put wires on a person's head.

00:58:28.393 --> 00:58:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's called
electroencephalograph.

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:31.332 align:middle line:90%
I'm reading brain function.

00:58:31.332 --> 00:58:32.540 align:middle line:90%
I say, yeah, but where is it?

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.870 align:middle line:90%
It's inside the head.

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.255 align:middle line:84%
And electrical activity
is conducted to the skin.

00:58:36.255 --> 00:58:37.880 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
electrodes pick it up.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a new device called
magnetoencephalograph, not

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.250 align:middle line:90%
EEG, MEG.

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:45.830 align:middle line:90%
And this is mind blowing.

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:48.710 align:middle line:84%
The probe doesn't
touch the body at all.

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:50.360 align:middle line:90%
The probe is out here.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're reading the
consciousness activity

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.140 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:56.600 align:middle line:90%
The point is this.

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are not
contained in your head.

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:02.030 align:middle line:84%
You are broadcasting your
thoughts into the field.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of us have had
experiences of being around

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.680 align:middle line:84%
someone, where we left
feeling really charged up

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.710 align:middle line:90%
or the opposite.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:08.930 align:middle line:90%
We felt drained.

00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:11.720 align:middle line:84%
My emotions actually
go beyond my skin.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.190 align:middle line:90%
They affect others.

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:16.610 align:middle line:84%
My thoughts actually affect
the field of energy around me

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:17.870 align:middle line:90%
and can affect others.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.327 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're in the heart
coherent state, loving,

00:59:20.327 --> 00:59:22.910 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, and kind states,
there are several studies that

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.760 align:middle line:84%
are now showing that that
actually has a lifting effect

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.840 align:middle line:90%
on the others within our field.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So our nervous systems seem
to be exquisitely tuned

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:34.590 align:middle line:84%
to the magnetic fields
produced by other people.

00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything made out of
energy is interconnected,

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.440 align:middle line:90%
because energy has no barriers.

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.170 align:middle line:84%
That means everything
in the universe

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:44.300 align:middle line:90%
is part of the same energy.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And that means no separation.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient medical systems were
based on spiritual traditions

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that understood the
interconnection between spirit,

Earth, the elements, our
bodies, and our emotions.

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:58.870 align:middle line:90%
They are all connected.

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, this may seem really
like, how does that work?

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But basically, they had worked
out these systems really well.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we experience
as pain, depression,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.530 align:middle line:84%
is really due to
a lack of harmony

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.480 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves
and our environment.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's really based on
a different cosmology.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.950 align:middle line:84%
From a biofield point
of view, the biofield

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:17.810 align:middle line:84%
is basically giving
us information

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.180 align:middle line:84%
about our sense of harmony with
ourselves and our environment.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So when acupuncturists
talk about stuck energy,

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:26.390 align:middle line:84%
or an energy healer
says, you've got

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.280 align:middle line:84%
energy stuck in a
particular chakra

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.530 align:middle line:84%
or a meridian, what
they're talking about

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
is an imbalance in
the system that needs

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.730 align:middle line:90%
to be moving towards harmony.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the more we pay attention
to these subtle aspects

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
of being, the energetic feelings
that we get from everything

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
around us, from our
emotions, our thoughts,

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.925 align:middle line:84%
our interactions, the more we're
realizing we're not separate.

01:00:46.925 --> 01:00:50.138 align:middle line:90%

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Diane, and I've
been a patient of Mark Mincolla

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:56.830 align:middle line:90%
for 36 years.

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:02.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the main issues that we
addressed during those 36 years

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.730 align:middle line:90%
was my being an addict.

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I gave up alcohol when I was 26.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And I went on to bigger
and better things,

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.090 align:middle line:90%
thinking nothing.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think I
was an addict, really.

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:13.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in the music business.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
So in the '70s, cocaine was it.

01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.010 align:middle line:90%
It was great to have it.

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I was powerful.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I could give it to
everybody and celebrate.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that it
was not an addictive drug.

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And for the next eight
years after I started,

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty much
a living hell.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I functioned.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.310 align:middle line:90%
I worked.

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I did all the things you
do, but spiritually, I

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.240 align:middle line:90%
was just getting broken down.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I was going to a therapist.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.490 align:middle line:90%
I was very messed up.

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel
well physically.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's only one
person I know for you to go to.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was so desperate
I didn't care who it

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:50.440 align:middle line:90%
was at that moment I thought.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked
into his office.

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I left saying, I'm
not going back there.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.580 align:middle line:90%
He's just not a good fit for me.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.020 align:middle line:90%
He's too arrogant.

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.290 align:middle line:90%
So I'm back to therapy.

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And I progressively got
worse, mentally, physically,

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:03.830 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And the physical aspect
was getting horrible.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.475 align:middle line:84%
And the therapist
said, I can't help you

01:02:10.475 --> 01:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want to
see Mark Mincolla.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.420 align:middle line:90%
You got to go.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And I walked in.

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I told him I
didn't like him.

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I told him I thought
he was arrogant

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.500 align:middle line:90%
but that I was desperate.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And I needed someone to help
me, and I sat there with my arms

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:27.770 align:middle line:84%
like this the whole
time in fighting mode.

01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me at one point,

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I'm
here for you forever,

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:34.752 align:middle line:90%
whatever, doesn't matter.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
You can be whoever,
because I said,

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not giving up cocaine.

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:39.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's OK.

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:40.290 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm here for you,
and that was it.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So when a patient like
Diane comes in and sees me,

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I just made it my number one
obligation not to go to her

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.567 align:middle line:90%
spirit but to go to my soul.

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Because if I go to your spirit,
I'm going to go down with you.

01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason
energy is contagious is

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
because you're coming from
a place that's not source.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.208 align:middle line:84%
So the person that's with
you is not in source.

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:01.008 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

01:03:01.008 --> 01:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to be in source.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So by the same token,
Diane comes in.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.730 align:middle line:90%
She's in broken-spirited mode.

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going there.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to my soul.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:13.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ground both of us.

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a contagion there
that's more powerful.

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> When I went there, I
strictly went there for physical

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:19.550 align:middle line:90%
purposes I thought.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.320 align:middle line:90%
But there's something about him.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
When you walk in his office,
he knows who you are,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.650 align:middle line:90%
not your mind, not your story.

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
He knows the essence
of your being,

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and right away the
healing starts.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I was living thinking, well, I
came from messed up background.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.800 align:middle line:90%
I blamed it on everybody.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
the root of it was.

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So self contempt is
something that's been programmed

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.120 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.790 align:middle line:90%
We tend to feel shame, doubt.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
We tend to feel negative
feelings about the concept

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.510 align:middle line:90%
of self being deserving.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say, I want you to
picture yourself as a child.

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Go home and search through
all your photographs.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.485 align:middle line:84%
Find yourself as a five-year-old
kid, a six-year-old kid.

01:04:02.485 --> 01:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And look at that picture
that five or six-year-old,

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and there's two things
I wanted to look for,

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:09.410 align:middle line:90%
deservedness and innocence.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
After years and years
of living in this world,

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.370 align:middle line:90%
we tend to lose the innocence.

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
We tend to lose the
sense of deservedness.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:23.000 align:middle line:84%
We associate our deservedness
with our innocence.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So can we associate deservedness
with the loss of innocence?

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.100 align:middle line:90%
That's extremely important.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And we forgive ourselves
for growing up.

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
To really overcome
dis-ease, we have

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to embrace
and forgive ourselves

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
for being adults and to love
ourselves at a core level,

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:43.630 align:middle line:90%
not at an ego level.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to love
ourselves conditionally.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about loving yourself

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.130 align:middle line:90%
because you won the lottery.

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:52.035 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about having a
core love of that child that

01:04:52.035 --> 01:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
was five and six
years old that's

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:54.920 align:middle line:90%
still living in your heart.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>> He would do that work on
me to go in and really nurture

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:00.260 align:middle line:90%
myself.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to reflect on
the kindness that I do have,

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:06.070 align:middle line:90%
the tenderness, the love.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And all he wanted me to do
was, instead of putting it

01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:11.610 align:middle line:84%
all on the outside, was to take
it in and put it on the inside.

01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I got off the
cocaine, didn't drink.

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But sugar was the
essence of an addiction

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.350 align:middle line:90%
that, again, I was a little kid.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm three years old.

01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I had a tooth pulled.

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:24.130 align:middle line:90%
They gave me a lollipop.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.005 align:middle line:90%
I did something else.

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:25.805 align:middle line:90%
I fell down.

01:05:25.805 --> 01:05:27.010 align:middle line:90%
A doctor gave me ice cream.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So for me, sugar was nurturing.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
It was loving, and
little did I know what

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
it was really doing to me also.

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I was getting progressively
sick again and just

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
filled with mucus,
to a point where

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:38.800 align:middle line:90%
I thought I had pneumonia.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.970 align:middle line:84%
It was horrible, and
I lived like that.

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.100 align:middle line:90%
And I thought I was dying.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.475 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying,
Diane, you've

01:05:43.475 --> 01:05:44.908 align:middle line:90%
got to give up the sugar.

01:05:44.908 --> 01:05:45.950 align:middle line:90%
You've got to give it up.

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Addiction is
compensation for hurt.

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I have a hole in my
heart that doesn't heal.

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Addiction takes
sugar, love, money,

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
whatever from the
outside and attempts

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
to patch up that hole in
the heart, which lasts

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.310 align:middle line:90%
for a short period of time.

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
To heal the heart
from the inside out

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is to occupy your own heart
with your consciousness,

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to venture and journey into your
own heart, to admit the pain,

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.642 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge the pain,
to confront the pain,

01:06:20.642 --> 01:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
to feel the pain
all the way through.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> That pain transformed
things in me,

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
where I have been reconnecting
with letting go of the fight.

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people can be
addicted to substances.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They can be addicted
to behaviors.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I think control is one of
the most powerful addictions

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:42.050 align:middle line:90%
that I see every day.

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:43.892 align:middle line:84%
One of most powerful
healing agents

01:06:43.892 --> 01:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
is when people finally
get clear about the fact

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that, by letting go,
they support flow and not

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.360 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I would cry a lot.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I would feel, and I
didn't even want to feel.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I certainly didn't want to
cry in an office like that.

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:57.580 align:middle line:90%
But that's his magic.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.510 align:middle line:84%
That's one of his magics that
he can just penetrate the heart.

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I had a very
profound spiritual experience.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It just hit me between the
eyeballs to get on my knees

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
and ask God for help.

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:12.430 align:middle line:90%
And I gave up sugar.

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had sugar,
other than some fruit,

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
in eight or 10 years,
which is a miracle.

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I knew I could go somewhere
where somebody unconditionally

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
cared about me and was willing
to hold the space until I

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.580 align:middle line:90%
caught up with it.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have Mark
Mincolla in my life,

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and I just went to a
psychiatrist, a regular one,

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.450 align:middle line:90%
or I went to a regular doctor--

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.500 align:middle line:90%
not putting them down.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their
purpose, but in my life,

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I'd be here today.

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We misidentify with
a persona, a mask.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
The actors in ancient Greek
drama, or tragedy, or comedy,

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.920 align:middle line:90%
they were wearing masks.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.350 align:middle line:90%
As an actor, we wear a mask.

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Let me propose that,
as human beings,

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
we are aware what is
known as human nature.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a mask.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
When you take it off,
that mask, what is behind?

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We're programmed in this
culture and in the Western

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
world to believe that self
is a personality with an ego.

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And self is all
about value that has

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:24.939 align:middle line:84%
to do with performance at a
certain level, I guess I'd say.

01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And having a doctoral
degree in health,

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.015 align:middle line:84%
all these things make me
more attractive to myself.

01:08:30.015 --> 01:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But if I don't
have those things,

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:32.848 align:middle line:84%
or if I lose those
things, then I'm

01:08:32.848 --> 01:08:37.075 align:middle line:84%
certainly not worth my own
love, and attention, and care.

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not feeling loving.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.242 align:middle line:90%
I'm not feeling complete.

01:08:39.242 --> 01:08:41.069 align:middle line:90%
I'm not feeling whole.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think it starts with a
re-identification of self,

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
not as an ego, not
as a personality,

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.160 align:middle line:84%
not as a cellular
being but as a soul.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to love
a soul than it is an ego.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people that I
counsel get in their own way

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.779 align:middle line:90%
and don't really know it.

01:08:55.779 --> 01:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
They're not totally
aware of it, but there's

01:08:57.670 --> 01:08:58.930 align:middle line:90%
a lack of faith in self.

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a lack of love in
self, a lack of belief in self,

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:04.310 align:middle line:84%
a lack of willingness
to accept power.

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:05.560 align:middle line:90%
It kind of intimidates people.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Little old me having power?

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.498 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I trust that.

01:09:08.498 --> 01:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I deserve that.

01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The fundamental
thing that, really,

01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
all healers say that really is
the common denominator of what

01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:17.229 align:middle line:84%
healing is, it's
not about curing.

01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:19.104 align:middle line:84%
It's not about ridding
ourselves of something

01:09:19.104 --> 01:09:20.200 align:middle line:90%
that we don't want.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It's turning towards that which
causes us suffering and holding

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.604 align:middle line:90%
it in a space of love.

01:09:25.604 --> 01:09:26.979 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is helping

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
us open to that space of love.

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And fundamentally, it's
for us to love ourselves.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
in the outside world

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of
our inside world.

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Healing in part on the
level of the mind is to be able

01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to have a deeper understanding
of the expansiveness of our own

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.200 align:middle line:90%
nature.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.029 align:middle line:84%
There's a field of what's called
transpersonal psychology, which

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
endeavors to understand the
different features and times

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
when that phenomenon can occur.

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
If a person has this belief
that they are their thoughts

01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
or some specifics of
their environment,

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and something happens, whether
it's a beautiful sunset,

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
for example, where they
just go a little bit

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.250 align:middle line:84%
beyond that current identity
they believe themselves to be.

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:10.765 align:middle line:90%
And they find there's something.

01:10:10.765 --> 01:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
They're a little bigger,
or they encompass more

01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:14.200 align:middle line:90%
than they thought.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
That's a transpersonal
phenomenon as it's called.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so many realms of
healing, I believe,

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.870 align:middle line:90%
attempt to induce these effects.

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to understand
that we're capable of tapping

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.620 align:middle line:90%
into an inner self.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher self
emanating from the soul

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
self, a higher self more than
capable of performing miracles.

01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> What is that
invisible, formless,

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
infinite entity that knows
itself as the experience that

01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
we call the visible
or the material?

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:51.110 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And do you know it?

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you know who or what you are?

01:10:56.450 --> 01:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> At the ego level,
there's separation.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.070 align:middle line:90%
There's compartmentalization.

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a super conscious higher
level, the Atman level,

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.990 align:middle line:90%
the Brahman level.

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:08.430 align:middle line:90%
There's only one.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no more than one.

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Healing is the return of
the memory of wholeness from

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
the fragmented mind to the
whole mind and finding out that

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:21.000 align:middle line:84%
you're a timeless being having
a time bound experience.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%

talks about the soul that is

impervious.

The arrows can't pierce it.

The swords can't pierce it.

A spirit can be broken.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.890 align:middle line:90%
The heart can be broken.

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Body can be broken.

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:31.260 align:middle line:90%
The mind can be broken.

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.310 align:middle line:90%

01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
For four years, we
planned this documentary.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And to my mind, we
were thinking in terms

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
of bringing patients
in that have

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:45.868 align:middle line:84%
gone through remarkable
miraculous recoveries.

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I never dreamed for
a minute that I'd

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:48.970 align:middle line:90%
be involved in that process.

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Unexpectedly, I
contracted Lyme disease.

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, it
just pulled the legs out

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.110 align:middle line:90%
from under me.

01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I lost my balance.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:59.950 align:middle line:90%
I started to have tremors.

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I lost my strength.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%
The pain was just indescribable.

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:06.682 align:middle line:84%
And it was so difficult
for me to contend with,

01:12:06.682 --> 01:12:08.890 align:middle line:84%
because it seemed to get
worse, and worse, and worse,

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:10.150 align:middle line:90%
and worse.

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was worsening
for four years.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.255 align:middle line:84%
So one night, I
fell, hit my head.

01:12:15.255 --> 01:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the floor for
14 hours unable to move.

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I was paralyzed.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
To be isolated in your own
mind not knowing to what extent

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
you're paralyzed has a
way of just isolating you

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%
within your own soul.

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
There's talk about meditation
being a process, where

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
you get into your core self in
the form of pure consciousness,

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.450 align:middle line:90%
awareness not thought.

01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
When I say, my soul self,
I landed in this place

01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:46.720 align:middle line:90%
of pure awareness.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I just wasn't able to
think in that place which

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.070 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what I needed.

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:56.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a point at which we
make a decision to live or die.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
It's where we can
cross over the line.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that our
spirits can commit us

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.598 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

01:13:02.598 --> 01:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
had to walk to the end

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:09.198 align:middle line:84%
of my life in my mind and see
who I was and what I wanted.

01:13:09.198 --> 01:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So I had to make a
decision as to whether I

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:middle line:84%
was willful about
living or willful

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.450 align:middle line:90%
about not living anymore.

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I went to the edge of that
cliff, and I came back.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.068 align:middle line:84%
And I finally was
rescued off the floor.

01:13:20.068 --> 01:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a 10 day
period where I was

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:22.780 align:middle line:90%
unable to walk, unable to move.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to be carried
to the bathroom,

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know that
I'd ever get my walking back.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.992 align:middle line:84%
I never knew that I'd
get my strength back.

01:13:27.992 --> 01:13:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was permanently,
perhaps, permanently paralyzed.

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:34.468 align:middle line:84%
And that's a hell to live
through, not knowing.

01:13:34.468 --> 01:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So I finally had
gone to the hospital

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and spent four
days in a hospital

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.280 align:middle line:90%
and then a week in a rehab.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
They weren't sure
that I was going

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.200 align:middle line:90%
to be able to walk either.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Their determination was I
wasn't going to get better.

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I was going to stay the same
or get worse progressively.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
My first week in the rehab
hospital, I was in the gym

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
every day walking
with walkers, doing

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.873 align:middle line:90%
the exercises I was given.

01:13:54.873 --> 01:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were shocked at
how much time I spent there

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.230 align:middle line:90%
and how hard I pushed.

01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I was determined to
create my healing,

01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to energetically impose
the most powerful energy

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.300 align:middle line:90%
that I could to heal.

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.560 align:middle line:90%
To me, everything is energy.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Energy is about frequency.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It's about vibration.

01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
In the truest sense,
I believe that disease

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.420 align:middle line:90%
begins with dis-ease.

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The dis-ease in my
life started long

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
before the symptoms
of Lyme disease.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And dis-ease begins
with a certain level

01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:24.250 align:middle line:90%
of self ignorance.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a place deep within
that has to be connected with,

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
that keeps us well, that
keeps us from being dis-eased.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And I found that place
on the bathroom floor

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.170 align:middle line:90%
after about 14 hours.

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Embracing miracles
automatically insinuates

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.647 align:middle line:84%
that you have to embrace the
difficulty, the sickness,

01:14:42.647 --> 01:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
the stress, the thing
that brought you

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:45.700 align:middle line:90%
to a potential miracle.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Holism is always
happening, where

01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I was exposed to both sides
of the universal process, yin

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and yang, dark and
light, pain and joy.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.170 align:middle line:84%
We need to embrace the
whole, and make a decision

01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:00.783 align:middle line:84%
to embrace wholeness as it
is, not as we'd like it to be.

01:15:00.783 --> 01:15:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Part of my miracle
recovery is all

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
about being unified between mind
and body, coming from the soul

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and merging all parts
of self and unity.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't do anything
against myself anymore.

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%

happen in flow.
