Why?

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what if my
daughter didn't make it

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and I did have to take the kids?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:90%
I had no room.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:90%

Skid Row or the weekly moves

from one flea bag
hotel to the other.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:84%

to give her and the kids

completed the necessary rehab

getting her life together.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%

that she did everything

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:90%
they required of her.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:90%

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:84%
the reason why they did that
is because we are acknowledging

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:90%
the path of our ancestors.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
whole temple over here

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:84%
was only for the eternal
bodies of mummified masters.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
prophets, and were

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
others were leaders, governors,
masters, healers, and priests.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And because they were of very,
very important service while

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:84%
in their physical
temple, they had

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:90%
the privilege to be mummified.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
their temple was.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And in there, in this place
called Pumakaka, which we call

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the rock of the puma, is
these two carved figures

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:90%
you can see in the stone.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
The big one over
there is a puma that

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
perhaps was looking towards
south or towards this side.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But when the Spaniards found
it, they cut the head off,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
destroying the power
of the Inca people,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.830 align:middle line:84%
because the puma
represented that.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And in this huge
platform used to happen

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:90%
the most important ceremonies.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet the puma was not facing
towards the ceremonial site,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
but rather is facing this
way where perhaps this is

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
the place where
the most important

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:90%
spiritual leaders used to come.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And there were, at the same
time, generals and warriors,

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and they would initiate boys
and girls into being a man

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and a woman, highly
enlightened, self-realized,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and at this point, they
have already lived,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle line:84%
they have already
experienced all the emotions.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:84%
They have already
seen everything

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
because they are
preparing as they

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:90%
are ready to give a new life.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:90%
And yet their age is 13.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.293 align:middle line:84%
So boys and girls
would be initiated

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:90%
here at the age of 13.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And what is so beautiful
that it still exists here

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
as the essence,
that the Spaniards

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.822 align:middle line:90%
didn't find the little figure.

00:19:31.822 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Or they found it,
they didn't touch it.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:84%
The little figure
is a baby puma.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
There's the front crossed
legged, the head, the body,

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:90%
the back legs, and the tail.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful part about
that is that the baby

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.120 align:middle line:90%
puma is yet to wake up.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives us the
hope in children and in youth

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
here in Chinchero, that there
have been an essence left

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
for all the children, for all
the young people, for them

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
to go-- like perhaps in
the path I went it was

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:90%
initiated by this baby puma.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I had to wake up
from being asleep.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So that is why it is
necessary to go to sleep

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:90%
in order to wake up, huh?

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but while
the destructive energy came,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:84%
the puma was sleeping, and
that was its protection.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting
medicine, no?

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And the puma in the
Andes as our cosmo vision

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:90%
is the power of will.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And the power of will does
not come from the mind

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%
as it is usually known.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
The power of will
comes from the heart.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
power of the puma.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
needed to wake up.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
That is why we were
here in this altar.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And when the power of will,
which moves everything

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
in the whole cosmos, wakes
up, and when you realize

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that its root really is the
heart, and it's not your head,

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
it's not your limitations,
it's not your fears,

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
then I understood that it really
doesn't matter what you do.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
That power of will
is actually cosmic,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and it will take you
to the directions

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:90%
you are meant to arrive.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
That really you might
choose, but you don't decide.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:90%
The cosmos decides.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is perhaps, when it
was decided by the cosmos,

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.870 align:middle line:84%
we needed to wake up
that puma inside us here.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is why this
medicine is the medicine

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
for the whole world, especially
for the young people,

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:90%
for the children.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they are the
stewards of life.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
They are the
guardians of the path.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And the elders are not
so much even leaders.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:84%
They are witnesses of
a new life happening,

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:90%
and a new life happening again.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:90%
That is why we say there is iny.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a moment when we
look after our children,

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and that moment is so
delicate because we need

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.294 align:middle line:90%
to be guardians of their path.

00:22:30.294 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And in a thousandth of a second
that changes, and our children

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:90%
need to look after us.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
So there is that iny.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, a
lot of parents take

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
for granted their being parents,
and they think they always

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
have to look after the
children, and they forget

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:90%
to be looked after, you know?

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And there is the iny, there's
the sharing of the love,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:84%
there is the connection
of the family also.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
When in that order,
families separate,

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
when that order families
split, in the cosmos

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.685 align:middle line:90%
there's a huge unbalance.

00:23:09.685 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
In the cosmos is created what
we call perhaps scientifically

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:84%
a black hole, a portal, so that
it can take all the sorrow, all

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
the traumas, all the
fears, all the pain,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
all the emotional
heaviness and transmute it.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Take it to another
dimension of light, of love.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, that
process in the microcosmos

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:90%
is huge.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:90%
It is devastating.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes with that process,
it can take whole galaxies.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:84%
It can take whole
planetary systems.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
here in Chinchero

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
the relationship of family
is so delicate that it is

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.495 align:middle line:90%
so precious, it is so sacred.

00:24:02.495 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
You don't take it for
granted, whether it

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:84%
is your partner, your
children, your parents,

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:90%
your grandparents.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't take your
family for granted.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:10%
And you are the one who has the
responsibility to not only help

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:10%
it heal and guard it, but
also to lead it, to take it

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:10%
to a whole different
level of life

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:10%
where you go through the process
of emotions through the hurts,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:10%
through the traumas.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And then to a level
of celebration,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:90%
to a level of sharing.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:90%
But always together.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is necessary,
I think, in the world,

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that everybody has
to have a mentor,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
has to have someone
who will tell

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:90%
them to the right or the left.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And in it, my
grandfather would say,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
you have to listen to
yourself first and last.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
PAM: Puma didn't know about
the situation I left behind.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I seemed to be
addressing my own fears,

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:84%
my guilt. Was I
wrong in leaving?

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be the
guardian of my daughter's

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.830 align:middle line:90%
path, her mentor, and I ran.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But then he tells me
that I need to let

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
go, like the
nesting bird pushing

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.558 align:middle line:90%
the babies out of the nest.

00:25:32.558 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I pondered his messages as we
loaded our gear on the horses

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.035 align:middle line:84%
and proceeded to the
top of the glacier.

00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It was dark when we
finally reached the summit.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.172 align:middle line:84%
I gasped at the
brightness of the stars.

00:25:50.172 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:90%
I'd never seen the Milky Way.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So close you feel as
though you can almost

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%
touch it with your fingers.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Exhausted and shivering
from the cold,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Puma covered me with a tarp as
the singing and pounding drums

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.635 align:middle line:90%
continued throughout the night.

00:26:07.635 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I awoke to
see an entire community that

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
had gathered on top this
glacier, 16,000 feet above sea

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:90%
level in the Sinaqara Valley.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that this glacier
has been rapidly disappearing,

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and that just 10 years ago, the
area where we are now camping

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
used to be totally
submerged in snow and ice.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
As I shivered from the
cold, I watched these people

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:84%
dancing and singing,
most of them barefoot

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.136 align:middle line:90%
or wearing just sandals.

00:26:42.136 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I was overwhelmed by the
faith of these people.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Over 100,000 people
come up here every year

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:90%
to celebrate Qoillorritti.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Qoillorritti is an
annual event that

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
has been kept in
secret for many years,

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:84%
but has its origins dating
back to early Inca times.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
The tradition is to
go up to the glacier

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and gather the ice as new water,
as new life, a new direction.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
These are people who come
from various lifestyles,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
various communities,
far away distances.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And not just from Peru,
but some journeying

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
all the way from North
America, Europe, Asia.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And these people,
just like me, come

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:84%
perhaps not consciously
knowing what

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:90%
this pilgrimage is all about.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.896 align:middle line:84%
And yet I am told that we
will all receive the healing,

00:27:39.896 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that all of this harmonized
and healed energy

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:84%
is going to be for
the land to where

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.206 align:middle line:84%
we came from, for our families,
and for our communities.

00:27:48.206 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
As we proceeded
down the mountains,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned to Puma
what Edemir had told

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.875 align:middle line:90%
me about being from Atlantis.

00:27:59.875 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:84%
He must have sensed
my disbelief.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Before I knew it,
12 hours later,

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:90%
I found myself in Bolivia.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We'll be entering into what
is the realm of our ancestors.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:10%
Humanity before this one
were perhaps belonging

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.920 align:middle line:10%
to the Atlantean civilizations.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be entering into
the mysteries of these people,

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and what message they
left for these times

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and for the humanity now.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:84%
They say that the era of
133 years before Christ

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
through 900 after Christ was the
best part of Tiwanaku culture.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this is only
the physical signs.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And knowing how limited it
has been in its research

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and in its way of
finding out really,

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.780 align:middle line:84%
this culture has developed
much more before that,

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and its best times were
always at the beginning.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Because later, because of
weather or because of whatever

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:84%
situations, this culture had
to also struggle to survive

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and had to move to different
parts of the Andes.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the Inca
civilization even is born.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:84%
The origins of this
whole civilization

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
is here, in this
place, in this land.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:90%
This is the roots.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the source.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And like always in the
saying of the elders,

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:84%
you must always remember
where you come from.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
There's your power, there's your
roots, there's your strength.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we
are here in Tiwanaku.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And here we are in what they
call the underground temple.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the place where they
found the monolith of Bennett,

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:90%
as they call it.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:90%
The monolith of Mother Earth.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:44.505 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, all
the rocks extending out

00:29:44.505 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:84%
represent the different
races of humanity.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
a temple dedicated

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:90%
to the races of humanity.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Asian, African, everywhere.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.680 align:middle line:90%
You name one, it's here.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And the head represents where
our brain, where our mind is.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And knowing how limited,
knowing how rational are,

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:84%
in these temples
is where they used

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to heal the head of the whole
of humanity in our planet.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the place
where they would take

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:84%
the limited mentality,
the rationality,

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:90%
the making sense of everything.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:84%
They were able to heal
that here in this temple.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say
that healing does not

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:90%
happen at an individual level.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it happen at
a family level and community

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:84%
level, it happens in
temples like this,

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:84%
happening to the level
of races of humanity.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.810 align:middle line:84%
That's at the level
we need to heal.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Globally.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:90%
PAM: A chill ran up my back.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Was this another
sign of recognition?

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Puma explained that
sites such as this

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:84%
were erected as actual doors or
portals used by our ancestors

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.830 align:middle line:84%
to receive the knowledge
of the universe

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:84%
directly from the heavens,
giving each of us that innate

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:84%
wisdom, and connecting us
with the beings of light

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:90%
from other galaxies.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Further down the
road, we entered

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:90%
into a new archaeological dig.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:90%
PUMA: Puma Gate.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:84%
That is a recent name that
it had put to this place.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:10%
What we will appreciate
here in terms of symbols,

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:10%
in terms of carvings, in terms
of highly advanced technology

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:10%
in working with rock, belongs
to the Lemurian people

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:10%
who were the ancestors
of the Atlanteans.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.660 align:middle line:10%
And because in the
Atlantean civilization

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:10%
there were many events
happening where they broke

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:10%
many cosmic laws, also
where they brought life

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.350 align:middle line:10%
to an unbalance, that
way Mother Earth had

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:10%
to use her four
elements in order

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.250 align:middle line:10%
to purify and clean herself.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And with that, the
Atlantean civilization was

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:90%
going to disappear completely.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And with that, also the
ancestry of the Lemurian people.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:84%
The Mu people were the
ancestors of the Atlanteans.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And because of the technology,
because of the magnitude

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:43.630 align:middle line:84%
of carving and work in here
and of knowing all the laws

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos of
basically using levity

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:53.785 align:middle line:84%
has the polarity of gravity and
taking the molecular weight out

00:32:53.785 --> 00:32:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of the rocks, such
technologies were

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:90%
only known by these people.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, perhaps,
we called this Pumapunko

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.340 align:middle line:90%
as the last Lemurian portal.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a portal.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a place that tells you
that your eyes are portals,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that your ear--
hearing is portals,

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:90%
that your words are portals.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.235 align:middle line:84%
That your whole temple is a
portal, that your heart is

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
a portal, that
your belly button,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.950 align:middle line:84%
your navel is a portal, that
your sexual gland is a portal.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:36.140 align:middle line:84%
That you as a woman have a womb,
that there's a portal into.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Everything is portals.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.205 align:middle line:84%
And you choose to
be open or closed.

00:33:40.205 --> 00:33:43.590 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:84%
PAM: As we began our journey
back to Peru I asked Puma,

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
people out there

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
representing themselves
as spiritual guides,

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.660 align:middle line:90%
leaders of the path.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you recognize true
or false prophets, guides?

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.390 align:middle line:84%
PUMA: While we're looking for
guides, while we're looking

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
for guidance, with
this intent that which

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:84%
maintains us on the path,
which is the sacred fire.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Sacred fire that is in each
human being, in every person.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:84%
That besides their thinking,
besides their personality,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.439 align:middle line:84%
besides their way of being,
they are already that light.

00:34:25.439 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
They are already
that sacred spirit.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.489 align:middle line:84%
And when you look, when
you see at a person,

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:34.020 align:middle line:90%
you see that sacred fire.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:84%
You see that love,
in spite of whatever

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.239 align:middle line:90%
else is their appearance.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And you listen, and
you respect, and you

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:90%
honor that being, that person.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Being on a path, being
in life with the process.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.380 align:middle line:90%
And you listen.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Because grandfather
would say, in the people

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:02.480 align:middle line:84%
that you less think of, there
is where your teachers are.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:90%
There is where your guides are.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:90%
So you don't look for them.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:90%
They will find you.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.780 align:middle line:84%
PAM: As we left Bolivia,
I mentioned to Puma

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that I had overheard
some of my travel mates

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:84%
talk about the end of the
Mayan calendar in 2012,

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and the subsequent destruction
of earth as we know it.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.220 align:middle line:84%
As we waited for the bus,
Puma explained this in terms

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:90%
used by the Quechua elders.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
PUMA: We have here what
we call a taripay pacha,

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:34.660 align:middle line:84%
a time in which we're entering
into a major transition

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.130 align:middle line:90%
as humanity.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Earth will
allow a lot of our healing

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of our spiritual
growth and awakening

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:90%
in this transition.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:50.420 align:middle line:10%
We call it first
there is pachacuti.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:10%
Pachacuti is a time and space.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Ancient energies, ancient
wisdom, ancient knowledge,

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:08.150 align:middle line:84%
ancestors coming back
and reorganizing.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Helping us wake up, helping
us heal, helping us transform.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.920 align:middle line:84%
That is what we
call a pachacuti.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:10%
In the process, we have to
go through a taripay pacha.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:10%
Taripay pacha
means not a new way

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:10%
of life, not new steps in life.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But rather that time and space
will catch up with our growth.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the eternal
knowledge, the eternal wisdom,

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and the eternal
consciousness will again

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.450 align:middle line:90%
be integrated into our lives.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And that will
allow our awakening

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and our transformation in
this moment of transition

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that Mother Earth
is going through,

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.080 align:middle line:84%
which will also affect the whole
cosmos and the whole universe.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So the taripay pacha
is for all of us

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to become the elders, for all
of us to become the wise ones,

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:84%
for all of us to become
the healers, the leaders.

PAM: Once back in Peru, our
first stop was in Cusco, where

00:37:13.562 --> 00:37:16.000 align:middle line:10%
I received a follow-up
from my ankle injury,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.250 align:middle line:10%
and I was introduced to
Mother Irene, a local healer.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.150 align:middle line:84%
PUMA: This little
baby got burned three

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.900 align:middle line:90%
days ago with very hot stuff.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:90%
So he's back.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:90%
He's hurt.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.754 align:middle line:90%
But they're going to heal.

[BABY CRYING]

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Whenever children have
these problems, what

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.670 align:middle line:84%
they need healing for
is not only the body,

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:90%
but also for the spirit.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So they're taking care of the
energetic part of the baby.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:90%
They will be healing its spirit.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And whatever traumas or
whatever fear that the baby has

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.980 align:middle line:90%
will be liberated and cleansed.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.640 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.270 align:middle line:84%
In three days, you
could see how the body

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.360 align:middle line:90%
has recuperated so fast.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Because they use natural herbs.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Irene has everything
prepared ready.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:84%
PAM: And this was a burn from
the fireplace from an oven,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:90%
PUMA: Yeah.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But the physical part is not
the most important, you see?

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
children, when they

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.170 align:middle line:84%
go through these experiences,
they catch a very strong trauma

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
because their psychological
temple is 10 times more

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable than
ours as an adult.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So it is important to heal the
emotional and the spiritual

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:84%
part also, because
that is going to affect

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.215 align:middle line:84%
the rest of their lives,
even when they become adults.

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:41.100 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The same thing's
happening to the baby

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.760 align:middle line:84%
over there too, because
he fell down on the steps.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
trying to heal all

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.140 align:middle line:90%
the trauma that he might have.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Notice how the
child is completely

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:84%
focused, and
receives the healing.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.532 align:middle line:84%
Because they learn from very
young that this is important.

00:39:05.532 --> 00:39:09.404 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:09.404 --> 00:39:11.824 align:middle line:90%


00:39:11.824 --> 00:39:13.276 align:middle line:90%
PUMA: OK.

00:39:13.276 --> 00:39:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can see at the end, she
will do a reading in the water,

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.670 align:middle line:84%
which is sort of like an oracle,
about how each person is,

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.604 align:middle line:90%
how each baby is.

00:39:21.604 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:84%
We have the sacred plants,
the medicinal plants.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Just like we have each
one of us a specific gift,

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.510 align:middle line:84%
whether it is in our
knowledge, whether it

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.670 align:middle line:84%
is in our activities, whether
it's in something we do.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Same way plants also have
a specific gift for us.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And for centuries, our ancestors
have been working with them,

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and have been using
them for healing

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:90%
in various different ways.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:84%
One thing I have learned
about medicinal plants

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:84%
from my grandmother is that
there's a whole family of them.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:84%
You must recognize the
grandmother plants,

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:84%
the grandfather plants, the
parents, and the children,

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and the grandchildren.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, the ancestral
plans or the elder plants

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:18.250 align:middle line:84%
would be like Wachuma as
they know it as San Pedro

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:90%
or Ayahusca, or [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
All these master
plants that we used

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:31.220 align:middle line:84%
only in a very sacred way
for the deepest awakening.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And the other
plants, the parents,

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:37.110 align:middle line:84%
would be the ones that
are important if you

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.170 align:middle line:84%
have infections, if
you have inflammation.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But you also use
them internally.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And some of the younger
plants are the ones

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.700 align:middle line:90%
that you use externally.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Instead of an antibiotic, you
could use some of these plants.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And the other medicine
are new plants.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.020 align:middle line:84%
New plants, the children
plants, are the ones

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that you could use them in tea
every day if it's good for you.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Or you could use them in baths.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You could put them
in the specific pots

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and bathe with them.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:84%
These plans are at the level
that they give themselves

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
completely in service
for our well being,

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.940 align:middle line:84%
for our being balanced and
for our being in good health,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and for us being
in life connected

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and grounded and happy.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So that is why medicinal
plants are a very important

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.555 align:middle line:90%
part of our healing also.

PAM: And the reason
for doing this is--

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.018 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to
feel cold after the bathe.

00:41:54.018 --> 00:41:55.946 align:middle line:84%

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:04.215 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the bath that
you just had also

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.910 align:middle line:90%
is very good for your ankles.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Because when you hurt them,
your cells had a trauma.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So all of that gets cleared away
with these medicinal plants.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only for
the physical part.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
It is also for the
energetic, for the spiritual,

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:84%
for the emotional, for
the psychological part.

taken is the correct path.

with a man I thought
I would grow old with,

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.396 align:middle line:84%
and a home that I
thought would be my last.

00:43:06.396 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I left my friends,
my family, my career.

Behind here, we
have Machu Picchu.

We believe that is
perhaps one of the origins

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.210 align:middle line:10%
of the name for Machu Picchu.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu, as they
say, is to Quechua

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:90%
words which means old mountain.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps more than that, it
actually means the old bird.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Machu Picchu.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Wherever our ancestors
had found sacred temples,

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.260 align:middle line:84%
there had to be
two mountaintops.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the mountaintops
is wayna picchu,

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
which is young mountain,
and machu picchu,

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:20.650 align:middle line:90%
which is the old mountain.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So in one mountain range, if
they could find two peaks,

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that was for them
a sacred symbol.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Also, it is believed
that Machu Picchu

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.980 align:middle line:84%
was built as a sacred
altar for Salkantay.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And Apus Salkantay is a mountain
spirit that is perhaps the most

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.440 align:middle line:90%
important in this region.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It is hardly accessible,
and in the spiritual sense,

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.120 align:middle line:84%
every medicine man
and medicine woman

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.920 align:middle line:84%
had to journey to
this mountain in order

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to be initiated, in
order to be enlightened.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have tried to arrive

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:84%
to the summit of this
mountain, and many people

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.320 align:middle line:90%
even haven't returned.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that this
mountain is protected.

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call it salka,
which means wild mountain.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And a way for our ancestors to
arrive to its actual essence

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.380 align:middle line:84%
of what this
mountain represented

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.510 align:middle line:84%
was for them journeying
to Machu Picchu.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Because they would take a trail,
what we call an Inca trail,

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:middle line:84%
for journeying for a long
time, preparing themselves

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.060 align:middle line:84%
in these specific places,
and arriving into Machu

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Picchu in pilgrimage.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps this
place was also kept

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:45.440 align:middle line:84%
in secret because
of that, because

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.630 align:middle line:90%
of being an altar to Salkantay.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Also the belief is
that in this place,

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.910 align:middle line:84%
why the Spaniards
never found it,

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:02.250 align:middle line:84%
not only because the Incas left
it burned, but also because it

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:84%
was built in a strategic
point in the mountains

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:84%
where it is almost part
of the mountain range.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can only
find it if you're

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.980 align:middle line:84%
coming through the
top of the mountains

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.680 align:middle line:84%
like we are now on
the top of a mountain.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you are down in the
valley near the river,

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:24.200 align:middle line:84%
it is almost impossible
that you could

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.940 align:middle line:84%
have found it even
if you knew that it

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.390 align:middle line:90%
was going to be around here.

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:10%
So the reason why
that was also is

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:38.760 align:middle line:10%
because it gives you the
feeling that you are a condor.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.370 align:middle line:84%
That is why you are always
at the top of the mountain.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.810 align:middle line:84%
That is why you
are always up high.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And in sometimes of the year,
filled with mist and clouds,

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
so it's almost like you're
always in the heavens.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And in Machu Picchu, the
medicine for this time,

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.680 align:middle line:90%
for this area is feminine.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that is why they
found a priestess mummy that

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.300 align:middle line:84%
was the most important person in
Machu Picchu, and was a woman.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:18.590 align:middle line:84%
They found her with all the
ceremonial regalia and the pots

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and instruments for rituals.

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:27.200 align:middle line:10%
And so we believe, in
the spiritual sense,

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:10%
that Machu Picchu was the
sacred temple of the Amazonas

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:10%
warriors, which
were women that were

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:38.460 align:middle line:10%
initiated at the age of 13 as
chosen princesses of the sun.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were trained
physically, spiritually,

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally to be the
leaders, to be the healers,

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to be the governors, to be the
warriors for the whole Inca

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:51.930 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And here in Machu
Picchu was the place

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.750 align:middle line:84%
where they used to be born,
where they used to be trained,

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.690 align:middle line:90%
where they used to be initiated.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.980 align:middle line:84%
The Amazonas
warriors, which were

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.530 align:middle line:90%
like the CIA of the Inca times.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.290 align:middle line:84%
These people were highly
trained in all levels.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.270 align:middle line:84%
They could put you to sleep
just with their thought

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.660 align:middle line:90%
is what the legends say.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.610 align:middle line:84%
These people were hatun
munanio, as we call.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And hatun means big, and
munanio means big love.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So these people had a
big, big, big, heart.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:27.090 align:middle line:84%
If anything they developed
very well was their love.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And their love for our planet,
their love for their path,

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:38.000 align:middle line:84%
for the spiritual journey they
had, for the Inca civilization,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.480 align:middle line:90%
for the father son.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they were like
warriors who would not only

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:46.680 align:middle line:84%
protect the
civilization, but also

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.110 align:middle line:84%
be the leaders and the
guardians and the witnesses

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.790 align:middle line:84%
of life unfolding
every thousandth

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of a second in their lives.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Highly powerful princesses.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And also perhaps we can
say, because of the condor,

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.280 align:middle line:84%
some people arrived
to Machu Picchu

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.120 align:middle line:90%
to leave their physical bodies.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.890 align:middle line:84%
When they were elders, they
would journey for many years

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:12.975 align:middle line:84%
to this place, and
they would arrive here.

00:49:12.975 --> 00:49:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And with the help of
perhaps sacred plants

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.880 align:middle line:84%
or some transcending
meditation, they would

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:90%
leave their physical body.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And they would be
afterwards mummified.

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were first
placed in a condor altar

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:34.290 align:middle line:84%
here in Machu Picchu that
is in a flying position.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:36.920 align:middle line:90%
And it is facing east.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:84%
The two meanings that
this condor temple has

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.380 align:middle line:84%
is that our ancestors could
be coming from the west

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and arriving and bringing all
the wisdom and all the strength

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.380 align:middle line:90%
for life to continue.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:84%
All the sacred knowledges,
all the sacred formulas

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.330 align:middle line:84%
for architecture, engineering,
and the administration.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And the other meaning would
be as it's flying to the east,

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.300 align:middle line:84%
taking all these
beings that have

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.560 align:middle line:90%
been mummified to the light.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors used to
come to these terraces,

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and in ceremony they would
receive the first light,

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.090 align:middle line:90%
the first rays of the sun.

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And the sun for our
ancestors represented

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:28.620 align:middle line:84%
the physical manifestation
of the father of God.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And now they are
the only beings that

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:36.920 align:middle line:84%
receive in ceremony the sun
is the llamas that live here.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And these sacred cameloids for
us represents service of love.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So for those of us who
will recognize our symbols

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and our sacred
ancient teachings,

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.180 align:middle line:84%
we would realize that whatever
we see these beings receiving

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:56.880 align:middle line:84%
the sun in this way, we are
reminded that this day is a day

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.250 align:middle line:84%
to serve, that this
day is a day to be

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:05.260 align:middle line:84%
in absolute and
unconditional service of love

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:10.070 align:middle line:84%
to all our family,
to all our community.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Grandfather wold
always say, when

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.860 align:middle line:84%
you're in the sacred temples,
how would you rather be?

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Would you rather be
conscious of the energy?

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Would you rather be conscious
of everything that is happening?

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Or would you like
to be unconscious?

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
conscious, grandfather.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:30.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.160 align:middle line:90%
He would say, oh, boy.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.620 align:middle line:90%
You continue limiting yourself.

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are conscious,
your mind is in charge,

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and your mind wants to
make sense of everything.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.365 align:middle line:84%
Wants to understand
it, wants to limit

00:51:46.365 --> 00:51:49.540 align:middle line:90%
it in your complete experience.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And he would tell
me that when you

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.750 align:middle line:84%
are unconscious
through it all, you are

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.230 align:middle line:90%
completely receiving the magic.

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
unconscious level,

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.000 align:middle line:90%
all the magic is happening.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And your mind, instead
of making sense,

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.460 align:middle line:90%
in loses sense of it all.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you are
completely open to receive

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:17.050 align:middle line:84%
all the energy,
all the magic, all

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:20.300 align:middle line:90%
the healing that can happen.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.170 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
our mountain spirits,

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:26.110 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about
God, transcends

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:31.430 align:middle line:90%
gender really, and ourselves.

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:36.040 align:middle line:10%
In essence, we are
not a man or a woman.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Our soul, our spirit
transcends that.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Though we are coming into
this physical temple,

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:84%
we are coming into this
sacred planet as a man

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.220 align:middle line:90%
or a woman for a reason.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we need to
consider ourselves, our bodies,

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.920 align:middle line:90%
as sacred temples.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.420 align:middle line:10%
And oftentimes in
most places I have

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.850 align:middle line:10%
heard the weak gender
or the weak sex

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:05.690 align:middle line:10%
when they are
speaking of a woman.

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
I ask them is, well,

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.500 align:middle line:84%
talking about a weak sex or
talking about a weak gender,

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.380 align:middle line:90%
how does a woman give birth?

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Just that even.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:23.740 align:middle line:10%
And as a man, would we be able
to support so much pain and so

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:30.830 align:middle line:10%
much suffering to the point
that a woman can give her life

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.240 align:middle line:10%
for the life of another child?

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.650 align:middle line:10%
And that is the offering
of Mother Earth.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:42.430 align:middle line:10%
That is perhaps why when we
talk about pachamama here,

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:48.080 align:middle line:10%
when a girl is born, the
moment she is a girl at birth,

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.340 align:middle line:10%
she represents Mother Earth.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, all women
represent pachamama.

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's how sacred
you are as women.

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:02.350 align:middle line:10%
And in our traditions,
there had to be

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:05.590 align:middle line:10%
a delicate and a
specific care for all

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.440 align:middle line:10%
the girls that were growing.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.900 align:middle line:10%
For example, one of the
teachings that I remember

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:17.980 align:middle line:10%
in our communities is that
when a girl starts being 13,

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:24.270 align:middle line:10%
they tell her, when you are
in love, be very delicate

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:28.430 align:middle line:10%
and be very careful when
you're offering yourself

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.890 align:middle line:10%
to another being,
to another person,

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.300 align:middle line:10%
especially if you're
thinking that that person is

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.680 align:middle line:10%
going to be your husband.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Because he's not going to
grow from your shoulder,

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:41.930 align:middle line:90%
they would say.

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:48.260 align:middle line:84%
He will either die or
leave with another woman.

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.460 align:middle line:84%
That is what they tell the
girls in the communities.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of girls are
already being trained that

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.520 align:middle line:84%
life is about
non-attachment, that

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.950 align:middle line:90%
you cannot take for granted.

00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And especially in love, which
is where most of the time we get

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.420 align:middle line:90%
hurt.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that is
one of the teachings

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.310 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
have left to us.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:14.022 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever we
have attachments,

00:55:14.022 --> 00:55:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that is where we get
hit first or most

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:24.700 align:middle line:84%
when the waves of the energy
of hurt and destruction come.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.710 align:middle line:84%
They hit us first
in our attachments.

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:33.050 align:middle line:10%
But when a being is prepared,
when a person is being already

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:38.450 align:middle line:10%
trained from very early
time, from childhood,

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:10%
that life is not to
take for granted,

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.710 align:middle line:10%
that love is not to
take for granted.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:47.160 align:middle line:90%
So we can't have attachments.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize that
true love liberates you,

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:59.838 align:middle line:84%
is about liberation and
not about possession,

00:55:59.838 --> 00:56:03.775 align:middle line:84%
then really there's more
harmony and there's more peace.

00:56:03.775 --> 00:56:09.060 align:middle line:10%
Here in the Andes we
have this philosophy

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.040 align:middle line:10%
of the yanantin-masantin.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Yanantin is a connection,
is a unity of two

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:20.970 align:middle line:90%
beings that can be together.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And it can be of
the same gender,

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.000 align:middle line:90%
it can be of opposite genders.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.300 align:middle line:10%
It is not necessarily
a relationship of love.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it
transcends even that.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:39.950 align:middle line:10%
It is a relationship of two
beings who want to be together,

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:44.310 align:middle line:10%
a sacred power that
together only they

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:48.250 align:middle line:10%
can be of great service,
great, great service.

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.230 align:middle line:10%
They become allies.

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:54.420 align:middle line:10%
They become a team that
can be inseparable.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.820 align:middle line:84%
That yanantin is very,
very powerful to the point

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:01.600 align:middle line:84%
that in the Andes,
it was considered

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:07.590 align:middle line:84%
as something more powerful even
than a relationship of love

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.820 align:middle line:90%
or of partners.

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the masantin,
yanantin-masantin

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:16.410 align:middle line:84%
was only applied to
couples, to partners

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.390 align:middle line:84%
who would choose
to walk together

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:21.040 align:middle line:90%
in life and in their path.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And it had to be
specifically of a woman

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:28.300 align:middle line:90%
and a man in yanantin-masantin.

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Because of the polarity.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.700 align:middle line:84%
There had to be
the sacred balance.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Every medicine man,
every paco, have

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:39.260 align:middle line:84%
to have its yanantin-masantin in
order to be in complete harmony

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and in complete
balance in the cosmos.

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:44.380 align:middle line:90%


00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.950 align:middle line:84%
PAM: To know that the
leaders of this sacred land

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:52.456 align:middle line:84%
were all powerful women
gave me newfound strength.

00:57:52.456 --> 00:57:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder, if,
as a human race

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.870 align:middle line:84%
we are headed towards a major
calamity in the next few years,

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:04.940 align:middle line:84%
is there any way we can change
course and save our planet?

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the process,
ourselves and our families?

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Puma introduced me to the
prophecy of the condor

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and the eagle flying
together, a prophecy that

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:18.430 align:middle line:90%
is literally written in stone.

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:20.970 align:middle line:10%
PUMA: There's a whole
oracle of the secret trilogy

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.670 align:middle line:10%
in this altar.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:25.940 align:middle line:10%
There's a whole oracle for
the people of the north

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.220 align:middle line:10%
and the people of the south.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole oracle
for the eagle people

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.240 align:middle line:90%
and the condor people.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.350 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
these two birds,

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:38.240 align:middle line:84%
there is a very, very strong
difference between these two.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Here is the tails of both.

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:45.010 align:middle line:84%
The wings of this one
is coming forwards,

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and this one is
coming backwards.

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Two different birds.

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:55.505 align:middle line:84%
The condor in the Andes, when it
flies, it flies as if hugging.

00:58:55.505 --> 00:58:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
wings sort of forwards.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And the eagle, because
it's a hunting bird,

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:07.520 align:middle line:84%
it has the wings
backwards like this.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is a condor,
this is an eagle.

00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So the prophecy of the condor
and the eagle flying together

00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:17.760 align:middle line:90%
is not so much a prophecy.

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.310 align:middle line:84%
For us, it is an
eternal reality.

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:23.050 align:middle line:84%
People of the north and the
south in the spiritual level

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:24.560 align:middle line:90%
are always connected.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We're always connected, and
will always be connected.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:31.950 align:middle line:84%
As people, as humans,
the condor people,

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:33.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning the people of
the southern hemisphere,

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.600 align:middle line:84%
is this puma,
represented by this puma.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The puma represents the power
of love, the power of will,

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.100 align:middle line:90%
the power of the heart.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.930 align:middle line:84%
This puma has the
tail straight up.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:middle line:84%
The tail of the puma in
the Andean cosmic vision

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:51.230 align:middle line:84%
represents all of
its personality.

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So if it has a tail straight
up, it's in a warrior position.

00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And the back legs are over here.

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The front legs are
hugging Mother Earth,

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and the head here
kissing, like giving

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.580 align:middle line:90%
the breath to Mother Earth.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that the people of the
south, people of the Andes,

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:16.030 align:middle line:84%
our main actions are focused on
pachamama, on our Mother Earth.

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:20.240 align:middle line:84%
All our ceremonies, all our
philosophy, all our traditions,

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
all our actions
every day are focused

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.610 align:middle line:90%
on pachamama, Mother Earth.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And we are the guardians
and the stewards

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.830 align:middle line:84%
of all of these ancient
traditions for a reason.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.195 align:middle line:84%
That is why a lot of
the messages, a lot

01:00:37.195 --> 01:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred knowledge
of the ancient ones

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.930 align:middle line:84%
is yet to be revealed
to the world.

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:46.650 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it was kept in secret.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The people of the north,
of the northern hemisphere,

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:52.980 align:middle line:90%
is this puma.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.290 align:middle line:90%
It's sleeping.

01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Here's the back legs.

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.370 align:middle line:90%
The front legs are crossed.

01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Here's the tail.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Tail around pachamama
means control,

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:06.070 align:middle line:84%
taking all the resources,
taking everything.

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:07.990 align:middle line:90%
That is the people of the north.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It involves all the northern
countries across the equator

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.850 align:middle line:90%
from the northern hemisphere.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And the southern puma involves
all the southern countries

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:24.800 align:middle line:90%
below the equator.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So what is most interesting in
geology is that our Andes being

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
tall mountains are very
young, very, very young

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
mountains compared to the
Appalachians, to the Rockies,

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to the mountain
ranges in the north.

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:49.255 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, these two
pumas have a difference.

01:01:49.255 --> 01:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
That one is a young puma,
the puma of the south.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
This could be the
father or the mother.

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Because at this level,
they transcend gender.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.620 align:middle line:84%
When this puma wakes up, being
the mother or the father,

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
has the power to bring
change to the world.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
That is what we see,
that is what we know,

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and that is what
our ancestors have

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
left as a very clear
message for these times,

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:18.470 align:middle line:90%
for these generations.

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
From pachamama comes
out the serpent,

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the sacred
consciousness, the sacred

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
psychological and emotional
temple of our ancestors.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
These are the serpent,
meaning all our philosophies,

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
all our practices, all
our ceremonies are just

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:36.100 align:middle line:90%
coming out of Mother Earth.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from pachamama,
meaning all our wisdom

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:42.340 align:middle line:90%
is rooted in Mother Earth.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Where the serpent of the
north is coming from where?

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Around here.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's meeting in
this point, two of them.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Where is the connection to
Mother Earth in the north?

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that is why in
the north you always

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
connect to great spirit,
to all our relations,

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.580 align:middle line:84%
because your connection
is with the sky.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.816 align:middle line:84%
And here in the south, our
connection is with pachamama,

01:03:09.816 --> 01:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Earth.

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
That is to be the balance,
that is to be the polarity.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:19.185 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this representing
the psychological

01:03:19.185 --> 01:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
temple of our being,

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness, this serpent
of the north is also bigger

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and the serpent of
the south is smaller.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.570 align:middle line:90%


01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:33.610 align:middle line:90%
It is not coincidence.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:39.270 align:middle line:84%
This one has a very
harmonious curve.

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.980 align:middle line:90%
See?

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Very strong.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.270 align:middle line:90%
This one has a sharp turn.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:45.810 align:middle line:90%


01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:47.020 align:middle line:90%
You see?

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I think this one is pushing
it, which means arrogance.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
arrogance in the north.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the message
that need to go now.

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Here in the south, where
people can recognize

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to be that Puma, where they
can reclaim their own power

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and be the guardians
and stewards

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:11.130 align:middle line:90%
of this sacred pachamama.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Where people in the north can
recognize to be this puma,

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that they are
sleeping and that they need to

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:18.740 align:middle line:90%
wake up.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the oracle of
a condor and an eagle.

01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:26.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the oracle for
humanity for these times.

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And the message
is very powerful.

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Puma, you keep saying
that we need to wake up.

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.750 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:38.480 align:middle line:90%
You are the puma.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Waking up represents recognizing
completely who you are,

01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
that there's a deeper
Pamela inside you

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.268 align:middle line:90%
that needs to wake up.

01:04:50.268 --> 01:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
That who you are right
now is who you are,

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:55.020 align:middle line:90%
but there's deeper inside, more.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%


01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, to know that there's
a puma sleeping inside you,

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that your complete power
of will to change weathers,

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
to change your
directions, to change

01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
the reality of your
family, to change

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
the reality of your
community, to change

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
the reality of Mother
Earth, that power of will

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.560 align:middle line:90%
is sleeping in you.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
That is what it means when
that puma is sleeping.

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you see,
the US or Canada,

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:30.890 align:middle line:90%
for example, has the power.

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
You have the power
because of the technology.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You have because of
the resources you have,

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:38.430 align:middle line:84%
because of the financial
possibly you have

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.940 align:middle line:90%
to bring change to the world.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
You're just not doing it because
that will is not woken up yet.

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Once that love, once that
will is completely awake,

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
nothing will be
able to stop that.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.325 align:middle line:90%
It is in the cosmic flow.

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:58.080 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
PAM: Puma remarked
that my injury was

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.896 align:middle line:90%
part of my spiritual healing.

01:06:02.896 --> 01:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
after 10 days,

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
my foot and ankle were
completely healed,

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and I felt lighter.

01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as arrived
back in the States,

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
the pain in my foot
and ankle returned.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.194 align:middle line:84%
So I sought the advice
of a medical doctor.

01:06:20.194 --> 01:06:27.510 align:middle line:90%


01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:29.610 align:middle line:90%
I think he thought I was nuts.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Your ankle's fine.

01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:33.280 align:middle line:10%
So what do you want from me?

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.850 align:middle line:10%
When I was in Peru, what I
thought was a simple ankle

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:40.210 align:middle line:10%
sprain, a local shaman
who worked on me

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:42.390 align:middle line:10%
said it was more serious.

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
from the translation,

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:49.470 align:middle line:84%
it was either I-- the
ligaments or the nerves

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
in my-- had just
separated from the bone.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So he pushed the
nerves back into place,

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.536 align:middle line:84%
and then he wrapped my ankle
and foot in a herbal cast,

01:06:59.536 --> 01:07:01.835 align:middle line:84%
uh, I guess to control
the swelling and pain.

01:07:01.835 --> 01:07:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But which it actually did,
because I was able to hike

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Machu Picchu three days later.

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And, um, was it--
by the seventh day,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I was actually able to
put weight on my foot

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and with no pain.

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But when I arrived back
in the United States,

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:middle line:90%
the pain returned and increased.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, from what
you told me, maybe

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
your quick recovery
was from getting

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.542 align:middle line:90%
immediate medical attention.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:26.928 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:07:26.928 --> 01:07:28.550 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not true.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You see, after the
initial injury,

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I ended up hiking four miles
up a mountain, four miles down

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
a mountain, and
another three miles

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
into town before
my leg gave out.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, all I can
say is, nice sprain.

01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:44.237 align:middle line:84%
Lose the crutches
when you can and bear

01:07:44.237 --> 01:07:45.270 align:middle line:90%
weight as you feel comfortable.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.686 align:middle line:90%


01:07:48.686 --> 01:07:51.190 align:middle line:90%
PAM: I was intrigued.

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:54.520 align:middle line:84%
As quickly as the
questions arose in my mind,

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.915 align:middle line:84%
just as Puma told me,
people and teachers

01:07:57.915 --> 01:07:59.124 align:middle line:90%
began entering my life.

01:07:59.124 --> 01:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%


01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I traveled to Mexico and
met healer Maria Teresa

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Valenzuela who had studied with
the experts from NASA's Hubble.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.970 align:middle line:10%
After giving a scientific-based
analogy of what to expect

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:26.420 align:middle line:10%
in 2012, merging the indigenous
teachings with science,

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.319 align:middle line:10%
Maria offered a bit of
advice as to what each of us

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:34.439 align:middle line:10%
can do in preparation for
these upcoming changes.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:40.310 align:middle line:84%
We're under this deep, deep
hypnosis for whatever reason.

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:43.160 align:middle line:90%
But to me, we need to wake up.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.500 align:middle line:90%
We're running out of time.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.910 align:middle line:90%
We need to simplify our lives.

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
We need to really let
go of a lot of the stuff

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that we run every
weekend to the malls,

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
we run to the
supermarkets to buy

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
things that sit on the
shelves and collect dust.

01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people that have
these closets full of food

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.450 align:middle line:90%
that they never use.

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We need to let go of our
attachments, things that

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.950 align:middle line:90%
just don't serve us anymore.

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
We as human beings need
tremendous healings

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.060 align:middle line:90%
from our addictions.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And our addiction's in
many, many, many forms.

01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I can go to alcohol,
drugs, the television,

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.580 align:middle line:90%
our addictions of privilege.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.314 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

01:09:29.314 --> 01:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, the sense of
privilege that we're more

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:33.970 align:middle line:90%
dominant than the other one.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Our addictions of our
emotions, of our angers.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:39.779 align:middle line:84%
They need to get rid
of their credit cards.

01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
By growing your own
gardens, learning

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
to walk lighter in
life, you will not need

01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:48.680 align:middle line:90%
this dense card, this density.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.080 align:middle line:90%
So I ask, get rid of them.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Pay up your debts.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.819 align:middle line:84%
They need to come
into communities.

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, working in communities
is very important.

01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of people that are
very, very lonely in cities.

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:02.300 align:middle line:90%
They live by themselves.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So I ask, have you
ever thought of maybe

01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
finding an empty apartment
house in a group of your friends

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that you really like,
do, like, co-housing?

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And then also, like, if
people live in neighborhoods

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that maybe once a week they
come together as a community

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and they work as a community.

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:26.630 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
gardens come in.

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that is
very important in these times

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
is that you need to take
care of your bodies.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
As you know, everything
is more polluted.

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And as we move a little bit
forward in these coming years,

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
it is said that
everything is going

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to get even more polluted,
and that more death is coming.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So that each of us needs to
exercise more, eat better,

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.810 align:middle line:90%
do more walking.

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can leave you
with this message

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:56.220 align:middle line:90%
that I truly, truly do believe.

01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:01.280 align:middle line:84%
That there's no reason
to fear the future,

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.450 align:middle line:90%
because we come from the future.

01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:06.020 align:middle line:90%
We come from the stars.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So there is no
reason to fear it.

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
There's wonderful
possibilities up there.

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:15.500 align:middle line:10%
PAM: I learned about kinesiology
from Sonny Molina, a shaman

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.120 align:middle line:10%
I met who practices sports
medicine at the Sanada

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.600 align:middle line:10%
Clinic in San Antonio, Texas.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
He taught me how your body
can talk to you, giving

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
you the answers to
all your questions,

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:27.690 align:middle line:90%
whether simple or abstract.

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:31.030 align:middle line:90%


01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
This was all now
beginning to make sense.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I started making
changes in my own mind.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I joined a neighborhood
garden club.

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I started growing
my own vegetables.

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I actually know the
names of my neighbors.

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I excitedly shared by newfound
knowledge with my daughter.

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And with each new
piece of information,

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
she began to apply these
tools to her own life.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.130 align:middle line:10%
Soon after, she got
a good paying job

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:04.060 align:middle line:10%
and moved into an
apartment with the kids,

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:07.350 align:middle line:10%
their first real apartment.

01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:08.640 align:middle line:90%
And then the challenges began.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.700 align:middle line:90%


01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Robert, Ariana's estranged mate,
had been released from prison.

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Despite a restraining
order, he continued

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:21.730 align:middle line:90%
to stalk Ariana and the kids.
