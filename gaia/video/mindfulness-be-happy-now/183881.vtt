>> When you drink your tea,
you may like to bring your mind

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
back to your body, so that
you'll be completely there,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
established in the
present moment.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you drink
like that, you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
drink not only with your
body, but you drink and so

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:90%
with your mind.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
You drink the tea, and
you are aware that you

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:90%
are drinking the tea.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
That is mindfulness
of drinking, you see?

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you're drinking
your tea with mindfulness,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:90%
you are really there.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:90%
And the tea is clearly there.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
there's true life.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:84%
If your mind is elsewhere, you
are not entirely with your tea.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:90%
You are not there in soul.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So that the act of
drinking tea is not life.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
You'll behave-- you operate
like a robot and machine.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is not there.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Mindful means you
are full of mind.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you breathe
in and if you

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:84%
know that you are breathing
in, that is mindful breathing.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe
mindfully, your mind

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
is back to your body,
mind-body together.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.210 align:middle line:84%
You are truly there
in the here and now.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:90%
You are fully alive.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:90%
You are fully present.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness make you
fully alive, fully present.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness is
the kind of energy

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to be
in the here and now,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
so that you can get in touch
with the wonders of life that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:90%
are in you and around you.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get in touch
with these wonders of life that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
are refreshing,
healing, nourishing,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and you get the
nourishment from it,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
you'll get the
healing that you need.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness, first
of all, is the capacity

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
to be truly there in the
here and now in order

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
for you to get in touch
with the wonders of life,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
truly live your life.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.745 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
back to yourself,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
you might encounter
something that

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is negative, like your
sorrow or your fear, anger.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And mindfulness help you
to have an opportunity

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to take care of your
fear, your anger.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The energy of
mindfulness may help

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
you to recognize the
presence of your fear,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:90%
your anger, your depression.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The energy of
mindfulness generated

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
by your mindful breathing can
help you to embrace tenderly

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
the fear, the sorrow
that is in you, so

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:90%
that you may get a relief.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness can also help
you to take care of yourself

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:84%
when you need to take care
when you go back to yourself.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you encounter
the positive things

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and then you can be
nourished and heal

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
by these positive things,
when mindfulness bring

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
your mind back to your body and
if you encounter some tensions,

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
some pain, some sorrow,
then mindfulness

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
will help recognize, embrace
tenderly, these emotions,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
these feelings, these pains
so that you will suffer less.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And mindfulness, if
you practice regularly,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
will be stronger every day and
will bring more concentration.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And with mindfulness
and concentration,

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you can look deeply
at what is there

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and you can understand
deeply the nature

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of what is there, maybe
your anger, your fear.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to look
deeply into the nature

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
of your fear, your anger,
you will get the insight

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:90%
into their nature.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of insight
will liberate you from harm

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:90%
from your fear, your anger.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness bring
concentration and mindfulness

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and concentration bring
insight that is liberating.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Mindfulness is conscious,
curious, unattached,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.155 align:middle line:90%
nonjudgmental awareness.

00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
It could be awareness of what's
happening in the outside world.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be awareness of
what's happening in your body.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It could be awareness
of your thoughts.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It could be awareness of
images and consciousness.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It could be awareness
of emotions.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So when you observe without
judgment, that's mindfulness,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:90%
and it's very profound.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest form
of human intelligence.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Because in the mirror
observing of yourself, because

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
in that sense, you're observing
you, your perceptions,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts, your
sensations, your images.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So the highest form
of human intelligence

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
observe yourself

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:90%
without judging yourself.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And in the mirror, observation
of yourself without judgment

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
is transformation insight,
intuition, creativity,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
imagination, healing,
self-repair, self-organization,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
homeostasis, the tying in
of your biological rhythms

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
to the rhythms of the universe,
which we call circadian

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:90%
rhythms and seasonal rhythms.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:90%
It's healing, basically.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.785 align:middle line:90%
It's your essential state.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:90%
You're a human being.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:90%
You're not a human doing.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the idea
of just noticing,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
just noticing in
the present moment,

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
without putting words to the
experience and just noticing.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
describing practice,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:84%
which is just to put words
on what the experience is.

if you bring your mind,

your mind stop all thinking,
whether of the past,

of the future, of your projects.

Your mind is focusing
only on your in breathe.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Stopping the thinking help you.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:90%
You become your in breath.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
You are concentrated
on your breath.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe out,
you focus your attention

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:90%
on your out breath.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:90%
You stop the thinking.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:90%
You are only in breath.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The only object of
your mind is your

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:90%
in breath and your out breath.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:84%
You are concentrated on your
in breath, on your out breath.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you continue to breathe
like that for a few moments,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the quality of your in
breath and out breath

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.610 align:middle line:90%
will be improved.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Your in breath and
out breath have

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
become slower, more
peaceful, more harmonious,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:90%
and you'll feel better.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a peace now, more
peace now in your breathing.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And as your breathing
has become more peaceful,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:90%
your body will profit from it.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
There may be a lot of tension
and pain in your body,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
but if your breath
has become peaceful,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
your body will
become more peaceful.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And I would propose that when
we go back to our body, now

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
you should recognize
our body as existing.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And you may realize
that there is

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:90%
tension and pain in our body.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So I propose the
exercise breathing in,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I am aware of my whole body.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Breathing out, I release
the tension in my body.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So to go back to your
body to recognize

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
the presence of your body
is a kind of reconciliation

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:84%
because you may have not
taken good care of your body.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
You may have worked
your body to hard,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and you have allowed
tension and pain

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
to be accumulated
into your body.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the mind
going home to the body and

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
allowed the body to
release the tension.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That's very nice.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
That is a practice of
reconciliation with the body,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
helping the body to
release the tension.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
When you have some
peace in your breathing,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that peace will be
extended to your body.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And then if you have feelings
that are painful emotions,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
your mindfulness can help
recognize these emotions,

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:84%
these painful feelings,
hold them dearly, tenderly,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:90%
and help you to get relief.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, you bring
your mind back to your body

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and take care of your body.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And your body will have
more peace, more relaxation,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and then you are in
a position to take

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
care of your feelings
and your emotions.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%
There are pleasant feeling.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:90%
There are painful feeling.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
There are strong emotions
that make you suffer,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
so mindfulness is
the kind of energy

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
that can also recognize
a feeling and emotion

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and also help embrace
tenderly that feeling,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that emotion so that
you can get a relief.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you are a
good practitioner,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
if you continue your practice
of mindful breathing, mindful

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:84%
holding, then you
can look deeply

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
into the roots of your
feeling, of your emotion

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and find out the reasons,
the causes that have

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:90%
brought that feeling to you.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of looking
deeply is called meditation.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It identifies
sources of suffering.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And once you have identified
the roots of your being,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
you can get the
liberation that you need.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like when your doctor
has identified your sickness,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and then he can
propose you to use

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
the kind of medicine,
the kind of life that

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:90%
can help end the sickness.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness and concentration
helped bring a relief,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
help you to understand deep
root to your suffering,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
help you to see the path
leading to the healing,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:90%
the transformation.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, mindfulness heals
because in mindfulness,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:90%
there's equanimity.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And when there is
equanimity, then you're

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:90%
sustained in that equanimity.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:84%
There's joy, and when
there's joy and equanimity,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
there's the birth in
that of compassion.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things
actually cause your body

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to go to its
essential state, which

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
we call in medicine--
we call it homeostasis,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:90%
which is self-regulation.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
In our society, people
are doing, doing, doing,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:90%
and it's mostly mindless doing.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course,
they're thinking a lot,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's mostly
about themselves.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
There's no creative
thinking, other

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:90%
than in the creative fields.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But even that is mostly what
I call simulated creativity.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not real creativity.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.122 align:middle line:84%
There's very little feeling,
and there's no being.

00:13:44.122 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And mindfulness reverses the
whole thing spontaneously.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're mindful, you're
in the state of being.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
the state of being,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:84%
it spontaneously awakens
love and compassion.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you're there,
then it spontaneously

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:84%
unfolds into creativity, and
then you do the right thing.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Breathe your life.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It means nothing, and
it means everything.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It depends on our state of mind
because as my brother shared

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:90%
earlier, all of us, we breathe.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
In the womb, mother breathed
for us, and the moment

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:84%
that we are born
and we start to cry,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.775 align:middle line:90%
that's our first in breath.

00:14:29.775 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And so however old
we are right now,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:90%
we have breathed all our lives.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But for most of us,
it means nothing

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:90%
because we're not aware of it.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a breathing
center in the brain that

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
takes care of it, and so we
do not have to think about it.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:84%
We do not have to
be aware of it.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It's done automatically,
and so that's the life

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.560 align:middle line:90%
that we have also continues.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It can continue automatically
because the body

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
has an amazing capacity
to take care of itself,

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
to regulate itself.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so breathe is something
can be very automatic

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and to be alive can be--
there is something also

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
very automatic for
our whole lives.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But a person who
learns to be aware

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that he or she is breathing,
then it changes everything.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And a person who learns
that he or she is alive,

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:84%
it really changes everything,
the health, the mental health,

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:90%
and also the physical health.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, the awareness of
the body, which is the breath--

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:90%
we start with the breath.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We learn to be aware
of that, and we

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:84%
learn to touch the changes
in the breath, the changes

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:90%
in the breathing patterns.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And through that, we learn
to be more aware of our body.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Right now, some of us are
quite relaxed and some of us

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.873 align:middle line:90%
are less relaxed.

00:16:08.873 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
But if we are aware
of our breathing,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
we will be more aware of whether
we are relaxed or less relaxed.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So we are in touch
with the body.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
aware of our breath,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
also we are aware of our mind
because when we have anger,

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:90%
we breathe differently.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:84%
When we have sadness, worries,
we breathe differently.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So what do we learn to be
aware, more and more aware

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
of the patterns of our
breathing and abrupt changes

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
in every moment,
then we learn to be

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.320 align:middle line:84%
aware of what's going
on in our mind, what's

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
going on in our thoughts
and perceptions that

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
causes that change
that breathing pattern.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes life very
dynamic, very lively.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually think that
mindfulness should be

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the centerpiece of psychiatric
treatment because in the West,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
we are so
scientifically oriented.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So if we put mindfulness
to rigorous scientific

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:84%
experimentation,
we find that it has

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
ways of working with the
mind that calm the mind.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
in today's world,

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
where everything is a
disorder-- we're pathologizing

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:90%
everything--

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that mindfulness has a core
and central role in healing.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.785 align:middle line:90%
[MEDITATION CHIME]

00:17:34.785 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are mindful,
if you are truly there,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.254 align:middle line:84%
you are truly there in
the here and the now.

00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:90%
You are concentrating.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And drinking your
tea in mindfulness

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:90%
is a spirituality already.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:90%
So when you look at one person--

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:84%
if you are truly aware that
he is there, she is there--

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
in that person,
there is suffering.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:90%
There is the need to transform.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
look at him or her

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
with compassion and
understanding like that,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:90%
that is spirituality already.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you take a step,
and if you are aware

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
that you are making
this step, that you

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
are walk, that you touch the
earth with your foot mindfully,

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and that is a
spiritual act also.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.090 align:middle line:90%
There is a gatha--

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
placing your foot on the
ground is to perform a miracle.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Every mindful step
help reveal to you

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
the Kingdom of God, the
pure land of the Buddha.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So walking with
mindfulness can help

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
you touch all the
wonders of life that

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
are available in
the here and now,

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's very
nourishing and healing.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of us walk
like sleepwalkers.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:90%
We don't enjoy our steps.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is elsewhere in
our projects, in the future.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So you don't get the
healing, the transformation.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't touch
the Kingdom of God,

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
with all the wonders, the
blue sky, the flowers that

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
are blooming, the
green hills, children

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
who are playing around you.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
They all belong to
the Kingdom of God,

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to the pure land of the Buddha,
and if you are truly the here

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:90%
and now, you can get in touch.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So you can live
your spiritual life

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
in every minute of
your daily life.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether you are driving,
eating, cooking, washing,

It's not the human who is
whispering in the ear of a dog.

are looking for happiness
in the future or elsewhere.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But according to the
teaching of the Buddha,

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you have enough conditions to be
happy right here and right now.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And mindfulness help you to
go home to the present moment

and to recognize these
conditions of happiness that

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:90%
are available.

appointment with life,

and that appointment takes
place in the present moment.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%

That is a practice.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%

every step brings you

research on meditation--

and I'm sure it applies
to mindfulness as well--

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:84%
is that it increases the level
of an enzyme called telomerase.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Telomerase influences the
length of little telomeres,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:84%
which are like buttons at
the end of your shoe laces.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, your chromosomes have
these buttons similar to that.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
As we get older,
these buttons or--

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
they're called telomeres--
they start to fray,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and then when they start
to fray to a certain level,

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:90%
that's biological death.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And we measure the
biological clock

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:90%
through the length of telomeres.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, just a few
months ago, there

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
was a study that was done by
scientists here in California.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the authors
of the study is

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the woman who won the
Nobel Prize for discovering

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:84%
telomerase, and they showed
that within three to four months

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of meditative
practice, mindfulness,

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.680 align:middle line:90%
you increase telomerase.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Other people, when they
hear the same sentence,

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:90%
they don't get angry.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But you, you get angry because
of the seat of anger in you

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:90%
is too important.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So you now-- you
have the insight

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
that the suffering
comes from you more than

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:90%
from the other person.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So that is the kind of insight
that can help you to transform.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look
deeply at the other person,

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:84%
you see that that person has
a lot of anger and suffering

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:90%
in him.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And he does not know how
to handle his suffering,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.340 align:middle line:84%
so he makes people
around him suffer,

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and you happen to
be one of them.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you try to punish
him, he will suffer more,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and if he suffer more, he
will make you suffer more.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So that person needs help
and does not need punishment.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And you may be motivated by
the desire to go and help him.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you are motivated by
a desire to go and help him,

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:84%
your anger has
become compassion.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You have transformed, so
that is the kind of insight

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that you can get
when you practice

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:90%
mindfulness and concentration.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The human brain is a very
fascinating, three pound, soft,

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:84%
jello-like organ
inside the skull,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:84%
which is more complicated than
anything else in the universe.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We have three
parts to our brain.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.560 align:middle line:84%
The first part of the brain
is called the midbrain.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
It's also called
the reptilian brain.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:84%
The reptilian brain evolved
300 million years ago.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's called
the reptilian brain

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.310 align:middle line:84%
is that when you go
next to a reptile

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and you either make a sudden
movement or a sudden noise,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.080 align:middle line:84%
if you're very close, the
reptile will attack you.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're a little further
away, it will slither away.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning of what
we call the fight or flight

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.460 align:middle line:84%
response, and this then
becomes, in our society,

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:90%
the stress response.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to save
yourself from a saber tooth

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
tiger, but somebody
blows the horn at you

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.625 align:middle line:84%
or somebody says
something that triggers,

00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and all the hurt
pushes your buttons

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.600 align:middle line:90%
and you attack or you run.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you're not
attacking or running,

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:84%
but you feel frustrated and
that raises your blood pressure.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Heart rate goes up.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol goes up.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Adrenaline goes up.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Stress is linked to almost every
major epidemic of civilization.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is cancer or
heart disease or infections

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:84%
or premature aging, sudden death
from cardiovascular illness,

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.380 align:middle line:90%
all linked to stress.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the stress
is, the midbrain reacting as it

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:90%
has done for 300 million years.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
part of your brain

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:84%
is called the
limbic brain, which

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:90%
is about 100 million years old.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:90%
This is our emotional brain.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have basically
five emotions,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
is a variant of them.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.935 align:middle line:84%
The first emotion is happiness,
so love, compassion, kindness.

00:32:27.935 --> 00:32:29.055 align:middle line:90%
They all fit in happiness.

00:32:29.055 --> 00:32:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It makes you happy
when you're in love.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:90%
The second emotion is sadness.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The third is anger
and hostility.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:90%
The fourth is fear.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The fifth is shame,
and what do you call--

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:90%
guilt. And every other emotion--

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:84%
disgust, jealousy--
is a variant of these.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out that
when you're happy--

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and this happens
only in mammals.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Reptiles don't have
a emotional life.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But all mammals
form social groups.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.540 align:middle line:90%
All mammals nurture their young.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
all mammals sing.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:14.820 align:middle line:84%
All mammals play, and
this is the experience

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of what we call love
that occurs immediately

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
after a child is born and even
in the anticipation of a child.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
our feedback loops,

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
self-repair mechanisms
in the body,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
are matured and
come into existence

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
experience of love.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have that attention,
affection, appreciation,

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.590 align:middle line:84%
cooing cuddling,
kissing, touching,

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.470 align:middle line:84%
the dance between an
adult and a child,

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
which is eye movements, facial
expressions, body language,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.875 align:middle line:90%
voice tone--

00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:84%
a child doesn't understand
rational language

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:84%
but understands that
language from day one, OK?

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is it responsible
for the maturation

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of self-repair mechanisms
and self-regulation.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're deprived of that,
you will be a sick adult.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:84%
When you grow up,
your everything

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.540 align:middle line:84%
will be affected because
the self-repair is linked

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
to hormone levels,
body temperature

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.540 align:middle line:84%
regulation, autonomic
responses, everything

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:90%
that keeps the body healthy.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.500 align:middle line:90%
That's our limbic brain.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
dysfunctional limbic systems,

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in that they're resentful
or angry about the past.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:84%
They're anticipating
something fear in the future.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:84%
They have shame and
guilt about things

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that they regret that
they shouldn't have done.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you
their biological systems

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:90%
are totally disrupted.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, when you
have what the Buddhists call

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:84%
loving-kindness, joy, peace
of mind, and compassion--

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhists call them
divine attributes--

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in that state your body's the
best it could possibly be, OK?

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's your limbic
brain, and then you

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:84%
have this cortical
brain, which is huge,

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:84%
which is only four
million years old.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
The cortical brain
houses rationality.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's also responsible for
orchestrating intention,

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and it seems this
is the place we

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
use for imagination and insight
and intuition and creativity.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the secret.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:84%
In mindfulness, what
you can learn to do--

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is proven
scientifically--

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:44.010 align:middle line:84%
you can totally
override your midbrain.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So a person like Thich
Nhat Hahn, for example,

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.670 align:middle line:84%
for all practical
purposes, his midbrain

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:90%
is no longer functioning.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:58.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't get him to be angry
or feel hostility or resentful.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
He's just-- he's quieted it
through mindfulness practice.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you sustain that
mindfulness practice,

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:84%
you feel so connected
that spontaneously,

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.510 align:middle line:84%
your limbic system starts to get
activated so you nurture only

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
healthy emotions, like
love, compassion, joy, et

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.050 align:middle line:84%
cetera, that come from
that place of equanimity.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So you're using
your cortical brain

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:31.560 align:middle line:84%
to, first of all, override
the detrimental, destructive

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:84%
tendencies of the
midbrain, which

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is no longer relevant
in the modern society,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're also activating
the limbic brain

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.130 align:middle line:90%
for nurturing relationships.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
You're literally rewiring
your nervous system.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
In neuroscience, we say
neurons that fire together

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.390 align:middle line:90%
wire together.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.820 align:middle line:84%
You're an intelligent
human being

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
who has subdued the
reptilian brain, who

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:84%
knows how to activate
the limbic brain, who

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
knows how to
self-repair and heal,

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.890 align:middle line:84%
who has more intuition, insight,
imagination, creativity,

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and choice making.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a new evolution
of the human species.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine a situation where
your day was going fine.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Someone looked at
you in a way that you

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
imagined was attacking,
accusatory, or judgmental,

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.270 align:middle line:90%
and you get angry.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, whereas in the past, you
might have become very angry

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and disregulated and done
behaviors that got you

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
into more trouble, whether
it's drugs or alcohol

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.110 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, what
you do with mindfulness

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:39.340 align:middle line:84%
is you pay attention to what
is in this present moment.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.690 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Describe what happened.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The person looked at me
from the side of their face.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:90%
They seem to have a frown.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
you're describing,

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.890 align:middle line:84%
you're describing what is,
not what you imagine it to be.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, it
gives you a fighting chance

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:84%
of staying a lot calmer than
what you could have gone,

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.800 align:middle line:84%
because once you
start describing,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.090 align:middle line:84%
then you also have the
opportunity to be curious.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:84%
You might ask the
person, hey, why did you

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:90%
give me that bad look?

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.700 align:middle line:90%
He say, what bad look?

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I have gastric problems from the
burrito I had at lunch today,

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.080 align:middle line:90%
and maybe I was grimacing.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.497 align:middle line:84%
>> We should be
listening to each other.

00:38:21.497 --> 00:38:22.330 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Because often, it's little
things that we misinterpret

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and we go into fight/flight
avoidance between you and I.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:90%
We don't go into surrender.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But once we listen,
we understand.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I get it.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> During the day,
these always--

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:84%
life never unfold
exactly like we wish,

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and so we have to expect that
when people promise something,

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:90%
they don't do it.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's normal that
we feel irritate.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But we feel irritate, we
say that when I'm irritate,

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I do not fulfill my
task in the best way.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So I go back to my in
breath and out breath

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and calming and relaxing
and say that I will do it.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So you note that
unsatisfied thing,

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and you do other thing who
make you not irritate first.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:90%
You come back.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.080 align:middle line:90%
You will come back.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.910 align:middle line:84%
But while you do the
other job profoundly,

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the other things will
settle a little bit.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.352 align:middle line:84%
And then sometime
during your work--

00:39:23.352 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the second work have nothing
to do with the first work that

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:90%
make you irritate.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Second, work
mindfully-- suddenly

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:84%
that is an insight
because your irritation

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:84%
send the message into
your soul consciousness.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It mean the deep part of
yourself, your unconscious.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:90%
That person is always like that.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.710 align:middle line:90%
He has that quality.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:90%
He has that weakness.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, you remember
that to handle that situation,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to touch
that point in order

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to help him to change
or help her to change.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So and then you go
back to your work.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.730 align:middle line:84%
You say, that, I
don't handle yet.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:01.045 align:middle line:84%
>> You're listening to the
outcome, not the fundamentals.

00:40:01.045 --> 00:40:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's fundamentals,
technique, and outcome.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people
sees aggression.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:90%
I see before aggression.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I can
prevent aggression.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Just take those three seconds
when you walk into a room

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and when you walk into
any new situation.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And that helps me quite a bit
because we're taking in so much

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that I find if I just don't
just blow through everything

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and I take those three seconds,
or I get a new situation, if I

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.400 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I will find that I have
that intuitive notion,

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and if I just I just hit
it there for a second.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I've got the information that
I need to handle each given

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:84%
situation, that it's
been put before me

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and I have it in
my head account.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been given that
information already.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it somewhere.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:90%
I have it in my mind.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I've been prepared for the
things that are befalling me.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually ready.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You almost see it
before it happens.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.150 align:middle line:90%
You can see it coming.

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.150 align:middle line:90%
It's like if you would see--

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:84%
like a tsunami, you see the
wave far out in the ocean.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.910 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's slow motion.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Ah, there's the wave.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll go get my
stuff, put it in the car,

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and drive far up
in the mountain,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.270 align:middle line:84%
long before the wave
comes to the shore.

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In mindfulness, there's
also these mindful practices.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:36.030 align:middle line:84%
First, you you evoke
love and compassion

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:40.110 align:middle line:84%
in your mind for somebody
that it would be easy

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:45.870 align:middle line:84%
for you to do, like your child
or your spouse or somebody

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.060 align:middle line:90%
that you really care about.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.100 align:middle line:90%
You evoke that in your mind.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.190 align:middle line:84%
You observe an act of
compassion or love.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But then you could go to
the mall and see a stranger.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you're mindful,
you'll realize

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that that stranger
has joy and sorrow,

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:84%
like you do, pleasure
and pain, like you do,

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to grow old, like you
do, who's going to die one day,

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.520 align:middle line:90%
like you do.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you have compassion

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.960 align:middle line:84%
for that human being,
because he's just like you.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can do that with
an enemy, a perceived enemy.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, you train
your mind in such a way

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.115 align:middle line:84%
that you deprive
yourself of all enemies.

00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's one of the
things that people enjoy

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:90%
the most about an animal, right?

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The number one is
unconditional love.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Number two is how
present they are.

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Number three is they
live in the moment.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Number four is there
the master of forgiving.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.420 align:middle line:84%
How many times human
makes mistakes.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Every single day.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:90%
How often the dog forgive them?

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Every single day.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the best goals of
Buddhism is to take negative

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
energy and make it positive, and
that's not always easy to do.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> During the war in Vietnam, I
heard that my hometown had been

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.960 align:middle line:90%
bombarded.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I right away took many
means to go to my hometown.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I arrived, I
was so mad because most

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:90%
of the house, big cows--

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:19.500 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, only my
house is halfly bombarded,

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.230 align:middle line:90%
but we still live in.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Parts of other house
have been bombed,

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and people cry and
scream and they

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:90%
say, oh, they hate all the--

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.770 align:middle line:84%
they hate the sight
of nationalist.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.370 align:middle line:84%
They hate the
sight of communist.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:90%
They said that.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And the communist
tried to provoke,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and then the nationalists called
American plane to bombard.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm angry at everything.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, and so I
said that, what I can do?

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I went back to my breath,
and I walk calmly.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Mindfully, I walk.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And during, I tried to
be mindful in my step.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
It means my mind
only with the contact

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.310 align:middle line:90%
of my shoes and the ground.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.110 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And I walk.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I walk, and suddenly,
among the green,

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I started the little
flower, very tiny,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:25.290 align:middle line:84%
little violet flower come
through all the rain,

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.490 align:middle line:90%
like smiling.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh,
the little flower.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They have to grow through
all this wind and bloom.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And me, I cannot be my peace?

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I calm myself,
and I look around.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to see
positive things.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I see that the people who try
their best to do something

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to help those who
are wounded, those

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:90%
who are still very something.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And so there are people who make
rice more to go and distribute

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.720 align:middle line:90%
to those who have nothing.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.890 align:middle line:84%
There are those who
carry because bombard

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.120 align:middle line:90%
is gone already.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel that I see many
bodhisattva, many great being,

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.150 align:middle line:84%
who are not angry like
me and want to shout,

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:21.490 align:middle line:84%
but they try to help
to do normal thing, so

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.150 align:middle line:90%
that these things to the--

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:30.000 align:middle line:84%
going to my peace that I can
see many wonderful things.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you have your own
peace, you know what to do

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.716 align:middle line:90%
and what not to do.

They get busy in
order to forget.

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:38.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, the fear
does not have a foundation.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:58.410 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of things
that do not exist,

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and that is why they
need to look deeply,

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:10.120 align:middle line:84%
or they might need a
friend to tell them

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that their fear
has no foundation

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:25.520 align:middle line:84%
so that they can recognize
the nature of their fear

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.120 align:middle line:90%
and get liberate.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:37.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a wonderful
practice in Buddhism

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:44.150 align:middle line:84%
that is very helpful for
us to reduce our suffering.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:49.250 align:middle line:84%
That is the practice of
avoiding the second arrow.

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:52.550 align:middle line:90%
When someone is stuck by--

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:56.990 align:middle line:84%
when someone is hit by
an arrow, that person's

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.480 align:middle line:90%
suffers, of course.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But if a second arrow comes
and strike him or her exactly

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:12.200 align:middle line:84%
at the same spot, the pain
will be many, many times

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:18.410 align:middle line:84%
more intense, and that is why
it is very helpful to avoid

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:19.640 align:middle line:90%
the second arrow.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddha said that
sometime something happen

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:29.690 align:middle line:84%
to your body, to your
mind, you suffer.

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you get angry at it, if
you worry too much about it,

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:84%
you will magnify the
pain into 100 times.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine
too much, if you

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:54.530 align:middle line:84%
don't know the
reality of your pain,

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:58.700 align:middle line:84%
then you will suffer 10
times more or 100 times more.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of anger,
that kind of imagination,

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that kind of fear
intensified your pain

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:90%
by 10 time, 100 time more.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.700 align:middle line:90%
That is the second arrow.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So fear can make you
suffer much more,

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.088 align:middle line:90%
and fear is based on ignorance.

00:49:21.088 --> 00:49:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.845 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
looking deeply help

00:49:26.845 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:84%
you to have the insight
that can dissipate,

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.540 align:middle line:90%
remove your ignorance.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And a [INAUDIBLE]
friend can help

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:39.460 align:middle line:84%
you to see that your
fear has no foundation.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I grew up on a
farm, number one.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with a philosophy
of never work against Mother

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Nature.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Always make sure you, human,
gain their trust, respect them.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:53.770 align:middle line:84%
They're going to give you a
beautiful gift called loyalty.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So once you grew up with
those two sentences,

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:90%
this is what you become, right?

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.450 align:middle line:90%
You live a philosophy.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:05.523 align:middle line:84%
You live a lifestyle that
triggers an energy in you.

00:50:05.523 --> 00:50:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the animal
world, this is

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.380 align:middle line:84%
very attractive, to
be calm from within.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Because animals' biggest goal
is the family and the harmony,

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to be part of a family and
to live a harmonious life.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Once you study human,
that's not his goal.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.040 align:middle line:90%
His goal is fame.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.360 align:middle line:90%
His goal is money.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.642 align:middle line:90%
His goal is a degree.

00:50:29.642 --> 00:50:31.350 align:middle line:84%
My clients are Harvard
graduate, but they

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:32.490 align:middle line:90%
can't walk a chihuahua.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:34.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether you have a
psychological reason or whether

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:39.870 align:middle line:84%
you have a spiritual thing, it
is undeniable that stress is

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:43.650 align:middle line:84%
taking a massive
toll on this country,

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:47.910 align:middle line:84%
how we think about each other,
and that by bringing mindful

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.940 align:middle line:84%
practice back, an ancient
practice that was always

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.770 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom to use it
was always there--

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
back into our lives,
we begin to have

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:01.800 align:middle line:84%
a much healthier and holistic
way of approaching stress,

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, bring a stillness
and contentment to our life

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that is more profound
than any quick hit.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We do things the way we
do because we're not aware.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.130 align:middle line:90%
So then it's just a pattern.

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:16.920 align:middle line:84%
You go out every Friday
night and things like that,

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.780 align:middle line:90%
but it becomes very boring.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But you still go because
what else do you do?

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:90%
So I share with teenagers that--

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:90%
be aware of what's going on.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
sense of calmness,

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.940 align:middle line:84%
it's actually very
attractive to others.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.610 align:middle line:84%
When you are calm
and composed and you

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.220 align:middle line:84%
seem to be at ease
with yourself,

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.820 align:middle line:84%
all the guys will
come and ask you.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Or you have enough confidence
to go and ask a guy to dance.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little tip I
share with the young people.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people can have these
things happen just because you

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:57.390 align:middle line:90%
need some help.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You need some way to
balance your life.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:06.030 align:middle line:84%
For me, this mindfulness,
this way to be responsible,

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.910 align:middle line:84%
this way to be
respectful to yourself

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and others, this way to
find a quiet journey when

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the world just seems too chaotic
and when things are happening

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to you and you
think, I just don't

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:25.560 align:middle line:84%
know how I can handle
all of these things.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.750 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a balance.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is just great all the
time, and you're going to--

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:37.320 align:middle line:84%
life is difficult.
Life is a struggle.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to work hard
to have things go ahead.

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And life doesn't get easier,
but things get easier

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:49.080 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Neurotic environment
makes a neurotic dog.

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Aggressive environment
makes an aggressive dog.

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.020 align:middle line:84%
A fearful environment
makes a fearful dog.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.310 align:middle line:90%
[MEDITATION CHIME]

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.670 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> For those of us who have
looked deeply into the nature

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:13.040 align:middle line:84%
of sickness, of
death, of old age,

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.416 align:middle line:90%
we can also transcend our fear.

00:53:15.416 --> 00:53:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Because looking deeply, we can
see that it is possible for us

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to go through these things
peacefully, sickness,

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:32.630 align:middle line:90%
old age, and death.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:38.960 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a cloud
and if you look deeply,

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the
nature of a cloud

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:44.615 align:middle line:84%
is a nature of no
birth and no death.

00:53:44.615 --> 00:53:50.150 align:middle line:84%
A cloud has not
come from non-being

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:53.510 align:middle line:90%
before the cloud is a cloud.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:57.770 align:middle line:84%
The cloud had been
other things, so a cloud

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.500 align:middle line:90%
has not come from nothing.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So the nature of the
cloud is no birth.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.850 align:middle line:84%
The appearance of the
cloud, the form of a cloud

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:09.830 align:middle line:90%
is only a continuation.

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Before the cloud is a cloud,
it has been the water vapor.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It has been the
water in the ocean,

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.000 align:middle line:90%
the heat generated by the sun.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So the cloud is
only a continuation.

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And when the cloud cease to
be a cloud, that's not dying.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.030 align:middle line:90%
A cloud cannot die.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:37.726 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible
for a cloud to die.

00:54:37.726 --> 00:54:43.040 align:middle line:84%
A cloud can become
rain, snow, or ice,

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.430 align:middle line:84%
but a cloud cannot
become nothing.

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And if the cloud
knows how to meditate,

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:57.620 align:middle line:84%
it will see that this nature is
nature of no death, no drying.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.160 align:middle line:84%
To be a cloud floating
in the sky is wonderful,

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.230 align:middle line:84%
but to become the rain falling
on a rice field on a mountain

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:04.880 align:middle line:90%
is also wonderful.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.400 align:middle line:90%


00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And a cloud can look down
and see part of the cloud

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:17.420 align:middle line:84%
has become the river, so to
become a river is so nice.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you practice
meditation deeply,

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.910 align:middle line:84%
you see that your
nature is nature

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:24.800 align:middle line:84%
of no birth and
no death, and you

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.963 align:middle line:84%
can transcend the fear of
birth and death, you see?

00:55:29.963 --> 00:55:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
ways of practice

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:35.120 align:middle line:90%
in order to deal with our fear.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And because we are so
busy now in daily life,

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:42.390 align:middle line:84%
we have no time in
our life to practice.

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:47.360 align:middle line:84%
We have become victims of our
fear and anger, frustration.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
is very important

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that everyone in society should
bring in a spiritual dimension

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.370 align:middle line:84%
to their life, so that
they will suffer less.

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:03.560 align:middle line:84%
A politician, a businessman,
a schoolteacher, a filmmaker

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:09.230 align:middle line:84%
should bring in their
life a spiritual dimension

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:13.140 align:middle line:90%
so that they will suffer less.

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And when they suffer less, they
can do their job much better.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no need to fear death
because death doesn't happen

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.470 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Death is-- basically,
you upgrade the illusion,

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.400 align:middle line:90%
I think, after death.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no way to happiness.

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is the way.

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.220 align:middle line:90%
There is no way to peace.

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Peace is the way.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And the way is to
breathe in mindfully.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.520 align:middle line:84%
The way is to take one
mindful step because when

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:46.300 align:middle line:84%
you when you do that, the energy
of mindfulness is generated.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And it is exactly with
that energy of mindfulness

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:52.790 align:middle line:84%

you cannot offer peace.

If you don't have calm,
you cannot offer calm.

If you don't have compassion,
you cannot offer compassion.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
have to walk your path.

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:26.960 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it for you first.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.110 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know how to
take care of yourself,

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:31.700 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know
how to love yourself,

success, then your whole body

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:05.270 align:middle line:90%

That's mindfulness.

That guarantees success, but
you're not attached to it

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.290 align:middle line:90%
because it comes from within.

are attached think

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:37.550 align:middle line:84%
there's something out there that
is the source of their success

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:39.580 align:middle line:90%
or whatever happiness.

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:43.340 align:middle line:84%
But happiness, success,
all these things

that human beings pursue, the
source is within yourself.

>> It's a training, a training
to remember that in us,

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:57.540 align:middle line:84%
there is that ability to be very
peaceful, very understanding,

00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.910 align:middle line:90%
very loving.

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But with the busy life,
and especially if we are

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:06.150 align:middle line:84%
surround by very
negative condition,

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:09.860 align:middle line:90%
we are easily irritate.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we irritate, we
are like a pond of water

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:19.670 align:middle line:84%
very turbulent and you do
not see anything clear.

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And then practice is to
restore the stillness

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:26.430 align:middle line:84%
of the water in you,
the peace in you.

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you see,
you are a limpid,

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:31.640 align:middle line:90%
more clear in your mind.

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.310 align:middle line:90%
You see thing in its totality.

00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I usually say that when
your mind is agitate,

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:43.010 align:middle line:84%
you look at the moon and
you only see little piece.

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:47.870 align:middle line:84%
But when your mind is still,
you can see the whole totality

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:48.990 align:middle line:90%
of the full moon.

said that no matter how much

00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.587 align:middle line:84%

00:59:59.587 --> 01:00:00.920 align:middle line:90%
you remember the story of Jesus?

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.960 align:middle line:90%
He was condemned too.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.880 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much the
world condemns the man,

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.710 align:middle line:84%
open your heart to what
that man is saying.

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:11.450 align:middle line:90%
There might be a message there.

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:13.970 align:middle line:84%

the psychiatrist who's got 15

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.160 align:middle line:90%
minutes to write a prescription.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult for them
to integrate mindfulness

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.570 align:middle line:90%
into those practices.

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:24.470 align:middle line:84%
For people who have a full
hour, they're able to do this.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But the irony or the silliness
to this is that a prescription

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
that I give you-- that I write,
and I can write every month--

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
you take it once a day, comes
with side effects, costs

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
you, costs the
insurance company.

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness-- and I
sometimes do this.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.283 align:middle line:84%
I'll take up my prescription
pad, and they'll say,

01:00:44.283 --> 01:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
you need to give me
something for anxiety.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So I say, I've got
just the thing for you.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'll write this--

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:54.380 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness, take
daily as needed,

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
may repeat as many
times as you want.

01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:59.865 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll take out this
and I'll hand it to them

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and they'll look at
me as if I'm crazy.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, this is
the way out for you.

There is a way to suffer
that can bring relief.

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And everyone wants to learn
how to suffer like that

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:21.020 align:middle line:90%
in order not to suffer.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.410 align:middle line:90%
And the practice is very clear.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.322 align:middle line:84%
Don't be afraid
of your suffering.

01:01:26.322 --> 01:01:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Live with it.

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Take one deep breath,
come back to yourself,

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and recognize the suffering
and try to hold it dearly.

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
You can do that because while
you are breathing in mindfully,

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
you generate the
energy of mindfulness.

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is exactly with
that energy of mindfulness

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can recognize and
embrace your suffering.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you are
overwhelmed by your suffering.

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
The practice of
mindful breathing,

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
the practice of mindful
walking helps generate

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:01.060 align:middle line:90%
that energy of mindfulness.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Without that
mindfulness, you are

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:05.560 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmed by your suffering.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.170 align:middle line:84%
With that mindfulness,
you are able to recognize

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
the suffering, embrace it,
and be at peace with it.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is how you
learn how to suffer.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, at Gallup,
we've done studies--

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.025 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of Gallup
organization--

01:02:22.025 --> 01:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that if you have a happy friend,
your happiness goes up by 15%.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.470 align:middle line:84%
If you have a happy friend
who has a happy friend,

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.200 align:middle line:90%
it goes up another 10%.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And if the happy friend's happy
friend has a happy friend,

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:35.260 align:middle line:90%
it goes up again, incrementally.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So your happiness is dependent
on the happiness of others,

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:40.660 align:middle line:90%
and we are all entangled.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
We are entangled
horizontally now,

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
not only through relationships
but through social networks,

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Twitter or Facebook,
this, that, and the other.

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
The other day, somebody
asked me on Twitter,

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.160 align:middle line:90%
how do I find the right person?

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And I just tweeted back.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, instead of finding
the right person become

01:02:58.690 --> 01:02:59.760 align:middle line:90%
the right person.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, within five minutes,
people started retweeting it.

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And in five hours,
five million people

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.730 align:middle line:90%
were passing on the message.

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So our emotions are contagious,
our thoughts, our insights.

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And these networks
are taking that mind

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and proving what I said, that
there is no separate self.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And not only is there no
separate self horizontally

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
but vertically
because your mind is

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
influenced by the
cultural mind that

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.320 align:middle line:90%
goes back millions of years.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So vertically-- we
exchange meaning

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
through each other horizontally
through relationship,

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is through
social networks--

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
but vertically through
culture and history.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
you go deep enough,

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
your mind is all mind ever
since the beginning of time.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But it is also very important
to be careful and understand

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that you have to be
mindful of your compassion,

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that there are people who
are not quality people,

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and there are people who choose
to be lost each and every day.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.260 align:middle line:90%
There are people that are--

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
if you keep giving
them your love,

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:18.470 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to get better.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
They're not people who were
just hurt in their childhood

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and if you love them and
love them and love them,

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.390 align:middle line:90%
you're going to fix them.

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so if you just keep being
compassionate and loving

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and they keep being
mean and abusive,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
your compassion is going
to make them better.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.750 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
wake up every day,

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.300 align:middle line:90%
and they're lost on purpose.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important for
you to be mindful of yourself

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and to observe people with
thoughtful mindfulness--

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
mindful of yourself,
mindful of them--

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and be aware if that person is
choosing to be lost every day.

You know what I mean?

The human is programmed

but when it's money
involved and then

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.950 align:middle line:90%
it becomes single-oriented.

What everybody wants is
trust, respect, and love,

They don't need another
person to tell them.

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
They have learned from
their own suffering.

01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
They know that they
waste their life if they

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:56.280 align:middle line:90%
live without mindfulness.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
The opposite of mindfulness
is forgetfulness.

You live in forgetfulness.

your mindfulness last
just one or two seconds.

So if you train
yourself, then you

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.840 align:middle line:90%
can be mindful for longer times.

identify with being a

or whatever it is, it's this
really alternative practice.

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, mindfulness is
being practiced in Ivy League

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
schools, at all the
major universities,

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of therapists
and psychologists

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:31.550 align:middle line:90%
are doing it themselves.

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.008 align:middle line:84%
Although you wouldn't
know about it

01:07:33.008 --> 01:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
talking about it,

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people who are
serious members of society--

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that are very respected, who
wouldn't be connected with

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.950 align:middle line:90%

solitude, and a solitude

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that's disciplined in the
sense that you have to--

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
when you wander off into
the clouds of thoughts

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:14.270 align:middle line:84%

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.529 align:middle line:90%
A non-Buddhist can do it.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:26.229 align:middle line:84%
A Christian, a Jew, a
communist-- everyone can do it.

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:27.029 align:middle line:90%

>> I think if you
start with say,

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.609 align:middle line:84%
mindful awareness of
breath as a lifestyle,

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
it soon becomes a meditative
experience living.

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The only way to
do it is to practice.

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:41.848 align:middle line:84%
And it is true, like
with any other skill

01:08:41.848 --> 01:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
with any other practice,
that the more you do it,

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:45.200 align:middle line:90%
the better you get at it.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And the more
efficient it becomes,

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.335 align:middle line:90%
and the easier it is to do.

01:08:48.335 --> 01:08:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter what the
situation in the world,

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.950 align:middle line:90%
you can breathe through it.

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And the breath is the link
between the body and the mind.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.920 align:middle line:90%
And tends to the breath--

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
you go back and you
pay attention only

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.412 align:middle line:84%
to the in breath, the air which
is entering into your lung,

01:09:04.412 --> 01:09:06.109 align:middle line:90%
and you're calm.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:08.729 align:middle line:90%
Breathing out, you relax.

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:10.270 align:middle line:90%
You calm.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:13.609 align:middle line:84%
You relax when you
do it for a while,

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:16.439 align:middle line:84%
and then you touch
slowly your peace.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
peace, you start to think

01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:24.859 align:middle line:90%
and you start to speak or act.

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:28.229 align:middle line:84%
So that is the key point for
those who practice mindfulness.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The breathing in
should be pleasant.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.399 align:middle line:84%
If you don't feel a pleasure
when you're breath in,

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
you are not really
practicing correctly.

01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, you might just
focus your attention to your

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:45.319 align:middle line:90%
in breath.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:47.779 align:middle line:84%
Your in breath might be
short, not very peaceful.

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:49.899 align:middle line:84%
But you allow it
to be like that.

01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:51.979 align:middle line:84%
You just allow
yourself to breathe in

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and to become aware
of your in breath.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you continue like that,
your in breath and out breath

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
will be come deeper, more
harmonious, more peaceful

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
by itself alone.

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:10.857 align:middle line:90%
That is the miracle of practice.

01:10:10.857 --> 01:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And when your in
breath and out breath

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.090 align:middle line:84%
has become a little bit
deeper, slower, more peaceful,

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:20.120 align:middle line:90%
your body will profit from it.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The stress, the
tension in your body

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.070 align:middle line:84%
will be reduced because
you'll know how to breathe

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:31.580 align:middle line:90%
in peacefully and with harmony.

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And so even if you
have a painful feeling,

01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
a painful emotion within
yourself, mindful breathing,

01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the peaceful breathing will help
you to suffer less right away.

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When I wake up, I train
myself to see that I have 24

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:51.800 align:middle line:90%
hour to live deeply.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that my
day is only wonderful.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I have many stressful
thing to do.

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But I say that I vow to make
my days more relaxing, even I

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of expiring
date, project due to finish.

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But I have to do that in
order to remind myself.

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:12.100 align:middle line:90%
That is the first act.

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I start to
stand them up and walk,

01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.540 align:middle line:90%
and I walk mindfully.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.440 align:middle line:90%
That is straining.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't see a
dog as a student,

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I see a dog as a teacher.

01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
What the human have to do is
to humble himself and learn

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
from an animal
because a human always

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.110 align:middle line:90%
wants to teach the animal.

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> For businessmen walking
from one building to another,

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.290 align:middle line:84%
he might enjoy
every step he make.

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:43.990 align:middle line:90%


01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
He has to make a
decision, of course.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.170 align:middle line:90%
But why walking?

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.930 align:middle line:90%


01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
He might like to enjoy
every step that he makes.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And if he can get the
peace, the joy while

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
walking, when he
arrived is fresh

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and he can make a
better decision.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Quiet doesn't mean calm.

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:11.360 align:middle line:90%


01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting down,
which a lot of people

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:15.230 align:middle line:90%
interpret as he's calm.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:20.885 align:middle line:84%
No, quiet and calm is
two different things.

01:12:20.885 --> 01:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
"I am calm, Cesar."

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.660 align:middle line:90%
They're quiet.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.230 align:middle line:90%


01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:31.930 align:middle line:90%
This is calm, not calm, calm.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> With mindfulness
practice and meditation,

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
you can turn on the good genes
and turn off the bad genes.

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
There are about 400 to 500
genes that influence things

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
like inflammation, autoimmune
illnesses, heart disease,

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and certain types of cancer.

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Within four months, you
can turn on the good ones

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and turn off the bad ones
through the following things--

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
good sleep, meditation,
mindfulness, exercise,

01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
healthy relationships, and
a reasonably good diet,

01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:11.950 align:middle line:84%
which means not eating
anything that comes in a can

01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:12.790 align:middle line:90%
or has a label.

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So that is genetic
indeterminism,

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
which means regulating
your own genes.

01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And then neuroplasticity-- when
you change your brain structure

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
through mindful practices,
you're going through the genes.

01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And neurons that fire
together, wire together.

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.890 align:middle line:90%
You're laying down new proteins.

01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
In order to lay
down new proteins,

01:13:31.330 --> 01:13:33.202 align:middle line:90%
you've got to go through DNA.

01:13:33.202 --> 01:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go through
what is called transcription

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and translation,
so you're actually

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:39.910 align:middle line:90%
turning on genes to do that.

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I have said that there
are people who learn from

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
themselves, from
their own suffering.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.130 align:middle line:84%

best thing you might offer,

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%

But you cannot do that

>> So how do we, then, begin
to integrate mindfulness?

01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I think there has to be
a point at which you say,

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing isn't
working for me.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The other solutions--
talking to my friends--

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.960 align:middle line:84%
isn't working for me, if
it isn't, and so I now

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.070 align:middle line:90%
need to do something else.

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that for
a lot of Westerners,

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
they are so used to very
rapid results, where

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:23.220 align:middle line:90%
everything is, I want this now.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The practice of
mindfulness can sometimes

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
take much longer
than a pill does.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So certainly, a line
of cocaine or a line

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
or a shot of heroin
or a drug is going

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.580 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel
better much quicker.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day
though, is that the aftermath

01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
of that line of
cocaine and the heroin

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.870 align:middle line:90%
is tremendous unhappiness.

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's a short-term solution
to a long term problem.

>> It's biologically ingrained
in us to live in a way that is

01:15:55.650 --> 01:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
of the least resistance, the way
that is easiest and also just

01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:04.020 align:middle line:90%
safest.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Like our ancestors,
animals, first human beings

01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
when they lived in a cave,
the most important thing

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%
was to survive, to be safe.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So we developed
instincts that helped us.

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
If we hear a noise, we'll have
a fight or flight response

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:24.180 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Or we see something.

01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
We immediately
categorize it so that we

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
can make a very quick decision
whether it is something

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:36.150 align:middle line:90%
safe or something unsafe.

01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So that was developed very
early in our history as living

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
beings, and so that's
much more ingrained.

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
The capacity to be aware, the
capacity to recognize, to--

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
those are much more
developed, and they

01:16:57.570 --> 01:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
have been developed much later
in our history, especially

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
the evolutionary of human
beings, of the Homo sapiens.

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we have the brain,
the cortex, developed,

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that includes our capacity,
like mindfulness, awareness,

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.800 align:middle line:90%
compassion, altruism.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But those are
developed much later.

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So for us, we live
with our instincts,

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and that's easier and quicker.

01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
We can make a quick
decision, and that's

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:32.550 align:middle line:84%
why I will share later that
life can be very monotonous.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we look at something, we
immediately make a conclusion.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's a tree.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.040 align:middle line:90%
It's an animal.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
It's that friend or that's
my wife or something.

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And we make that
decision immediately,

01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:46.080 align:middle line:90%
and so then it's over.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
The brain doesn't
process anymore.

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the situation,
the person anymore.

01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
The brain shuts down and look
for another new stimulus,

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:56.760 align:middle line:90%
you see?

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
But learning to be
mindful, it takes more work

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.090 align:middle line:84%
because it takes us
to still the mind,

01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
to quiet the mind so that
the brain doesn't just

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
make a top-down control, a
top-down decision to say,

01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:11.730 align:middle line:90%
that is that.

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But we keep the mind
quiet, so that we

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:20.730 align:middle line:84%
continue to process that
stimulus, that person, that--

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:25.090 align:middle line:84%
maybe our wife, our children,
ourselves, our feelings,

01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:26.040 align:middle line:90%
our body.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The brain continues to be in
touch with that in a new way

01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:32.790 align:middle line:90%
we call the beginner's mind.

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
We are in touch with
it new every moment.

01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And it is a mental training.

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
We have that capacity within
us, but the other capacity

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.820 align:middle line:84%
of relying on our
instincts, that's

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
much more ingrained and
much easier and quicker.
