00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:84%
were figuring he was
around 50 pounds,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.900 align:middle line:84%
so it's going to be interesting
to see what he actually

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.445 align:middle line:84%
weighs when we hang
it here on the scale.

00:31:11.445 --> 00:31:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>If It is a he.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>If it is a he, that's correct.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%
If you want read it and
record it there, Neil.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.675 align:middle line:90%
52 pounds, 23 kilos.

00:31:23.675 --> 00:31:26.511 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Big boy.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>So what we're looking
for when we do this is we

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
want to find that the animal's
third right arm-- so here's

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:90%
his eyeballs here.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.960 align:middle line:90%
This is down over his forehead.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:90%
We go to his third right arm.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:90%
So there's one, there's two.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.190 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to head for
the ocean already on us.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Here comes the third right
arm, and on the end of it

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:84%
is the hectocotylus,
the modified tip

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
with no suckers
on it for passing

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:84%
the spermatophore, or the
sperm packet, into the female.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:10.303 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, there he goes.

00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:11.303 align:middle line:90%
>>Heading for the ocean.

00:32:11.303 --> 00:32:12.301 align:middle line:90%

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.282 align:middle line:84%

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:10%
The next major challenge
is to see if octopuses are

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.630 align:middle line:10%
capable of abstract reasoning.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Do their notions
of time and space

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.830 align:middle line:84%
allow them to
imagine the future?

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
In La Coruna, Antonio
Cribeiro is carrying out

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:90%
a maze experiment.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:90%
He has a box with two exits.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:90%
One, a very small hole.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The other exit, a larger
hole, leads into a long tube

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:90%
that ends in the form of a W.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Like it's Vancouver
Island cousins,

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
the octopus analyzes the hole--
too small to get through.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.500 align:middle line:90%
There's only one other option.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The octopus can't see what's
at the end of the tube.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
To take this path
means the animal

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
has to imagine and commit
to an unknown reality.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Danger is lurking.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Even if the octopus may
feel some protection

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
from the Plexiglas
tube, a big grouper,

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the octopus' most
feared predator,

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.340 align:middle line:90%
is right there, watching.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:01.730 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
The immediate danger past,
it continues its escape.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It knows the tube is the only
way to get out of the box,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:13.159 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't know exactly
where the path is leading.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:84%
The octopus uses
the ends of its arms

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:84%
as if they were it's
fingers or its nose,

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.630 align:middle line:90%
and explores each new turn.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:28.889 align:middle line:90%


00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.460 align:middle line:84%
When a predator is
near, the octopus

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.456 align:middle line:84%
goes still, hoping not
to attract its attention.

00:34:34.456 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.094 align:middle line:84%
It then continues its
cautious progress.

00:34:46.094 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.835 align:middle line:90%
Finally, it's arms are free.

00:34:55.835 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:12.440 align:middle line:84%
A last look around, and
it rushes behind a rock.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Mission accomplished.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But Antonio is even more
interested in what comes next.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:84%
If the octopus is put back at
the beginning of the same maze,

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:84%
will it show that it is capable
of learning and remembering?

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.090 align:middle line:84%
This time, it doesn't
bother to test

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:90%
the size of the small hole.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It remembers that it
wasn't big enough.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.000 align:middle line:84%
With no hesitation, it makes
for the opening to the tube

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and goes through it
in a few seconds.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.955 align:middle line:84%
The octopus' memory
is excellent.

00:35:41.955 --> 00:35:44.985 align:middle line:84%
It knew what it would find
at the end of the maze.

is, as a neuroscientist

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and as an individual
who's always

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:84%
been interested in science
in general, the octopus,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.250 align:middle line:84%

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.180 align:middle line:84%
a great mystery and
a great opportunity.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:84%
When I look at an

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:90%
is a totally alien organism.

the nervous system
that essentially

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.670 align:middle line:84%
lies behind this
animal's exterior,

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.530 align:middle line:90%
this is dramatically different.

more precisely,

other neuron groupings

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:90%
at the base of each arm.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:84%
This brain configuration has
nothing in common with anything

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:84%
we know, yet it
harbors an intelligence

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:90%
nearly identical to our own.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>We may be scared by the
structural differences

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that we found in
octopuses brains,

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.370 align:middle line:84%
but the function across the
circuits, the traffic patterns

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that run across
those circuits, I

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:84%
would suspect-- but
I don't know yet,

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that we're going to test--

00:38:54.130 --> 00:39:00.380 align:middle line:84%
is these are circuits that
carry functional information

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.440 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is functionally
similar across all kinds

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of animals, including certain
vertebrates like birds,

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:13.315 align:middle line:84%
like mammals, and
invertebrates like the octopus.

00:39:13.315 --> 00:39:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect
we're going to find

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:19.035 align:middle line:84%
a grand motif, a grand theme
in all of this when we're done.

on the octopus, especially
on their food supply.

that the octopuses
here, probably affected

by the difficulties
of their habitat,

But they notice something
much more surprising.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.010 align:middle line:84%
The octopuses no longer live

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.060 align:middle line:84%
In these waters, the prey

Above all, even
without language,

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:84%
without the possibility of
easily communicating knowledge,

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.660 align:middle line:84%
they have begun to interact,
to observe each other,

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.270 align:middle line:90%
watching each other's reactions.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.340 align:middle line:84%
In the waters off
Capri, it seems

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that the young
octopuses are learning

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.430 align:middle line:90%
by studying the older ones.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Could this be a leap in the
evolution of the species?

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.260 align:middle line:84%
An end to the vicious circle
of coming into the world

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.240 align:middle line:90%
with no adult to learn from.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:84%
If so, the octopuses'
future seems limitless.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:01.760 align:middle line:90%

Back in Naples, Professor
Graziano Fiorito,

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:84%
a pioneer in the study
of the behavioral biology

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.110 align:middle line:84%
of the octopus, in collaboration
with David Edelman,

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
wants to put their
theories into practice.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They want to demonstrate that
the new generation of octopus

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.000 align:middle line:90%
is now learning how to learn.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.520 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>We got an idea
for an experiment

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.202 align:middle line:84%
when we were watching
a Cousteau film.

00:42:27.202 --> 00:42:31.500 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.160 align:middle line:10%
Cousteau showed an octopus
opening a sealed glass

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:10%
container to get to his food.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:10%
In his case, the food was a
lobster, whereas we use crabs.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.870 align:middle line:84%
We wondered what would happen
if we placed two octopuses face

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to face, one who knows
how to open the container,

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:90%
and the other, who doesn't.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to know
if one octopus could

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.680 align:middle line:90%
learn by observing the other.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.800 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We created a box
with three openings.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The difference between the
three openings is how they open.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:15.350 align:middle line:84%
With the first opening,
the cover simply lifts off.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:84%
With the second opening, you
have to twist open the cover.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to twist it first,
and then pull it off.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And the last cover
also pulls off,

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.370 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't come
off completely.

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:84%
We place a crab in
the box, and then we

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.370 align:middle line:90%
wait to see what happens.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:39.930 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>In the lab, the tanks
are divided into two

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:90%
by a glass wall.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.670 align:middle line:84%
A box with a crab in
it is placed in one.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Also in that tank is
Candide, an octopus

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
that was caught by a
fisherman just that morning.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Candide sees the crab,
but doesn't react.

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what the
researchers expected.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.110 align:middle line:90%
The experiment can proceed.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:90%


00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:84%
In the other side of the
tank the same kind of box

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is given to an octopus that
has spent a few days in the lab

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and has learned how to get
into the multiple opening box.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.180 align:middle line:84%
This octopus is
called the trainee.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.415 align:middle line:84%
It immediately starts to open
the box to get at the prey.

00:44:29.415 --> 00:44:39.290 align:middle line:90%


00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Candide watches the trainee.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:90%
His curiosity is aroused.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.620 align:middle line:84%
The trainee isn't
wasting its time.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Candide is visibly
excited and is clearly

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.680 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand what
the octopus is doing.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the trainee
octopus opens the box

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and seizes the crab.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Has Candide really learned
by observing the trainee?

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Will he prove the
Capri theory right?

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a crucial moment
for Graziano and David.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:90%
They won't have to wait long.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:18.060 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Now the glass panel
between the two tanks

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is covered over,
preventing the octopuses

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:90%
from seeing each other.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Candide is left alone
with the problem.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Is he going to succeed?

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Without hesitating, Candide
grapples with the box

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and manages to get it open
in barely a few seconds.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.170 align:middle line:84%
He's observed and
he's understood.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.760 align:middle line:84%
The experiment is
repeated dozens of times,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and the box is placed
in different positions.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.460 align:middle line:84%
The octopus always opens
it on the same side,

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.670 align:middle line:84%
using the same opening,
showing that he didn't simply

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.530 align:middle line:90%
learn to imitate a movement.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.270 align:middle line:84%
He really understood
what had to be done.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the octopus is
about to take a leap ahead

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.190 align:middle line:90%
in the evolutionary scheme.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:11.220 align:middle line:84%
There may be no holding back
its formidable intelligence.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Is this the start of a
Hollywood horror movie?

Perhaps it's best to think of
it this way-- under the sea,

00:46:40.343 --> 00:46:44.670 align:middle line:84%
a new form of higher
intelligence is taking shape.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:47.110 align:middle line:84%
It isn't going to
happen overnight.

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of thousands
of years will probably

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:84%
have to pass before
the octopuses' thinking

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.370 align:middle line:90%
