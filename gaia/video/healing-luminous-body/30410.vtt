00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We differentiate
between healing and curing.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Curing is the
business of medicine.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Curing has to do with
eliminating symptoms.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Healing is the
business of the shaman.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
It's what we do in
our training programs,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
what we train our students to
do through our Healing the Light

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Body School, we're
training Western shamans

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that are able to bring about
healing, which is much more

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:90%
thorough than curing is.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And that frequently
results in curing, as well,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:90%
but does not always.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, some
of my best clients

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:90%
die, but they die peacefully.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:90%
They die nearly pain-free.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:90%
They die consciously.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So healing has to do with
an experience of infinity,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
with an experience
of a self that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.170 align:middle line:84%
exists outside of time, that can
never experience illness, that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
has never been
touched by disease.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Whereas curing has to do
with eliminating symptoms.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you do not address
the root, the cause,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
illness is simply
going to return.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
My mission is to translate
ancient sacred technologies

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
into healing practices that
are powerful and effective

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
in a Western setting.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And these are
methodologies that have

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
been in existence
for 50,000 years.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
They've been proven effective.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
They've been transmitted
through the oral tradition,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
from teacher to student, from
grandmother to granddaughter,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:90%
grandfather to grandson.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And my mission is to bring
these methodologies to the West,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to train Western shamans
in the luminous healing

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
practices of the Americas.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're training
people from all cuts of life

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
to learn to heal themselves,
to learn to heal each other,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and to learn to heal the world.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And this is who the shaman is.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:90%
We are caretakers of the Earth.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And my mission is to
train Western shamans that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
can dream a dream of healing
and of peace and of beauty

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
A healer always works
within sacred space.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And the notion that we
work with and our premise

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
is that we can create
a personal sacred space

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
by calling on the four
corners of the world,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and on the organizing principles
that each of these four corners

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:90%
represent.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:84%
When we summon them, we
create a space that is safe,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
which is an essential
condition for healing to occur.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Many of the clients that
I work with personally

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
are coming to see me because at
an early stage in their life,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:90%
the world ceased to be safe.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And until we can create
an energetic safe space,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
a sacred space, healing is
going to be very difficult.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
We do this by
summoning on the four

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
corners of the world, the
four directions, and Heaven

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and Earth.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But then we work with creating
a second kind of sacred space.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
The first one connects
us to the ecosphere,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to all of the forces of nature.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The second kind of
sacred space connects us

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to the noosphere, which is
the distinctly human sphere--

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to the medicine men and women,
to the luminous beings that

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
assist us from the spirit
world, the spiritual teachers,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:90%
the angels, the luminous ones.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And we have so much
help available to us.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But they cannot intervene
directly in our world.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Our world is too dense.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.375 align:middle line:84%
So we have to create a
microcosm, a microuniverse,

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:56.545 align:middle line:84%
where they can come and assist
us in our healing processes.

00:04:56.545 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they end up
doing so much of the work.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism's an ancient
spiritual and healing practice

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.960 align:middle line:84%
found throughout the
Americas and throughout all

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
traditional cultures in
the world-- in India,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
in Tibet, in Russia,
in Central Europe--

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and practiced most actively
today in the Americas.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman is
the individual who

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
mediates between
Heaven and Earth,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
between the visible
and invisible worlds.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is the
individual who dances

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
on top of the equal sign in
Einstein's famous equation E

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:90%
equals mc squared.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:84%
He dances between
the world of energy

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:90%
and between the world of matter.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is the one who
heals the seas, the one who

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
propitiates the forces
of nature, the one who

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:84%
is able to steer the
village and the individual

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
into a purposeful and
healed and meaningful life.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.145 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine is in
the business of curing.

00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is in the
business of healing.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Curing is the
eliminating of symptoms.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And we all know people
that have received cures

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
but have not
experienced healings.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, the
symptoms generally return.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:90%
The cancer returns.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:90%
The malignancy comes back.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
When you experience
healing, this

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.016 align:middle line:90%
is a transforming experience.

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
It reflects in every
aspect of your life--

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
in your relationships,
in your diet,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
in your job, in your
marriage, and how you relate

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to your children, and in
how you experience illness

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:90%
and wellness.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
What drew me to
the way of shaman

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a practice, a
tradition of the feminine

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and of the Earth.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
The healing practices
that I was exposed

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:84%
to in my academic
training were very based

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:84%
on a masculine approach, as
is all of Western society

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:90%
and mythology.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Medicine evolved during
war, and even still

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
had the terminology of
the battlefield, where

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.772 align:middle line:84%
we fight the crusade
against cancer,

00:07:10.772 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
the battle against
heart disease.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
The ways of the
shaman were not based

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
on developing stronger
antibiotics that could wipe out

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
the critters that were
invading our organism,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
but rather coming into
balance and into peace

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves and
with all of nature.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we did so, our own
bodies' healing systems,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:84%
our immune system, was
able to maintain us

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:90%
in states of excellent health.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So the shamanic
healing practices

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
are founded on enhancing,
on disinhibiting,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.594 align:middle line:90%
the body's own healing response.

00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
What most called
me to the healing

00:07:52.010 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
practices were the mastery that
these individuals demonstrated

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
in transforming what we would
call incurable conditions

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:84%
in the West, in
assisting people to heal

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
from deep emotional
wounds that would require

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
a decade of psychotherapy for
us, all in a period of weeks.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:84%
These were methodologies
that did not

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:84%
rely on a technological fix
or simply chewing mentally

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
your psychological problems,
but on a deep energetic

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:84%
intervention that created
transformation in the body

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and in the mind and in
the soul-- things that

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
were miracles in the
domain of miracles.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated by
a tradition based

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
on a profound
communion with nature.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember walking in the
jungle one time with a medicine

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
man and a medicine woman
that I was studying with.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And we came to a clearing,
and they said to me, Alberto,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
go to the other side of clearing
and into the rain forest

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And I walked in.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And the jungle is always full
of songs of parrots, of macaws,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of monkeys.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And the first step,
the second step,

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:90%
full of rich musical tones.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
step, everything stops.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And they come up to me
and they say, you see?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
They know that you've been
kicked out of the garden.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
They know that you
don't belong here.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And I look at them and I
said, no, that's ridiculous.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I was convinced that the
animals were smelling

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:84%
me-- my deodorant, my athlete's
foot powder, my toothpaste.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I went to
Shipibo Indians who

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:90%
were cooking a boa on a spit.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them if I could
have some of the boa fat.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And I stripped
down to my shorts,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and I smeared my body
in boa fat, convinced

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
that the jungle, I
was sure, was going

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
to perceive another
serpent slithering back in.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And the first step
was full of song.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:84%
The second step and the third
step, everything stops again.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
15 years later

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to
walk into the jungle

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and have it recognize me
as someone who belonged

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
in the garden, and have a
continuous singing around me.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
My work began initially as
a researcher investigating

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:90%
the mind-body interface.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:90%
How does the mind heal the body?

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
How do we create
psychosomatic health

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:90%
or psychosomatic disease?

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And we were actually
cutting and dicing

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and staining the human
brain, and putting it

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
under the microscope
to look for the mind

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
until I realized one day
that I was looking out

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
of the wrong end
of the microscope.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
That I needed to look bigger
instead of smaller and smaller.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I left my laboratory at
San Francisco State University

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and went into the
Amazon and the Andes

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
to work with medicine
women and medicine

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:84%
men who did not have access
to technology as we did,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
who had to rely on the unique
capabilities of the human mind

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:90%
to heal and transform.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And they became my teachers.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:84%
They became my
mentors over 20 years.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I stopped
approaching them as a scientist

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
or as an anthropologist,
and became

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
a student of the shamans.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I was very blessed to have
a teacher, a mentor, who

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:84%
came from the traditional
world and was steeped also

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:84%
in the world of the
West, who really bridged

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:90%
the 16th with the 21st century.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.155 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the
last of the Inca, came

00:11:59.155 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:84%
from the high
mountains of Peru, born

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:90%
in a village at 17,000 feet.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And made his way to the city
of Cuzco, the ancient capital

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Inca Empire,
and was raised

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:84%
in the churches, in
the Catholic churches,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
sweeping and cleaning
the churches.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Went to school, and
eventually became a professor

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
at the university,
of philosophy.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.955 align:middle line:90%
And I traveled with him.

00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I initially hired him to
come with me as a translator.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And we traveled
throughout the villages

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
in the highlands of Peru in
search of the great healers--

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
while, unbeknownst to
me, I was traveling

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
with one of the greatest
healers, one of the most feared

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and loved and respected
healers of the Inca.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
after nearly a year

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.320 align:middle line:84%
of working with him that he
disclosed his other identity.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said to
myself, how blessed

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:90%
I am to have found this man.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that to him
one day, and he said to me,

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Spanish
and the church

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
has been looking
for us for 500 years

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and not been able to find us.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:84%
What makes you think
that you could find me?

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:90%
I am the one who found you.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I was
in his presence,

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I was inside his field, my
perception would open up.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.336 align:middle line:84%
I could perceive the luminous
energy field, the threads

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:90%
that connected us to each other.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I could sense a
person's history.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And I step two feet away
outside of his field,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and all the perception
would disappear.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So the are like
tuning forks that

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:90%
can help us fine-tune ourselves.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:84%
The principal
reason for mentoring

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is that your teacher
helps you to connect

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to a lineage of
medicine men and women

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
that continue to live
in a luminous form,

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
even though their
physical form has expired.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Without that
connection, all you have

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is a body of techniques
without the power of spirit.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:84%
When the Spanish
arrived to the Americas,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
they brought with
them a mythology

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that was uniquely different to
the mythologies of the Earth

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:90%
peoples.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was a
mythology that was

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
in conflict and contradictory
to the mythologies of the Earth

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:90%
peoples.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And let me go, for a moment,
into the mythic elements.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, the missionaries
brought with them

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:84%
a mythology that we
had been kicked out

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
of the garden, when none
of the American mythologies

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:90%
support this belief.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Native
Americans were not

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:90%
kicked out of the garden.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
They were given the garden to be
the stewards and the caretakers

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
of the garden.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So immediately that
created a hostility

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
between the conquistador
and the indigenous peoples.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Also the conquistadors
brought with them

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.764 align:middle line:84%
a belief that the Earth
was a hostile place.

00:15:02.764 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Because as we're being
cast out of the garden,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a voice that
says, and cursed

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
shall be the Earth
because of you, woman.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.302 align:middle line:84%
And to the man the voice says,
with the sweat of your back,

00:15:15.302 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
you will take your
fruit from the Earth,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and it shall grow thorns
and thistles for you.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say it shall grow
strawberries and mangoes

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and pineapples.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It shall grow
thorns and thistles.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So it establishes a hostile
relationship to the feminine

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:90%
and to the Earth.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And the traditions of the
peoples of the Americans

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
were the traditions
of the Earth peoples.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
They knew that it was from
the rich, fertile Earth

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:90%
that all life came from.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that it was--
that the Earth created

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
abundance, created-- produced
all of the foods and all

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.552 align:middle line:84%
the fruits that allowed us to
live in complete abundance.

00:15:58.552 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
with the conquest

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
is that the indigenous
peoples were decimated.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:84%
New studies indicate
that there were

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
over 100 million native
peoples living in the Americas

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%
at the time of the conquest.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the first 50 years,
90% of that population

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:84%
was decimated, primarily
by plagues, by small pox,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.744 align:middle line:84%
by illnesses that were
unknown in the Americas, that

00:16:26.744 --> 00:16:27.285 align:middle line:90%
contaminated.

00:16:27.285 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that
indicate that there

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
were over 100 million indigenous
people living in the Americas.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
50 years after the
conquest, their numbers

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:90%
had been reduced by 90%.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
The decimation that occurred in
the Americas, the genocide that

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
occurred was
unparalleled to anything

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
that had happened
previously, and would not

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
be parallel except
with the genocide that

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:90%
occurred in World War II.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
90 million Americans
decimated by small pox,

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:84%
by the illnesses
of the Europeans

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that were unknown
in the Americas,

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and for which the Native
Americans had no defenses for.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So the battle really occurred
in the healing chambers.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:84%
And Europeans, you have to
remember, were used to plagues.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
They had survived
the Black Plague.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They had survived
numerous plagues.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that when you
were struck by a plague,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:84%
you had to isolate
the individual,

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:84%
board them up in their
house, and protect

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the community.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:84%
In the Americas,
when you became ill,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
the tradition was that
the family sat around you.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The shaman would come and sing
and pray for the ill person.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So disease was communicated
very, very rapidly.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And it devastated the aboriginal
peoples of the Americas.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
What disease did not
do, the conquistadors

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
completed by converting
the indigenous peoples,

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:84%
decimating their mythology,
their religions, their belief

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.325 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
The conquistador arrived with
the notion of Heaven and Hell.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And they explained that Heaven
is, of course, the place above.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the place of the Holy.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the place of the Lord.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
When the indigenous
people asked where

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Hell was, which is a
very foreign notion

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:84%
to native peoples, they were
told that Hell was below.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It was the only other
direction that was left.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
inconceivable notion

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:84%
because the Native
Americans understood

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that it was from the
rich, fertile Earth

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that all life came forth,
that this could not

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
be the place of damnation.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Also very difficult
to understand

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
was the gender of
the European god,

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
that was a distinctly
masculine god.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So the decimation
was thorough, was

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the
population, of the culture,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.360 align:middle line:84%
of the religion,
of the traditions.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
In North America,
native peoples ended up

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:84%
being put in concentration
camps, where they still are,

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:90%
in reservations.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
In South America, they
were spared that fate.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
thorough decimation

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that drove the last of
the remaining shamans

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
into hiding in
mountaintops in the Andes

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
at 18,000 feet of
altitude, which

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
is where I met the shamans
that I have been working

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:90%
with the last 20 years.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The shamans that I had the
privilege of working with

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
understood that we have a
luminous energy field that

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
surrounds the
physical body and that

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
informs the physical body, that
organizes the physical body

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that the
energy fields of a magnet

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:84%
will organize iron filings
on a piece of glass.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And that you had to
intervene to heal

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:16.390 align:middle line:84%
the body at the level of
the luminous energy field,

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the blueprint.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
That if you only
intervened at the body,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:84%
through surgery or
medication, without clearing

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint, that
whatever condition

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.335 align:middle line:84%
you were suffering from
would re-express itself.

00:20:30.335 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:84%
The luminous energy
field is shaped

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:84%
like a doughnut, which,
in geometry, the shape is

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:90%
known as a torus.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's a doughnut with
a very narrow hole in it.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you can imagine
a flux of energy

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.120 align:middle line:84%
coming up through our
feet, through our bodies,

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
out the very top of
our head, and expanding

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
the width of our
outstretched arms,

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and there's energy flowing
up through the feet,

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
up to the legs, and down the
outside of the body again

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and then up again, and you
rotate that 360 degrees,

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:90%
you end up with a torus.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the shape of
the luminous energy

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:90%
field when we're in nature.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
When we're in a city,
this doughnut of energy

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
collapses and becomes
very, very tight,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:84%
like a cocoon, a
very tight cocoon

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:90%
around the physical body.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But where we're back in nature
or in our natural states,

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:90%
it's very expansive.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
This luminous
energy field is what

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:84%
contains the imprints of
our early life experiences,

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:84%
of genetically-inherited
illnesses,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
even of memories before we
were born, when we were still

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:90%
in the uterus and before.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to perceive
the luminous energy field,

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
we learn to perceive the
luminous nature of life.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
The visual spectrum,
what the eye can see,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
is a very narrow band of the
electromagnetic spectrum--

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:90%
very, very small.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Most of what's happening
in the universe

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
is happening outside
of the visual spectrum.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.350 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to perceive
with our inner eyes,

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:84%
with the eyes that can perceive
the luminous nature of life,

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
we recognize our
interconnectedness

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
with all things-- with the
stars, with the rivers,

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
with the mountains, with the
valleys, with each other,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
with the past, and
with our future.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
To perceive the
luminous energy field,

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
we have to part the
veil, so to speak.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
We need to break out of the
cultural trance that we've all

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
been educated
into, that defines,

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in a very narrow and limited
way, the nature of reality,

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that defines what you can and
cannot do because you were born

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
a woman, what I can or may not
experience because I was born

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:90%
a man.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:84%
That prescribes
who we are, scripts

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
who we are, at this
moment in history--

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:84%
we have to step out
of the cultural trance

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that we begin to learn
from kindergarten on.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
The luminous energy
field becomes toxic.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:84%
When we experience
toxic emotions

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that we're not able to
process or cleanse ourselves

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:84%
from effectively, they begin to
build within our luminous field

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
like sludge, pools of sludge,
that begin to weaken us,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to debilitate us, to slow
down the flow of the energy

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.385 align:middle line:84%
streams in our field, to
make us lethargic, to make

00:23:35.385 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
us unconscious, and eventually
to make us-- to deaden us.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an
example of this.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a woman a few
years ago who came to see me.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Her son had died, her
only son, on November 26.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And every November 26, she would
have a near-death experience.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:84%
She had let her son go out
with friends, borrow the car.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
They had gotten into
an automobile accident.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And she felt completely
responsible for his death.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Every November 26, she would
be in a close call with death.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
One time, she was
stopped at a red light,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and a truck rear-ended her.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
She ended up in
the emergency room.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Another November 26, she
was eating at a restaurant

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and became poisoned by
the fish she was eating,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.190 align:middle line:84%
had to be rushed
to the hospital.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
In the emergency room, they
gave her barium to do an exam,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and found out that she
was allergic to barium

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.309 align:middle line:90%
when her heart stopped.

00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And when she came to see
me-- and the third time,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:90%
she didn't even leave the house.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
that she was plugging

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
a lamp in and nearly
electrocuted herself.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So she asked me,
Alberto, how can

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
an imprint in the
luminous energy field

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.090 align:middle line:84%
be choreographing my
getting rear-ended,

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
my getting food
poisoning-- events

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:90%
that are outside of my world?

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And the luminous energy
field organizes our reality.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
It will choreograph
our life experience

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
to recreate the circumstances
of an original wounding

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
to give us an
opportunity to heal.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the time, we're
not able to heal that situation

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
by recreating a
near-death experience.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
She was not able to heal her
grieving and her mourning

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:90%
for the loss of her son.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it kept rewounding
her, strengthening the imprint

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:90%
in the field.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was not until we did
an illumination process, which

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is our core healing
process, that we were

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:84%
able to clear the
imprint in the field

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and reinform her luminous
energy field-- erase

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
this imprint so she could then
carry on with her mourning,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and the grieving,
and the healing

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:90%
from the loss of her son.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:84%
The way an imprint
works is that if you

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
do not to learn the lessons,
if you do not heal them,

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:90%
you end up marrying them.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
A case that illustrates
this is a client

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:84%
who came to see me who had had
seven significant relationships

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:90%
in her young life, 31 years old.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And she found that
they all ended up

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.490 align:middle line:84%
in the same tragic
matter, through betrayal,

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:20.351 align:middle line:84%
the man was cheating
on her, through loss.

00:26:20.351 --> 00:26:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And she had an imprint in
her luminous energy field

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that we shrouded around
this theme of abandonment

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.384 align:middle line:90%
and betrayal.

00:26:28.384 --> 00:26:30.675 align:middle line:84%
What she realized in the
course of her healing is, see,

00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:84%
she had had really
only one relationship,

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
but with seven different men--
the same relationship repeating

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
she healed and cleared

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:84%
this imprint that she was able
to have a wholesome and healthy

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:84%
relationship with a man who did
not get set up to betray her,

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:84%
to act out the programming and
in this imprint in her field.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
An imprint is caused by trauma
that is unhealed at the moment.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we have trauma
that we do not resolve and heal

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, it begins
to organize energies

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.920 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a
blueprint, if you want,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of a fingerprint in the
luminous energy field.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:90%
It becomes encoded in our field.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It has to charge that is
not released in the moment,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and that is this
charge that's carried

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:90%
within the cocoon of our field.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
It begins to embed itself
to the walls of the field

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.115 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a
permanent fixture--

00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:84%
this charge not only
contains energy,

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
but it also contains information
about the circumstances

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:90%
around the original wounding.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So whenever this
imprint gets triggered,

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
that information will spill
into one of our chakras

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and take over our
central nervous system.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:84%
It will hijack our
central nervous system

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and recreate the circumstances
of the original wounding again.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:23.470 align:middle line:84%
An original wounding can
be caused by child abuse,

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
whether verbal or
physical, by a sense

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.410 align:middle line:84%
of being left in the
world and the world

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:90%
suddenly stopping to be safe.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Parents might leave a
child to go on a holiday

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and leave the
child with Grandma,

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:47.800 align:middle line:84%
but the child feels that
she has been abandoned.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's all
subjective, of course.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And that can begin
to shape and form

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
an imprint which will
continue to bear itself

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
true throughout that person's
life until they heal it.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.265 align:middle line:84%
So trauma, sometimes
this trauma--

00:29:04.265 --> 00:29:06.056 align:middle line:84%
it's always the early
life or intrauterine.

00:29:06.056 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally it's
previous lives-- the way

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
we may have died in a
former lifetime, which

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
becomes imprinted and coded
into our luminous field,

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and again continues to
recreate that theme, which

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
may not necessarily prescribe
the way that we might die now,

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.170 align:middle line:84%
but prescribes the way that
we might experience loss

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:90%
or we might experience hurt.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an example
from my own life of what

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
happens when an
imprint is activated.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a
Latin American country,

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
revolution happening

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:90%
when I was 10 years old.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:84%
At that time, we were
terrified that somebody

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.130 align:middle line:84%
might come and break
into our house.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:84%
There were militiamen
all over the streets.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:90%
We had locks on our doors.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And when my father, who was gone
during the day, was not there,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I was the only man in the
house, a 10-year-old little boy,

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.060 align:middle line:84%
that had to look after my
mother and my grandmother

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and my sister.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So I was terrified.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
One time, three militiamen
came to the door, they knocked.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:90%
We would not open the door.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:90%
They started kicking it in.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the window, and
I pulled the curtain aside

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and I looked out, and I saw
one of the militiamen who

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:90%
saw this terrified little boy.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I looked into his eyes, and
he turned to the others,

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:90%
and he said, "Come.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no one here.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's go."

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:90%
He saved-- he saved us.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:90%
He saved my life.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened is that I--
it was such a traumatic moment

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:84%
for me because I knew that
not only could I have died,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:84%
but my family could
have been killed.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
That the people that
would come to help me

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and to my assistance,
I understood

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:84%
were also the people that
could hurt me the most.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.910 align:middle line:84%
That became encoded as
an imprint in my life.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So for many years, I was unable
to develop close friendships,

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.057 align:middle line:84%
to let anyone too
close or help me

00:31:21.057 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that they were
the people that could take

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:84%
my family away, that
could hurt me the most.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I was unable to enter into
an intimate relationship

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:84%
because if I let
someone in, they

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:90%
could take everything away.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And I spent years
in psychotherapy,

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and I understood the
dynamics perfectly well--

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:84%
tremendous insight
into my own pathology,

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
but I could not break
free of the pattern.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I could not allow intimacy
or close friendships.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
cleared this imprint

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.810 align:middle line:84%
from my luminous
field that I was

00:31:53.810 --> 00:32:02.170 align:middle line:84%
able to find people that
could assist me and help me,

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:90%
and that I could also help.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Because prior to that, I
was a compulsive helper.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I was always providing
assistance to others,

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
but there was no
one there for me.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So after my own healing, I
was able to suddenly open up

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and to receive.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Imprints are the
cause of disease.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Whereas medicine says
that physical disease

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:84%
results from genetic
predispositions

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that you have for heart disease,
for example, or a breast

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.570 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
What we would say is
that these conditions

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:84%
are informed by patterns
in your luminous field.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And that if you heal the pattern
before it has the opportunity

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to express itself as
a heart condition,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:90%
then you do not have to live it.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:57.140 align:middle line:90%
You do not have to live it out.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So from the world
view of the healer,

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.220 align:middle line:84%
the information in the
luminous energy field

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:90%
is the cause of illness.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.760 align:middle line:84%
It's that genetic blueprint that
is energetic-- not molecular,

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
like we think the genetic
blueprint exists exclusively.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the
luminous energy field

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that informs DNA that then
informs the physical body.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So the implications here
are that we can not only

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:35.020 align:middle line:84%
heal disease that we may
have inherited genetically,

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.060 align:middle line:84%
but that we can
consciously influence

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the expression of our genes and
participate in our evolution.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:84%
We can create new bodies
that age differently,

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that heal differently,
and that die differently.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The traditions that
we work are traditions

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:84%
in which an individual
learns that they

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
can dream with their eyes open,
so that the dream time not been

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:07.721 align:middle line:84%
stuffed into this domain of
sleep like it has in the West.

00:34:07.721 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we live
in the dream time.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:90%
We dream the world into being.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:18.000 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that we are
able to create and craft

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
a new body that
ages differently,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:84%
we're able to create and craft
and dream a world into being,

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:84%
a personal world, in which we
live in harmony with nature,

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves,
with our families.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:38.766 align:middle line:84%
We're able to interact with the
organizing principles of life

00:34:38.766 --> 00:34:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and actually participate
in the process of creation.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.239 align:middle line:84%
When we don't dream
our world into being,

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:49.780 align:middle line:84%
we have to settle for a
dream that was dreamt for us

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.170 align:middle line:84%
by the culture that says
that this is what you're

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.580 align:middle line:90%
capable of doing as a woman.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
These are the life
experiences you're

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.660 align:middle line:90%
capable of having as a man.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:84%
This is how long it takes
to heal from this condition.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:84%
It takes 30 days
to heal from this.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you're able
to dream in the sense

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that we speak of
dreaming, you're

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:84%
able to break out
of a cultural trance

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.832 align:middle line:84%
that we've all been
educated into that scripts

00:35:20.832 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and prescribes the
nature of reality,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.140 align:middle line:84%
generally in a very
narrow and limiting way.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Shamans don't
diagnose, they heal.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.470 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we
diagnose, and then we

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:84%
have prescribed
interventions that

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:84%
have to be performed in
exactly the same way,

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:84%
regardless of who
has the diagnosis.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Chronic fatigue is widespread
throughout America,

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and it is intimately connected
to our disassociation

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.980 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.250 align:middle line:84%
The more we connect with
nature and with our own nature,

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:84%
the more that we are able
to be replenished by sources

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that are not limited
to ourselves.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:84%
We're able to come into a
fuller energetic exchange

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth and
with the environment.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is a condition that is
very readily-- responds very

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:90%
well to energy medicine.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.745 align:middle line:84%
The chakras are the organs
of the luminous energy field.

00:36:29.745 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that we have
physical organs in the body,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
we have luminous organs
in our energy field.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.615 align:middle line:84%
And they are vortexes
of energy that

00:36:38.615 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:84%
spin in a clockwise direction
that are shaped like a funnel.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And the wide mouth of the funnel
extends two or three inches

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.820 align:middle line:84%
outside our body, whereas
the narrow tip of the funnel

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:84%
extends into the body
and connects directly

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:90%
to the spinal cord.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So the chakras inform our
neurophysiology directly.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you have the
information in an imprint, when

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:84%
it's triggered, it's activated,
it spills its contents

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:84%
into a chakra that then informs
our central nervous system

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It hijacks our central
nervous system.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you
have a computer,

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.302 align:middle line:84%
you have a small icon
in your computer,

00:37:25.302 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's only when
you double-click on it

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that that icon takes
over your screen.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, imprints remain dormant
in the luminous energy field

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:41.140 align:middle line:90%
until they get double-clicked.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
do, they hijack

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.600 align:middle line:90%
our central nervous system.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And they get double-clicked
when our buttons get pushed,

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.320 align:middle line:84%
when we get
emotionally triggered,

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.640 align:middle line:90%
when we become reactive in life.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:84%
When we become reactive,
it's a sure sign

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that there's an imprint that
has taken over and it's at play.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.510 align:middle line:90%
We lose consciousness.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer in
the driver's seat.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I no longer see you, but I
see a version of my mother.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I no longer see this man, but I
see the father that I never had

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:90%
and that I'm jealous of.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So we begin to project
our internal reality out

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:26.230 align:middle line:84%
into the world, onto innocent
people that have simply

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:84%
triggered an unconscious
program in us.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
People ask me, do Native
Americans have chakras?

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the
chakras were Hindu.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And I ask them, well, do
Africans have kidneys?

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
kidneys were European.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course chakras are
part of our luminous anatomy,

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and they're universal.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And each of the chakras has
a theme associated with it.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But in our system, in
the Native Americas,

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:84%
we work with nine
chakras, seven of which

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.260 align:middle line:84%
are within the
physical body, one,

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.870 align:middle line:84%
the eighth chakra is
within the luminous body

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:14.220 align:middle line:84%
but outside the physical
body, and the ninth chakra

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
is completely outside
the physical body

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.030 align:middle line:90%
and the luminous body.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's at the center
of the universe.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's that notion that
we call God in the West.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So the themes, very
briefly, of the chakras,

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.750 align:middle line:84%
are the first one is
associated with survival,

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:34.530 align:middle line:84%
self-preservation--
groundedness, connection,

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:90%
to the feminine, to the Earth.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a chakra that is
atrophied for many, many of us

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:90%
in the West.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Our connection to nature, to
be sustained by the Earth,

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
by the mother who
will never leave us.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So we go about
addressing these needs

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.110 align:middle line:90%
in a very materialistic way.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.520 align:middle line:84%
You're never going
to have enough money.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to
have enough security.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.550 align:middle line:84%
These are the themes
that we can heal

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:04.690 align:middle line:84%
by reestablishing our connection
to the Earth that provides

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:84%
all of that we need so
that we live in abundance.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Some of the poorest
people I know

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.480 align:middle line:84%
are worth hundreds of
millions of dollars

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.330 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
that sustaining connection

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.420 align:middle line:90%
to the Mother.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.660 align:middle line:84%
The second chakra is
related to our sense

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.600 align:middle line:84%
of self, our sexuality,
our emotions,

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:90%
our personal identity.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:35.210 align:middle line:84%
The third chakra, which is
located at the solar plexus,

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:39.600 align:middle line:84%
is associated with how
the world receives us,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
how we're able to express
ourselves in the world,

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and manifest our
dreams in the world.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:90%
The fourth chakra is the heart.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.636 align:middle line:84%
It's associated with
the higher emotions,

00:40:52.636 --> 00:40:58.260 align:middle line:84%
with love, with
freedom, with intimacy.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And sexuality is associated
with the second chakra.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Intimacy doesn't
happen until you

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.715 align:middle line:84%
are able to awaken
the fourth chakra.

00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So in much of our culture,
we see a sexuality devoid

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:90%
of love, devoid of intimacy.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.440 align:middle line:84%
The fifth chakra, the
throat, is the place

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.100 align:middle line:84%
where our psychic and
intuitive abilities reside.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And it creates-- its the
honeycomb, if you would,

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that expresses our
dreams in the world.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And this honeycomb,
this latticework

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:84%
provided by the fifth chakra,
is fueled by the third chakra

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
to achieve our
dreams in the world,

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:53.850 align:middle line:84%
to have the world respond to us
in a creative and positive way.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.680 align:middle line:84%
The sixth chakra at the
forehead is associated

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:02.111 align:middle line:84%
with our experience of
our personal divine,

00:42:02.111 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:84%
of the awakened
mind, of the ability

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to see into the
heart of things--

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.570 align:middle line:84%
just perceive the luminous
connections with life.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the fully
awakened sense of self.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.190 align:middle line:84%
The individual who
has fully-- who

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:84%
has become whole, who as
matured, who has individuated,

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.900 align:middle line:84%
the seventh chakra, at
the very top of the head,

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.139 align:middle line:84%
is our connection
with the heavens.

00:42:33.139 --> 00:42:35.013 align:middle line:84%
The same way that the
first chakra connect us

00:42:35.013 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, the seventh
chakra connects us to the sun,

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to the heavens, to the
source of all life.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.660 align:middle line:84%
The eighth chakra
is above our heads,

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:54.215 align:middle line:84%
and is depicted as a radiant
sun that washes us in its light

00:42:54.215 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and in its beauty.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:02.300 align:middle line:84%
This is a chakra that
exists outside of time.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:84%
All of the seven chakras in
our body manifest in time.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.710 align:middle line:84%
The eighth chakra
exists outside of time.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we die, this
eighth chakra expands.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It becomes like a
luminous-- a golden egg,

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and the seven chakras migrate
up to this eighth chakra,

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes about
creating a new body.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the primary job
of this eighth chakra.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And the eighth chakra is the
personal experience of God.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It's where God lives within us.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The ninth chakra, which is also
outside of time and outside

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:43.340 align:middle line:84%
of space, is where
we live within God.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It's what we would call spirit.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.120 align:middle line:84%
The eighth chakra would be
the soul, which is personal.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the ninth
chakra is spirit, which is one.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:84%
When the energy field,
the luminous energy field

00:43:54.750 --> 00:44:00.990 align:middle line:84%
becomes toxic, we are not
able to recycle waste.

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:04.862 align:middle line:84%
And then the chakras
become clogged.

00:44:04.862 --> 00:44:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The chakras, remember,
metabolize energy,

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and feed us and sustain us
in a very essential way.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So that when the luminous
system becomes clogged,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:84%
the quality of the field
going into our chakras

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.680 align:middle line:84%
is very, very low very
low-- very low grade fuel.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So we become dull, our
energy levels drop,

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:84%
we begin to experience
mood swings,

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:84%
psychosomatic conditions
get triggered,

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and actually genetic
imprints can be activated.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You can have twins, two
sisters, both of which

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:43.710 align:middle line:84%
inherited a predisposition
to breast cancer.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And one sister, with
the toxic field,

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:90%
will have expressed that cancer.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:54.660 align:middle line:84%
The one who has a clean luminous
body, the one that is not

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:84%
toxic, will not have
expressed that condition.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Because these toxins
in the luminous field

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:05.520 align:middle line:84%
overloaded our
immune system and can

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.880 align:middle line:84%
catalyze the expression
of degraded conditions.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.910 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we
have a toxic field?

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally, it's
depression, mood swings.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Physically, is a lack of
vital energy, an inability

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to sleep well, an inability to
absorb nourishment from food,

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and the expression of disease
that would not have expressed

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.920 align:middle line:84%
itself had we maintained
our luminous energy

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.450 align:middle line:90%
field in good health.

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The shaman works with
four levels of reality,

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.810 align:middle line:84%
by engaging four
levels of reality.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
briefly describe these.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
the literal level,

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.070 align:middle line:90%
the level of matter of the body.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.310 align:middle line:90%
The second one is the symbolic.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.270 align:middle line:90%
We can call it the mind.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:04.290 align:middle line:84%
The third is the mythic,
that we could call the soul.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth is the essential,
that we could call the spirit.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Each of these are like
Russian nesting dolls that

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:16.890 align:middle line:84%
sit inside each other and that
inform the levels within it

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we know that the
mind informs the body,

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.460 align:middle line:84%
the soul informs the mind, and
the spirit informs the soul.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.360 align:middle line:90%


00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Each of these domains
has its own language.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:34.390 align:middle line:84%
The language of the body is
physical, chemical, cellular.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:38.530 align:middle line:84%
The language of
the mind are words.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The language of the
soul are images.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And the language of
spirit is energy.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The gift of the healer
is to be able to engage

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:57.335 align:middle line:84%
each of these levels separately,
to not be confined to one.

00:46:57.335 --> 00:46:59.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, medicine
operates strictly

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:01.350 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the
body, psychology

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the mind.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual teachings of
the level of the soul.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And the very deep
spiritual teaching

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.960 align:middle line:90%
is at the level of spirit.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The healer, and the healers
that we're training in the West,

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.050 align:middle line:84%
learn how to switch
levels of engagement

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.080 align:middle line:84%
so that if you're
working with a client

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and they have a pending
engagement with a heart

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:84%
condition because
they inherited it

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:84%
from their mother and
their grandmother,

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.710 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to have that
encounter at the literal level,

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:36.450 align:middle line:90%
in the emergency room.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:40.960 align:middle line:84%
You preferably want to have
it at the psychological

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.520 align:middle line:84%
or preferably at the
level of the soul,

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.720 align:middle line:84%
ideally at the
energetic, where you're

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.350 align:middle line:84%
able to clear the imprint
in the luminous energy field

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:54.770 align:middle line:84%
before it has an opportunity
to organize disease.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So the shaman healer is able
to work at all four levels.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The psychologist generally
works only at the level of mind.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And the tools of
the psychologist

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.780 align:middle line:90%
are language and feelings.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.990 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is able to work
at the level of the soul.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The tools of the
level of the soul

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:21.500 align:middle line:84%
are images, archetypical images
that are laden with power.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Not just with information,
but with power.

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And the language of spirit,
of course, is not even images.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The language of
spirit is energy,

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:84%
which is the most
fundamental language of all.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:40.350 align:middle line:84%
There are dangers associated
with energy medicine,

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and these are dangers
that are seldom

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.080 align:middle line:90%
pointed out by practitioners.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I've had many people
come to my office

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:52.630 align:middle line:84%
after they have seen an energy
healer who has applied energy

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to their cancer only
to have their cancer

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.730 align:middle line:84%
metastasize
throughout their body.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.685 align:middle line:90%
Because cancer loves energy.

00:48:59.685 --> 00:49:01.090 align:middle line:90%
It loves blood flow.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.390 align:middle line:90%
It loves energy.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot practice energy
healing by treating the symptom

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.570 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
very, very careful.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
These are extraordinarily
powerful processes

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that can disinhibit
the immune response

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:19.640 align:middle line:84%
or it can accelerate
the regrowth

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.770 align:middle line:90%
of a cancer in the body.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:26.126 align:middle line:84%
So there are cautions that
the healers must be aware of,

00:49:26.126 --> 00:49:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and that during the course
of your training, as you

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.400 align:middle line:84%
experience the power
of these practices,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.460 align:middle line:84%
you become very sensitive
to their appropriate use.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.440 align:middle line:84%
There are four
modalities of healing

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that we work with in
four distinct processes.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.090 align:middle line:84%
The first one is the
illumination process.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the core
healing process.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
clearing and erasing

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.330 align:middle line:84%
imprints in the
luminous energy field

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and assisting your
client in having

00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:02.370 align:middle line:84%
an experience of infinity,
of stepping outside of time,

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:07.460 align:middle line:84%
of their infinite nature,
of this eighth chakra that

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.100 align:middle line:84%
exists outside of
the physical body.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.220 align:middle line:84%
The illumination
process erases imprints

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:19.430 align:middle line:84%
from the luminous energy
field, clears the chakras,

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.120 align:middle line:84%
metabolizes toxic
energies in the chakras

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.920 align:middle line:84%
so that we can vibrate again
in our original frequencies,

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.060 align:middle line:90%
in our original nature.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.268 align:middle line:84%
We can acquire
that rainbow body.

00:50:30.268 --> 00:50:34.780 align:middle line:84%
The second process is working
with intrusive energies

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.250 align:middle line:90%
or entities.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.990 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we assume that
all of the energies that we

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:90%
experience belong to us.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.910 align:middle line:84%
In traditional
societies, the healer

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:46.600 align:middle line:84%
understands that
there are energies

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that do not belong
to you, that these

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:53.510 align:middle line:84%
are intrusive energies,
and, in some cases,

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:59.530 align:middle line:84%
intrusive entities that do
not belong to your client.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.700 align:middle line:84%
There are two kinds
of intrusive energies.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.585 align:middle line:84%
The first one is thought forms
directed at you-- someone that

00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:11.140 align:middle line:84%
feels that you've hurt them,
that you've betrayed them.

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.630 align:middle line:84%
That when you feel that you've
been stabbed in the back

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.670 align:middle line:90%
by someone.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are
generally individuals

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.840 align:middle line:84%
that we were once close
to-- that young man

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.600 align:middle line:84%
or that young woman
that feels that you

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.710 align:middle line:84%
left them and destroyed
their lives because you

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.940 align:middle line:90%
were the love of their life.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The resentment and the
anger that they feel

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.490 align:middle line:84%
can penetrate our
luminous defenses

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:39.920 align:middle line:84%
because we do not
recognize them as foreign.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.920 align:middle line:84%
These are people that we
were once very open to,

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.980 align:middle line:90%
that we let in very deeply.

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And these energies can
actually embed themselves

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:52.960 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body and become
crystallized and hardened.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And in the jungles,
for example, they

00:51:54.940 --> 00:52:00.100 align:middle line:84%
describe these as
spears or arrows, darts,

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:04.970 align:middle line:84%
psychic darts that embed
themselves in the body

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and then begin to
transmit their poison,

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:17.770 align:middle line:84%
which is generally in the
form of anger or rage or fear.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Anger and fear-- the two most
deadly poisons in the world.

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have to extract
these energies manually.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.850 align:middle line:84%
They have to be pulled
out of the physical body.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:90%
So this an intrusive energy.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.620 align:middle line:84%
An intrusive entity
is a spirit that

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:84%
has become attached to someone
and that begins to inform them.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The person begins to assume
the behaviors, the postures,

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:56.660 align:middle line:84%
the addictions, the cravings
of the deceased person.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, curiously, we're
finding this also happening

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.050 align:middle line:90%
with organ transplants.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's received a kidney
or a heart-lung transplant

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.030 align:middle line:84%
who's never had any
craving for alcohol

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:13.250 align:middle line:84%
suddenly begins to crave
alcohol, or to crave meat,

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:90%
or to crave smoking.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But what happens with
an intrusive entity

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:29.070 align:middle line:84%
is that 99% of the time it's a
relative who died unconsciously

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and who is gravitating
to a loved one

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.760 align:middle line:90%
to seek help and assistance.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.263 align:middle line:84%
And even the relative that you
like the least, if they came

00:53:38.263 --> 00:53:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to your front door
bloodied from an accident,

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.200 align:middle line:84%
you would let them
in long enough

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.220 align:middle line:84%
to clean them out and then
invite them out again.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.130 align:middle line:84%
What happens when an
individual dies unconsciously

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is that they're trapped
between the worlds.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.920 align:middle line:84%
They're caught in a nightmare
that they can't wake up from.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And they will gravitate to a
loved one-- not necessarily

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:03.420 align:middle line:84%
the most loved one, but the
most psychically open one,

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the most spiritually
open person,

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:10.806 align:middle line:84%
and they'll take up
residence with them.

00:54:10.806 --> 00:54:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:17.810 align:middle line:84%
When "Shaman, Healer, Sage"
was about to go to press,

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:21.080 align:middle line:84%
the publisher, Random
House, flew me to New York,

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and they invited me to give
a presentation to their sales

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:26.820 align:middle line:84%
force-- the national
sales force.

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:30.260 align:middle line:84%
My talk was after
lunch, and they were not

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.890 align:middle line:84%
very interested in
a book on healing.

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:37.350 align:middle line:84%
They were really looking for
the next best-selling novel.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And then a man
walks into the room,

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and I see that everyone wakes
up and is looking to him

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to see how they should
react to this book.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And he raises his hand and
addresses the sales force.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you all
know that I generally

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.960 align:middle line:90%
do not come to these meetings.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But all of you know that
for the last 10 years,

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I've had a problem with alcohol.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I went to see one
of Alberto's graduates,

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and I had two healing
sessions with her.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was three
and a half months ago.

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've not have a
drop of alcohol since,

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.640 align:middle line:90%
nor any craving for alcohol.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.260 align:middle line:90%
This really works.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And he gets up and he
leaves, and suddenly everyone

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:20.970 align:middle line:84%
is interested because just
about everyone in publishing

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:24.270 align:middle line:84%
in New York has a
problem with alcohol.

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I called our
graduate, and I asked her,

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:90%
what did you do with this man?

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, when
he walked in to see me,

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.640 align:middle line:90%
he walked in the door.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Right behind him was
his father's spirit.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:42.450 align:middle line:84%
His father had died
10 years earlier.

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:46.370 align:middle line:84%
His father had been an
alcoholic all his life

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and had been with her
client, with this man,

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:53.290 align:middle line:90%
for the last 10 years.

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:54.630 align:middle line:90%
And I asked, what did you do?

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:57.310 align:middle line:90%
She said I helped him die.

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:59.230 align:middle line:90%
I helped him to die.

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.490 align:middle line:84%
The minute that he
disengaged from the client,

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.110 align:middle line:90%
he was able to stop drinking.

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was my editor's
boss's boss's boss.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- it was some big angel
that sent this man into this

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:18.450 align:middle line:90%
meeting.

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:20.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's powerful.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:26.275 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I speak about this
to, say, in psychology meetings

00:56:26.275 --> 00:56:27.960 align:middle line:84%
or in medical
meetings, everybody

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.770 align:middle line:84%
begins to cringe a
little bit because this

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.030 align:middle line:90%
is a taboo subject.

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:34.100 align:middle line:90%
You don't talk about this.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.334 align:middle line:84%
But there's no amount
of psychotherapy,

00:56:36.334 --> 00:56:37.750 align:middle line:84%
there's no amount
of medicine that

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:44.480 align:middle line:84%
is going to help when you have
an intrusive energy or spirit

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.095 align:middle line:90%
causing disease in your client.

00:56:49.095 --> 00:56:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the interventions that
we work with energetically

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:53.720 align:middle line:90%
are tremendously effective.

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we not only want
to extract the spirit that

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:58.900 align:middle line:84%
could be uncle
Martin, but we want

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to assist him in his crossing--
help him to die consciously,

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.856 align:middle line:84%
help him be received with
love and with compassion,

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:08.850 align:middle line:90%
and be filled with light.

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:13.480 align:middle line:84%
The third process we work with
is the soul retrieval process.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:18.081 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of these are founded
on the illumination process,

00:57:18.081 --> 00:57:22.290 align:middle line:84%
on clearing imprints from
the luminous energy field.

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.800 align:middle line:84%
The soul retrieval
process, in which

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.720 align:middle line:84%
the healer journeys
on behalf of a client

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to help them recover
a soul part that

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:36.720 align:middle line:84%
was lost as a result
of trauma or pain,

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.960 align:middle line:84%
the soul retrieval
can accomplish

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.670 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of
sessions what can take

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.770 align:middle line:90%
years to do in psychotherapy.

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Where in psychotherapy you're
retrieving the understanding

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:84%
of why this happened,
how it happened.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.460 align:middle line:84%
In soul retrieval,
you're actually

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.210 align:middle line:84%
recovering a quanta of energy,
a vital life force-- not

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:59.700 align:middle line:84%
the information, but the
energy and reinstalling

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that as essential resources
that your clients need in order

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.110 align:middle line:90%
to heal.

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:09.530 align:middle line:84%
You're retrieving the energy and
reinstalling it in the client

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:13.730 align:middle line:84%
psyche, transmitting
it to the client.

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:15.890 align:middle line:84%
There are two kinds
of soul retrieval

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.010 align:middle line:84%
that we teach our
students to work with.

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:22.740 align:middle line:84%
The first one is journeying
along the client's timeline

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:28.310 align:middle line:84%
into the past to discover
an original wound.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And the premise here
is that every wound

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that we have had in our
lives-- every time that we've

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.460 align:middle line:84%
experienced suffering
or pain-- has

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.760 align:middle line:84%
been a replay of
this original wound.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It's been version number 27
of this original wounding.

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:47.310 align:middle line:84%
In our mythology,
of course, this

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is described as
our original sin.

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But individually, there's
also an original wounding

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:00.290 align:middle line:84%
that the shaman is able to
travel back along timeline,

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:04.480 align:middle line:90%
identify, and help heal.

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.420 align:middle line:84%
The second kind
of soul retrieval

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:10.100 align:middle line:84%
is where we travel
forward along a timeline

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and do a destiny retrieval,
where our students

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.640 align:middle line:84%
learn to work with
the client to help

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:21.770 align:middle line:90%
them access a future state.

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It might be a
future healed state,

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:31.200 align:middle line:84%
or it might be a state in which
they have reinvented themselves

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.280 align:middle line:84%
in a creative positive
engagement with life.

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
I write a new book,

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I do a destiny retrieval.

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I track time forward,
access the complete book

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:47.100 align:middle line:84%
so it can begin
informing me now.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a story
that illustrates this,

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
powerful teaching tool that

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:56.160 align:middle line:84%
is relatively
unknown in the West.

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I had a client who was a
physicist at the Stanford

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Linear Accelerator.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were studying
the age of the universe.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.950 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
determine if there

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
was enough mass in
the universe for it

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:15.770 align:middle line:84%
to continue expanding
forever or if it

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:18.620 align:middle line:84%
was going to begin
to collapse back

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.400 align:middle line:84%
onto itself in a kind
of reverse Big Bang.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
important information.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:30.550 align:middle line:84%
We're fascinated by the
questions of this sort.

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And he calls me a few
months after I met him,

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:36.996 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him, Steve, what's
the prognosis for the universe?

01:00:36.996 --> 01:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
it looks good.

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:41.540 align:middle line:84%
It looks like there is
enough mass for the universe

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.590 align:middle line:90%
to continue expanding forever.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But the prognosis is
not so good for me.

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I've just been diagnosed with
stage four terminal cancer.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've been given
four months to live.

01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So he described a condition
in which 98% of the people

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.620 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with this illness
died within four months.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So we had to track
through that 2% window

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to find the future
healed state that

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:16.130 align:middle line:90%
could begin to inform him now.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, his body
was being informed exclusively

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
by this diseased state.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:25.660 align:middle line:90%
So we did a destiny retrieval.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
After working together
for two months,

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
we were able to access
the future healed state

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.020 align:middle line:90%
where Steve was disease-free.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And eight months
later, I ended up

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.220 align:middle line:90%
marrying him to his new bride.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And he outlived his prognosis
by more than 10 years.

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's a group
of Hopi elders

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
that sit in
meditation envisioning

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
the possible healed
state for the Earth.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Not the probable
healed state-- we

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
know what the
probable state will

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
be-- but the possible one,
no matter how improbable.

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
the act of seeing it

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
helps to make it a
little bit more probable.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.700 align:middle line:84%
The fourth healing
process that we work with

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
are the death rites,
which we have largely

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:17.740 align:middle line:90%
forgotten in the West.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:21.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no greater gift that
you can give to a loved one--

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.070 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the person who
brought you into this world--

01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
than to assist them in
their greatest journey.

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And the death rites
allow us to be

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
an island of calm in
the middle of a storm.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It is the most
terrifying thing that

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.070 align:middle line:84%
can happened to someone
who's not prepared,

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and very few of us
learn the practices

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of stillness and
surrender and love

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that are required for
us to die consciously.

01:02:55.050 --> 01:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So the death rites assist
us in helping a loved one

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:02.980 align:middle line:90%
to make their journey across.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And they have to do with
learning to disengage

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
the luminous energy field so
that the luminous body does not

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
remain attached to the
physical body after death,

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and learning to seal the chakras
so the luminous body cannot

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.450 align:middle line:90%
reenter the physical body.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And in assisting our
loved one in coming

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
to peace with their life
history through the illumination

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
process-- illuminating
each one of the chakras

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.700 align:middle line:84%
so that they are not held in
bondage by any of the pain

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
inflicted upon them
in the past or pain

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that they may have inadvertently
inflicted on others.

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So that there's no
karma that's been left.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The death rites are
essential to us in the West.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember when my
father was passing.

01:03:56.070 --> 01:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
He was in the hospital,
and he was in a coma.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And my sister and I had gone to
the cafeteria for a sandwich.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
When we came back, his
vital signs had stopped.

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And a young priest
was there performing

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
the Catholic last
rites, where you

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
make the sign of the cross
over each of the chakras.

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I walk into the
room and I'm horrified.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And I take the priest and
I usher him out the door.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I lock the door, and I
disengage my father's chakras,

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
one by one, beginning
at the heart,

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and then help his
luminous body separate

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:37.630 align:middle line:90%
from his physical body.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
My mother and my sister
were crying, were in tears.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
As soon as his luminous body
separated from the physical,

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
we all began to laugh in joy.

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The room changed from a
hospital room into a cathedral.

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we went and
sealed the chakras,

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
the same way the
priest was doing,

01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
but after we set the
luminous body free.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the priest had forgotten
the origin of these rites,

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and was actually
sealing that luminous

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.110 align:middle line:90%
body in the physical body.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Death is a natural process.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies know how
to die in the same way

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
that we know how to be born.

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you're having
a natural childbirth,

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
you preferably want to do
it in a hospital, where

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.830 align:middle line:84%
in case something
goes wrong, you

01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:28.200 align:middle line:90%
have access to medical help.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
That one out of 10, that
doesn't happen naturally.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Similarly with the death rites.

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Nine out of 10
people die gracefully

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and are able to journey through
the axis of the luminous energy

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
field, the center
of that doughnut,

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.870 align:middle line:90%
back to the world of spirit.

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's that one out of 10
that you want to be able to be

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
present for so that they are
not caught in this realm between

01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the worlds, in the nightmare
that they cannot wake up from.

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So that they're
able to journey back

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
into the light in
a loving manner.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
These are the four
key processes,

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
but they all happen within the
context of the illumination

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
process, of the
experience of infinity.

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Until we're able to
honor our ancestors,

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.875 align:middle line:84%
they continue to
live through us.

01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:20.500 align:middle line:90%


01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So we need to elevate them and
put them in the ancestral altar

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.940 align:middle line:84%
so that they're not running
loose around our lives

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and wreaking havoc in them.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And we do that by
elevating them--

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.136 align:middle line:84%
by remembering them in the
way that they would have liked

01:06:37.136 --> 01:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
us to remember them,
not only in the way

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
they hurt us or
they traumatized us.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, we
heal the ancestor wound,

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and we assist them in
continuing in their journey

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.280 align:middle line:90%
back to the spirit world.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.665 align:middle line:84%
We do not keep them bound
to us and to possible pain

01:06:53.665 --> 01:06:55.920 align:middle line:90%
that they experience with us.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.250 align:middle line:90%
We set them free.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
In setting them free,
we set ourselves

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
free as well, so
that we do not need

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.290 align:middle line:90%
to continue living their lives.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I do not need to live my
father's life, or rebel

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.610 align:middle line:90%
against it.

01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:15.530 align:middle line:90%
So I set him free.

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow body
is the terminology

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
used by native elders that
speaks about an individual who

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:29.330 align:middle line:90%
has healed their seven chakras.

01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
When we are wounded or when we
carry trauma or toxic energies

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
in our systems, our
chakras become dulled,

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and their original colors
not available to them.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we go undergo
our healing process,

01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
each chakra is able to reflect
perfectly its natural color,

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and we end up with the
seven colors of the rainbow.

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the
Americas, there are

01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
groups of indigenous
peoples that

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
are keepers of a
body of prophecy

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that talks about the upheavals
that are happening in the Earth

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.130 align:middle line:90%
today.

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The prophecies for
the Inca are known

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:12.700 align:middle line:90%
as the prophecies of Pachacuti.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.439 align:middle line:84%
Pachacuti means the
Earth being turned over,

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.710 align:middle line:90%
being turned upside down.

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And they speak about this
time that we're living in,

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.584 align:middle line:84%
until the year 2012, as being a
time of mulching and upheaval.

01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:29.630 align:middle line:90%


01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:32.949 align:middle line:84%
They speak about the possible
extinction of humanity

01:08:32.949 --> 01:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and about the emergence of
a new human in the Earth.

01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.615 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe that
this is already taking place,

01:08:41.615 --> 01:08:44.640 align:middle line:84%
that the human
species, as we know it,

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
is becoming extinct--
has become extinct.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Because in the last 50
years, Western medicine

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
has undone the last
50,000 years of evolution

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
by saving the lives of
weak and infirm children

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that nature would not have
otherwise selected to survive.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Because in the last 50 years,
we have reduced infant mortality

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:17.380 align:middle line:90%
from nearly 35% to 5% or 6%.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We're selecting to save the
lives of children, including

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:23.609 align:middle line:84%
myself, that nature
would not have otherwise

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:25.720 align:middle line:90%
selected to survive.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're a species that has
been set adrift in creation.

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer being guided
by the hand of nature.

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%
We have begun to self-select.

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.029 align:middle line:84%
So the prophecies
speak about a new human

01:09:39.029 --> 01:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%
being born on the planet today.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
have the opportunity

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to become that new human
in our generation--

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:50.359 align:middle line:84%
to become a new species,
to become homoluminous,

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.790 align:middle line:90%
no longer homosapiens.

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:54.705 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
today the question

01:09:54.705 --> 01:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is not can we, but dare
we take that quantum

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.294 align:middle line:84%
leap into who we
are becoming today?

01:10:03.294 --> 01:12:05.611 align:middle line:90%
