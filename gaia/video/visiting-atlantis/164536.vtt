Is there any evidence that
the ancient city of Atlantis

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:90%
could have existed?

behind the mystery,

and how could we find out?

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
History, as always, is
a good place to start.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I came across writings from the
Greek philosopher Plato, who

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:90%
lived about 2,400 years ago.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
His descriptions of the
12,000 year-old Atlantis

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
were very detailed,
and gave clues

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
to everything from
the size of Atlantis

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
to its location to the culture
of the people who would have

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:90%
inhabited Atlantis at the time.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, to many, is
no more than a legend--

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:90%
a myth.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But as my research into
Plato's work grew and deepened,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis started to
become more and more real.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But how did Plato obtain
his information about the lost

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:90%
city?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> His writings reveal
that Plato received all his

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
information from one of
his ancestors called Solon,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
who lived 200
years before Plato.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Solon was a great
Greek statesman,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and he was said to have
invented democracy.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Solon had traveled to
Egypt, to the city of Sais,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
to find out more about
the ancient history

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:90%
of our civilization.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
In those days, Egypt had the
longest-documented historical

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:90%
records available.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Solon, as a statesman,
had a vested interest

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.424 align:middle line:84%
to find out about the origin of
human civilization and culture.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
There, an old Egyptian
priest told him

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
about the lost city of Atlantis
and its mighty ancient empire,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.206 align:middle line:90%
catastrophes and war.

00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
He showed him the
ancient hieroglyphs

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.875 align:middle line:84%
in the Egyptian temple which
detailed the story of Atlantis.

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
According to the
inscriptions, Egypt was once

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:84%
a colony of Atlantis, and
that's how the ancient Egyptians

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:90%
had received this information.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the temple of
Sais doesn't exist anymore.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
It was built in the Nile
Delta in a swamp area,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and has literally
sunk into the soil.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
However, via Solon and
Plato, the information

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient
temple was preserved.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Solon's detailed notes about the
existence of this great empire

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
were published six
generations later,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:90%
by his descendant Plato--

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.893 align:middle line:90%
the great philosopher.

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
This is how the great
legend survived.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So exactly what details
did Plato save for future

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:90%
generations?

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If we consider
Africa 12,000 years ago,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
with some of its land laying
150 meters below sea level,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
then the coastline may have
looked very similar to this.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Plato, these countries

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
were colonies of
Atlantis at the time.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Plato tells us that
the empire of Atlantis

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
consisted of 10
kingdoms and was made up

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
of a number of islands,
coastlines, and peninsulas

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:90%
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:84%
It was positioned
outside Gibraltar,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:90%
bordering on southern Spain--

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:90%
once called Gades.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:10%
Today's city of Cadiz reminds
us of the ancient name.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
The main island was
also called Atlantis,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and it was about 700
kilometers across.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It had mountains
around the coast

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and a great, central plain.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Its most prominent feature
was the capital city--

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:90%
the capital city of Atlantis.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Plato gave a measurement
of 127 stadia

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to the overall
width of the city.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
If we take the ancient
Greek conversion

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
of 185 meters per
stadia, it would

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
make the capital
city of Atlantis

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:84%
about 23 and 1/2
kilometers across--

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:90%
a huge city.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Its layout was highly
unusual, a city consisting

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:90%
of circles of land and water.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.664 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Here are Plato's exact words.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:10%
>> "There were alternate
zones of sea and land,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:10%
larger and smaller,
encircling one another.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:84%
There were two of land
and three of water."

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we have two land
rings and three water rings,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:90%
as Plato explained.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
The center of the city,
unlike today's cities,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
was sparsely populated, and
was the holy and sacred center

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:90%
of the empire of Atlantis.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It housed the king, royal
family, and their palaces,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
servants, and the
magnificent Temple

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
of Poseidon, which was the
main god of the Atlanteans.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
It also included the
fabled Garden of Poseidon,

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
with exotic trees and
fruits, cold and hot springs,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.415 align:middle line:90%
fountains, and pools.

00:06:46.415 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
This area was reserved for the
royal elite and high priests

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It was protected by mighty
walls and a ring of water.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
The first land ring
can be described

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
as the religious
sector of the city.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It was said to have been home
to a large priesthood who

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
performed numerous rituals and
sacrifices at various shrines.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.405 align:middle line:84%
It had towers, gates,
and hanging gardens.

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis had a powerful navy.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And the second water
ring, according to Plato,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
was the military harbor that
docked at least 1,200 warships.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The second land ring
housed the military,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and would have had living
quarters for up to 240,000

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
sailors to man the ships.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
This ring also housed the
naval stores and supplies.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:84%
It had underground docks,
soldiers training facilities,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:90%
towers, and guard houses.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
It had a road, or a racetrack,
in the middle of it,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
which was 200 meters
wide and ran right

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
around the second land ring.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:84%
This land ring was the
military center of the empire.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The third water ring was the
harbor for merchant ships,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.355 align:middle line:84%
and also functioned as a
public transport system,

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
with small boats
ferrying people from one

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:90%
part of the city to the other.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Plato then describes
the outer wall,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.395 align:middle line:84%
which encircles what one would
today call downtown Atlantis.

00:08:26.395 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> "The area between the outer
wall and the merchant harbor

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:84%
was densely crowded and
busy all day and all night."

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>> This indicates
an enormous area.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And if it was densely
populated, then it

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the
city of Atlantis

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:90%
had a truly immense population.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:84%
The city may have been home
to over a million people.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
It was considered a
city of the gods--

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
a utopia-- rich in architecture,
bustling with trade,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and protected by a great army.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, in a single day of
violent upheaval about 12,000

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.383 align:middle line:84%

completely destroyed.

We can see here how
comprehensively Plato had

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
described the city's
shape, design, and even

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:84%

and would not have
risked jeopardizing

his status by inventing a myth.

Anyone during their time
could have gone to Egypt

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:90%
to verify what he had said.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Plato insisted that what
he was saying was true.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
In his day, honor and
truth were held higher

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:90%
than the value of life.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
it should be easy
enough to find--

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:84%
unless it had sunken beneath
the ocean, as legend suggests.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%

a little deeper--

Because of its contours, it
was dubbed the eye of Africa.

Some scientists thought it
was a massive impact crater,

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
but the lack of shock-altered

formed by volcanic activity,

like a volcano before eruption

it was formed is a riddle.

But for George and
I, the fascination

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
lies in how closely the Richat
resembles the circular layout

as Plato had described,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.200 align:middle line:84%

the eye of Africa.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:90%
The match is very close.

Approximately 3/4 of the country
is desert or semi-desert,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%

of severe drought,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:90%

What do we know about the
culture of the Atlanteans?

>> Well, thanks to
Plato, quite a bit.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.800 align:middle line:84%
We know from him that their
main god was Poseidon,

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:84%
the God of the sea
the God of the waters,

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.359 align:middle line:84%
usually portrayed as
half-human and half-fish.

>> [NON-ENGLISH CHANTING]

>> What deities does the local
population of today's West

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Africa worship?

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Over the past 1,000
years, the majority

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:11.800 align:middle line:84%
of the local population
has converted to Islam.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, the Dogon
people in particular

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:84%
still maintain some of their
ancient tribal beliefs.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Let us take a closer look.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon believe in
spirits called nommo,

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.531 align:middle line:84%
usually described as amphibious
beings, fish-like creatures.

00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Folk art depictions
of the nommos

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
show creatures with humanoid
torsos and fish-like tails.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:10%
The nommos are also referred
to as the masters of the water.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:84%
This seems very
close to the images

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:84%
we have of the God Poseidon,
the god of the sea--

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.340 align:middle line:84%
which, according to Plato, was
the main god of the Atlanteans.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What else does Plato tell
us about the religious beliefs

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.740 align:middle line:90%
of the Atlanteans?

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> "The God Poseidon fell
in love with a mortal woman

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and begat and brought up five
pairs of male twin children."

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Five pairs of twins.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:90%
That's 10 children.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.430 align:middle line:84%
This is why Atlantis was
set up into 10 kingdoms.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Even the names of some of
the twins are still very alive

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.120 align:middle line:90%
in the region.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Atlas was the name of the first
born of the first set of twins.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.710 align:middle line:84%
His name is still
present in the words,

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:39.100 align:middle line:84%
"Atlantic Ocean," the "Atlas
mountains," and "Atlantis."

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.670 align:middle line:10%
The kingdom bordering
southern Spain

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.700 align:middle line:10%
was named after his
twin brother, Gadeiros.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:10%


00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:10%
The old name for Southern
Spain, Gades, as well as

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.520 align:middle line:10%
the city of Cadiz, are
a reminder of this twin.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:08.240 align:middle line:10%
And the Dogon tell us that
nommo, the master of the water,

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:10%
underwent a transformation
and multiplied

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:10%
into four pairs of twins.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Both cultures seem quite
preoccupied with twins.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The twin cult is still
very strong in West Africa.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.780 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, one
particular population group

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.060 align:middle line:84%
in West Africa has
the highest birth rate

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.270 align:middle line:90%
of twins in the world.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:84%
The twin cult finds its
expressions in works of art.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Sought-after sculptures
from West Africa show twins.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.320 align:middle line:10%
But even in Western
culture, the star sign

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.130 align:middle line:10%
Gemini depicting
twins is very popular.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And also, fish-like beings are
accounted for with the star

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:84%
sign of Pisces,
which again, is shown

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.890 align:middle line:90%
in the form of a twin fish.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the Dogon's
belief in amphibious beings

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.070 align:middle line:84%
ties up with the Atlantean God
Poseidon, who is also portrayed

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.710 align:middle line:90%
as an amphibious being--

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.600 align:middle line:84%
as does the preoccupation
with twins in both cultures.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.150 align:middle line:10%
The Dogon people have
traditional astronomical

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.820 align:middle line:10%
knowledge about the star Sirius.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.920 align:middle line:84%
That would normally be
considered impossible

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:90%
without the use of telescopes.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Could that knowledge have
come from an ancient,

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.570 align:middle line:90%
highly-developed society?

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It is believed that for
eons, the Dogon have known that

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.110 align:middle line:10%
Sirius is a binary star system
where two suns are orbiting

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:10%
around each other--

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:10%
Sirius A and Sirius B.
Obviously, with the naked eye,

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
this is impossible to notice.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon further knew that it
takes 50 years for one orbit

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:40.870 align:middle line:90%
to complete.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:43.810 align:middle line:84%
You would need fine astronomical
equipment to pick this up,

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:84%
which the Dogon
certainly did not have.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.240 align:middle line:90%


00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, the Dogon knew
that the one star, Sirius B,

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:90%
is actually a white dwarf star.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.420 align:middle line:90%
This is a dying, collapsing sun.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Our sun will, by the way,
share the same destiny.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Via a red giant, the sun is
reduced to less than 0.01%

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of its original size while
keeping the same mass,

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.050 align:middle line:90%
thus becoming incredibly heavy.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, a teaspoon
of soil from Sirius B

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:90%
will weigh as much as 6 tons.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It has 3,000 times the
density of a diamond.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.390 align:middle line:90%
This, the Dogon also knew.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They described the dwarf star
as the smallest thing, but also

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.530 align:middle line:90%
the heaviest.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon description of this
actually brings the matter

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to the point much better than
our lengthy explanations.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:90%
There is more.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.450 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon knew that there were
other objects in the Sirius

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:47.400 align:middle line:84%
star system, much smaller
than Sirius A and B. There

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is, until now, no
conclusive scientific proof

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:90%
of its existence.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Our technical equipment
is, as of yet,

00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:00.240 align:middle line:84%
not advanced enough to
confirm or deny this.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Critics mention a cultural
contamination theory,

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.580 align:middle line:84%
putting forward the possibility
that the Dogon received

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.070 align:middle line:84%
this information via
occasional contacts

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.980 align:middle line:84%
from Europe in the
last century, or even

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.420 align:middle line:84%
through the
researchers themselves

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.710 align:middle line:90%
by incorrect questioning.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Until today, the
debate carries on.

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
other African cultures

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.630 align:middle line:84%
who have the same ancient
knowledge about the star Sirius

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that was held long before
the arrival of the white man

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.340 align:middle line:90%
and his telescopes in Africa.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.380 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Would it not appear plausible
that this ancient knowledge

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.950 align:middle line:10%
that the Dogon and other West
African cultures have may stem

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.904 align:middle line:10%
from a previously
highly-developed civilization?

00:45:42.904 --> 00:45:48.840 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The evil eye, or evil look,
is believed by many cultures

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:58.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to cause bad
luck, disease, or even death.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It is comparable to
an ill-wishing look,

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:84%
the look of an
envious person who

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:84%
is not happy to see
you prosper, but will

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.980 align:middle line:90%
be pleased to see you fail.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> To counter this evil look,
a protective good luck charm

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:15.060 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of an eye is used.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Classical Greece probably had
knowledge of the evil eye from

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.970 align:middle line:84%
the Phoenicians
in ancient Egypt.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And ancient Egypt, again,
had far-older sources, which

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.020 align:middle line:90%
could have come from Atlantis.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:90%


00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting to note that
the good luck charm looks very

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.220 align:middle line:84%
similar to the shape
of the city of Atlantis

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.990 align:middle line:90%
when seen from space.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:84%
The belief in the evil eye is
the strongest in West Africa

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and in the Mediterranean
region, exactly the area which

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.530 align:middle line:90%
we had mapped out earlier.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But the belief has
spread to other regions

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.910 align:middle line:84%
as well, like America, Europe,
the Middle East, India,

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.330 align:middle line:90%
and Tibet.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.920 align:middle line:90%
If an eye with blue rings--

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.050 align:middle line:84%
very closely resembling
the water rings

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:90%
of the fabled city--

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.850 align:middle line:84%
is used as a good luck
talisman to ward off evil,

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.250 align:middle line:84%
then could Atlantis have
had the same symbolism

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:10.220 align:middle line:84%
for our whole planet, keeping
evil away from our world?

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.360 align:middle line:10%
Let us recall--

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis would have been
clearly recognizable from space

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.160 align:middle line:10%
as a structure closely
resembling an eye.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.775 align:middle line:84%
Because of space
travel, the Richat

00:47:20.775 --> 00:47:23.240 align:middle line:84%
is today known as
the eye of Africa.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:90%


00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Plato described a violent
and overwhelming cataclysm

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:84%
which resulted in the
disappearance of Atlantis.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Some speculate that
it was the Great

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Flood or the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was,
it must have been

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.160 align:middle line:84%
spectacularly
devastating to have

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.540 align:middle line:90%
annihilated a kingdom entirely.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:59.200 align:middle line:84%
All structures were
destroyed and buried.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Let us consider the
following scenario.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.570 align:middle line:84%
What would happen to
today's civilization

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:07.080 align:middle line:84%
if it were hit by
a major disaster

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and reduced to only
a few survivors?

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.890 align:middle line:84%
What effect would this
have on the surviving

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:16.400 align:middle line:90%
people and human history?

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.560 align:middle line:84%
In an instant, all
electrical equipment

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.254 align:middle line:90%
would be rendered useless.

00:48:21.254 --> 00:48:22.670 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
more electricity

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:29.290 align:middle line:84%
supply, which would mean no more
lights, no TV, no computers.

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:84%
All infrastructure
would be gone.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:84%
No more fresh food supplies
from supermarkets, restaurants,

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.450 align:middle line:90%
or shops.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Telephones-- mobile
or otherwise--

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.308 align:middle line:90%
would not function anymore.

00:48:40.308 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Access to fresh
water would be lost.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Within a few hours,
the survivors

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.380 align:middle line:84%
would be forced to fight
for their bare life,

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.260 align:middle line:90%
trying to find food and shelter.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Within only a few
generations, most buildings

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.240 align:middle line:84%
would have crumbled
and turned into ruins.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Even concrete structures
would have disintegrated.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:05.050 align:middle line:84%
After a few hundred years,
all knowledge our civilization

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.390 align:middle line:90%
had will be lost.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:10%
Science, mathematics, chemistry,
physics, biology, geography--

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.440 align:middle line:10%
all those subjects
would no longer

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.050 align:middle line:10%
be relevant or required
by the survivors,

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.910 align:middle line:10%
and be lost within
a few generations.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Books would have fallen apart,
deteriorated and crumbled,

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:29.210 align:middle line:84%
with no one able to read them
or copy them for preservation.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Information stored on computers
would be utterly obsolete.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Stories of an
advanced human society

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:84%
who was able to
travel into space

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.640 align:middle line:90%
would slowly grow fainter.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.560 align:middle line:84%
After a few thousand
years, nothing

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.640 align:middle line:84%
would be left of our
today's buildings,

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.360 align:middle line:90%
having been turned into forests.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Motorcars would have
long rusted away.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.580 align:middle line:10%
As time passes, the memories
of our technologically advanced

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:10%
civilization would
fade more rapidly,

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:01.820 align:middle line:10%
and only be preserved in some
stories and legends, which

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:10%
would increasingly be considered
as the imagination of people

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:10%
who are unhappy with
their present way of life

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.060 align:middle line:10%
and who would wish for
some fairytale to be true.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Stories of our civilization
would have turned into legends.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyone believing in
it would be ridiculed.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.480 align:middle line:84%
After a few hundred years-- or
maybe a few thousand years--

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.480 align:middle line:84%
new historical events would
form the official history

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.760 align:middle line:84%
of those surviving
humans, and this

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.400 align:middle line:84%
would be declared the
real history, the proven

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.260 align:middle line:90%
history of this age.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Maybe some giant power
station would still

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.910 align:middle line:10%
remain in a desolate
condition, hardly

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:38.220 align:middle line:10%
recognizable from its
original shape or purpose.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And our descendants might use
it as a ceremonial or funeral

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.120 align:middle line:84%
place, or consider
it as a remainder

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:84%
of a great temple, where
gods which are long gone

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.220 align:middle line:90%
were worshipped.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps some massive
foundations would

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:84%
survive as a
remarkable structure

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.520 align:middle line:90%
whose origin would be puzzling.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Our history-- the history
of our civilization--

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:02.390 align:middle line:84%
would have become
legend, a myth.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.940 align:middle line:84%
After several thousand
years, the human population

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.090 align:middle line:84%
would start to grow again, come
up with glimpses of progress,

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.240 align:middle line:84%
start small cities with
basic written languages,

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.190 align:middle line:90%
laws and trade.

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:17.240 align:middle line:84%
This would be the beginning
of a new era, a new age.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Could there have been
civilizations before us?

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Could Atlantis have
been a reality?

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.340 align:middle line:84%
We have established
how unkindly time deals

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:29.360 align:middle line:84%
with our human accomplishments,
like structures and buildings.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.300 align:middle line:84%
We can be sure that
after 12,000 years,

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:37.260 align:middle line:84%
hardly any remnants of our
civilization would be found.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.691 align:middle line:84%
But we do have the tales,
the legends, the myth.

00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.280 align:middle line:84%
In Greek mythology,
there is a tale

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:90%
about the five ages of man.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It was written down
from oral history

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:57.340 align:middle line:84%
by the Greek poet Hesiod
about 3,000 years ago.

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.800 align:middle line:10%
The first one is a golden age,
where man lived among the gods

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.732 align:middle line:10%
and freely mingled with them.

00:52:02.732 --> 00:52:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Man lived to a very old age,
but with youthful appearance,

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.610 align:middle line:90%
and did not have to work.

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:14.820 align:middle line:84%
After their time on
Earth came to an end,

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.830 align:middle line:84%
they became the
guardians of mortal men.

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:23.810 align:middle line:90%


00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.060 align:middle line:10%
In the second age,
the silver age,

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.750 align:middle line:10%
men started to refuse
to worship the gods.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.731 align:middle line:84%
And they were destroyed by Zeus,
God of thunder and lightning.

00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER CRASHES]

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.989 align:middle line:84%
They became the demons
of the underworld.

00:52:36.989 --> 00:52:39.923 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER CRASH]

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.070 align:middle line:10%
The third age was a bronze age.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:47.250 align:middle line:10%
It was a cruel and hard age.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Man was only interested in
wars and to fight each other.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:54.680 align:middle line:90%


00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.430 align:middle line:84%
They would not touch fruits,
but only eat animal meat.

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:00.200 align:middle line:84%
They were stubborn,
and were wiped out

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.714 align:middle line:90%
by their own violent ways.

00:53:01.714 --> 00:53:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:10%
The fourth age, again,
was noble and righteous.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:16.220 align:middle line:84%
It was the age of the heroes, or
demigods, that fought at Troy.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But at last, they were also
destroyed by their own wars.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:21.980 align:middle line:84%
However, when they
died, they would

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.920 align:middle line:84%
be allowed to go to the
Elysium, or paradise--

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:84%
also called the
Isles of the Blessed,

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.210 align:middle line:84%
today known as the
Canary Islands.

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:36.420 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.080 align:middle line:84%
According to Hesiod, the last
age would be our present age.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.880 align:middle line:90%
He called it the iron age.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is a
rather unpleasant age.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.690 align:middle line:84%
He speaks of children
dishonoring their parents,

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and a time where brother
fights against brother.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Not the honorable and just
person will be accepted,

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.640 align:middle line:84%
but the liar and the
criminal will be supported.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.815 align:middle line:90%
Law and decency disappears.

00:53:59.815 --> 00:54:04.470 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So here we do have an ancient
account of ages and eons

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.020 align:middle line:90%
that have existed before us.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there are others.

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:13.800 align:middle line:10%
The Mayans, for example,
have similar beliefs.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:18.700 align:middle line:84%
In combination with
our analysis of what

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.050 align:middle line:84%
would happen if a disaster
would strike our globe with only

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.720 align:middle line:84%
a few survivors left,
we could imagine

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.160 align:middle line:84%
that some structures
on our globe

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.830 align:middle line:84%
may well be the remnants
of a previous age.

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.870 align:middle line:90%


00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Could the Richat be one of them?

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Like the numerous artifacts
uncovered in the Richat area,

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.540 align:middle line:84%
it could be that the
secrets of Atlantis

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.120 align:middle line:84%
merely lie beneath the
sands of the Sahara,

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.707 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be discovered.

00:54:46.707 --> 00:54:54.340 align:middle line:90%


00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.950 align:middle line:84%
If the Richat is, indeed,
the site of Atlantis,

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:58.750 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean
to our understanding

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.302 align:middle line:90%
of ancient civilization?

00:55:00.302 --> 00:55:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.400 align:middle line:84%
We are used to being taught
a linear view of history--

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that man emerged from
his primal state,

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.440 align:middle line:84%
slowly gained intelligence
and tribal behavior,

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.590 align:middle line:84%
stumbled through the stone age,
and survived with simple tools

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:18.460 align:middle line:84%
for hunting and building, and
that the first cities were

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:23.750 align:middle line:90%
formed about 5,000 years ago.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Is conventional history
really our true past?

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> "Man is a being in
search of meaning."

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The pursuit for the purpose
of life is a search for truth.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, great
discoveries are made,

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and the search itself
gives meaning to life.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps civilizations before
us reached heights of intellect

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.456 align:middle line:84%
and organization that
we cannot even imagine.

00:55:52.456 --> 00:55:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they were not
the fools and simpletons

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.790 align:middle line:90%
that we think they were.

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.640 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is to
look a little deeper.

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.690 align:middle line:90%
