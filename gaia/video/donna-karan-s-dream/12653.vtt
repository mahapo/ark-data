Everything I instinctively felt

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.095 align:middle line:90%
it's not either or, it's and.

MICHAEL J. FOX
(VOICEOVER): We're

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:84%
trained to think that
everything stops then,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.417 align:middle line:84%
but life doesn't stop
then, life keeps going.

DR. JAMES GORDON

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:10%
is somebody who's got an open
mind to all possibilities.

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
DONNA KARAN: These
ancient traditions

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
are healing traditions.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And we are not in
respect of that.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're
not only machines.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Artistry, you know,
the hand, the touch,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
the feel, healing, you
know, it's touching somebody

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:90%
is very old.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to touch
people, people need

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
to be cared for as a
whole, we're one person.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what people
want, connection.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:90%
And I think we've lost it.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So when you inclusively
put everybody together,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
we are going to
make a difference.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, all we care
about is each other.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:90%
It's human-- human dignity.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I really have faith.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
When you see a problem
there is a solution.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
there are problems.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:90%
It's-- it's sort of simple.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.781 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:49.480 align:middle line:10%
DR. MARK HYMAN: I think
there's this true here that

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:10%
has to be spoken,
which is that we learn

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:10%
how to detach as physicians.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:10%
We're trained to disconnect,
and the secret of healing

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:10%
is falling in love
with the patient.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.961 align:middle line:84%
It's allowing yourself to enter
into that sacred relationship.

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the healing begins,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I see this
day after day in my office.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
I call myself a resort doctor,
the doctor of last resort.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.920 align:middle line:10%
People come to me after they've
seen 80 physicians sometimes,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:10%
and all they want is for
somebody to listen to them,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:10%
to validate them,
to hear their story,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:10%
and we're stories, not symptoms.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And those stories
need to be heard,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
they need to be validated,
they need to be understood,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and that begins the
healing process,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that begins the engagement
in that healing relationship.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what is
missing on a large scale

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
in our health care system.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:10%
DR. JAMES GORDON: There's
a fundamental problem

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:10%
in the education of
physicians, an imbalance,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:10%
which is really unbalanced.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:10%
That is, all the education
is basically mastering data

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:10%
and in all traditional
systems of healing,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:10%
if you were going to
become the official healer

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:10%
of your community, you had
to balance the accumulation

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:10%
of knowledge with some process
that brought about wisdom

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.547 align:middle line:10%
and modesty and understanding.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:10%
DR. WOODSON MERRELL:
Part of the problem

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:10%
with physician
practice, though, is

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:10%
they're not mentored to
value fundamental lifestyle,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:10%
which is the core of health.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
If unless you're taught to
value it within yourself

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.444 align:middle line:84%
and to value it as
relevant to patients,

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to practice it.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So when doctors get
out into practice

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.277 align:middle line:84%
they're actually not--
not pursuing this.

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And they don't think it's
important for the patient.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the training
and what's done in mentoring

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and medical schools
needs to change.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.067 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that most of
them haven't been trained

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and don't have the
tools, and we need

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
to help them to-- to get
back what most all-- most

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
every physician went
into medicine really

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
not for the money, they went
into it really out of altruism,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
like nurses do.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.375 align:middle line:84%
And along the way
it gets corrupted.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
Christie don't stop.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:90%
We need what you do.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:10%
She said 15 years ago
I had breast cancer,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:10%
and I was getting ready to
be rolled in on the gurney

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:10%
into the OR, and my
doctor took me by the hand

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:10%
and he held my
hand to his heart,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:10%
and he looked me square in
the eye, two inches away

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:10%
from my eyes, and he
said, Ann I want you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:10%
to know I'm here only for you.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:90%
We're doing this together.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:84%
In five seconds, he
established community with her,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
he eased her mind, he empowered
her, he elevated her spirit,

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
he did integrative
medicine in five seconds.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:10%
My passion is the heart.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:10%
And I spent most
of my time working

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:10%
on people's hearts
literally, but not as much

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:10%
as I desire to figuratively.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And the heart, which is our
most poetic of all organs,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, we have bleeding
hearts and cold hearts

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and stone hearts, but it is the
aspect of the patient I think

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:90%
we deal with least effectively.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm coming to
the realization

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that what we have
to do is create

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:90%
a smart patient movement.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the way
to reform medicine

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:84%
is to have a group
of smart patients,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.014 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's 10% of the
population, their caregivers,

00:04:50.014 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmingly,
which means they're

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
women that take care of
their sons, their husbands,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:90%
their fathers.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are
going to drive this change.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And for it to
happen effectively,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:90%
we have to empower them.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
We need to give them
the tool kits they need,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and then we have to make
medicine responsive to it.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that we can
actually make that happen.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I would plead with all
involved in this process

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that we look for logistically
achievable solutions.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But by taking them
into Beth Israel

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:84%
or any other major medical
center and getting them to work

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.390 align:middle line:84%
is difficult because we
often don't translate

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.485 align:middle line:90%
the information effectively.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:10%
The training of
doctors, I think,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:10%
is critical in the system.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:10%
But I also think it's
critical to empower patients

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:10%
to remember they have choice.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways you
change a system is remember,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
a system is made up of people
and it's made up of choices,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and the moment you focus
on you're out of control,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
you feel it, you know, the
moment you focus on fear

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is not an option, your--
your body and your emotion

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning changes,
and your actions

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:90%
are going to change.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:84%
When someone has
a belief, a belief

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
is a feeling of certainty about
what something means to you.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
certain, you are unified.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
very often is people

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
walk in with a certain amount
of certainly they've developed

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor doesn't
realize he takes it away.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And very often, that's designed
to lower the expectations

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
so people don't
suffer more or hurt,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:84%
but there's no greater
suffering than no hope.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I just want to touch
on this idea of healing.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And-- and you guys are talking
from a doctor's point of view,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:84%
but also from the
patient's point of view.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of-- of a
thing I say to my children

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and now-- now
it's become rote with my kids.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:10%
I'll say, a lady had
a baby in a tree,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:10%
and when I say a lady had a baby
tree that means don't tell me

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.217 align:middle line:10%
your problem, show me that--
that you're willing to do what

00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:10%
it takes to solve that problem.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.883 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on the fact
they had this flooding

00:06:45.883 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
in Mozambique, and this woman
who was pregnant climbed a tree

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and spent four days in
the top of the tree,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and then had her baby
on the top of the tree.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
That to me, is a symbol
of-- as a patient,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:84%
you have an obligation
to climb that tree.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And-- and to not just
wait at the bottom

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and wait for the apple to fall
down, hit you on the head,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and you eat it and be healthy.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:10%
The most important
thing in all of this

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:10%
really isn't doctors,
nurses, kinds of doctors,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.045 align:middle line:10%
it's really yourself.

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere within this
combination of people and need

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
for people's support
is after you've

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
had a traumatic experience,
you find within yourself

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to integrate with other
things and to have more

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:90%
vision and power and strength.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:90%
You find that within yourself.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:53.955 align:middle line:84%
And then you can put yourself
out there and use knowing all

00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:90%
of these different components.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Which ones are the ones for you?

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.345 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
responsibility of yourself,

00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:10.565 align:middle line:84%
to take power over the
doctors, the nurses,

00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and find that it's all
within your choice.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:10%
Now I spent the next few weeks
in traction in the children's

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:10%
ward in the hospital,
and for quite awhile

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't move or talk and
I was just sort of floating.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Then one day one of the
doctors came to see me,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and he told me that I wouldn't
be able to walk again.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
this guy is crazy.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is he even a doctor?

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Although I couldn't say
that or anything else

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
since I couldn't
talk, but I was sure

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
he had no idea
what he was saying.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
was going to walk,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and I just had to
concentrate, just keep

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
contact with my feet,

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
just convince them,
will them to move.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:10%
One of the ways I embrace the
chaos of my particular illness

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:10%
was really to define a style
for how I was going to be sick.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
my illness the way

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I was going to run my
business, and I created a team.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And that took a lot
of effort on my part

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to get my neurologist,
my oncologist,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and I found a psychologist
who studies the psychology

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:90%
of illness in women.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And I anointed her
the team captain.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So there really
had a point where

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:84%
when I was on
particular medicines,

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.285 align:middle line:84%
I had the entire group
figure out how the medicines

00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:90%
were going to interact.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And I found that to be
really a great way to do it.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
metaphors are, you're

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
going to fight your illness,
but I'm a lover not a fighter.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to image oh,
a big battle in my head.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just wanted,
you know, my unhappy cells

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.501 align:middle line:84%
to take the happy cells out
for a pint and talk it over,

00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want all these
warlike metaphors.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And I communicated
that to my doctors

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and I've been so blessed
for this journey.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:10%
KRIS CARR: Doctors can
often make you feel silly

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:10%
or like a Google civilian when
you come in with these ideas

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.340 align:middle line:10%
that I might want to try this
or what if this would help,

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:10%
what do you think,
and I know first hand

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:10%
that finding that right
oncologist who will actually

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:10%
listen to you and take
into account your needs

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:10%
and your desires and
your spiritual beliefs

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:10%
and your just overall
attitude and thirst

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:10%
is the most important
thing that you can do.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you're going
to walk completely away

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
from Western medicine, you
have to find somebody who

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:84%
can be a part of your
team and also say

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
there are other team members
that we're going to work with.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The moment I found
out that I had cancer I

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
really went to a place of calm.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:10%
I think I became very
at peace with my illness

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:10%
because I never
focused on the cancer,

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:10%
what I focused on was why is--
like why is this happening?

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:90%
What's my contribution?

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I was very, very aware
of the spiritual side,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:90%
and very aware of my power.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:10%
It's that the total disbelief
that someone has just

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:10%
said those words to you,
that you have cancer.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:10%
It's got to change something
in one's cells, you know.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
It is such a profound
thing to be told.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The idea that a doctor can say
certain words to me that can so

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
profoundly shock me
was sort of a set

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
up for what I was about to
go through because, you know,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.065 align:middle line:84%
the doctor becomes God because
they have all the information,

00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I have none of it.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm in grave danger and they
can fix it, theoretically.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think everybody
in a hospital situation

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.003 align:middle line:10%
or in a situation of
illness, even if they're not

00:11:31.003 --> 00:11:33.721 align:middle line:10%
in a hospital need someone to
help them navigate the system.

00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:90%
.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I work in a hospital, so you
kind of are less intimidated

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%
if you work in that environment,
but for someone who doesn't,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:90%
it's very intimidating.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Or how do you sort through all
of these different resources?

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Who do I talk to?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
You can hear many
different people

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:90%
and many different inputs.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think having a
navigator or a guide,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
whatever one wants to call it,
to help people through just

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
sorting out the information,
sorting out the system,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
sorting out the red
tape, sorting out how

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:84%
do I put a team together,
because hospitals

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:90%
aren't all there yet.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the patients who are
doing the integrating.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I might see my Western
doctor and my acupuncturist

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and my herbalist, and who's
putting that together?

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Who's having them
talk to each other

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
so that the doctor knows that
the herbalist isn't poisoning

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:84%
me and the herbalist
can say well,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
the doctor, maybe you could
do some blood tests to see

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:90%
if my herbs are doing any good.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.985 align:middle line:90%
We need that dialogue.

00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a post-colonial
mentality in our-- or sometimes

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:10%
I say not quite post-colonial--
still a little bit

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:10%
colonial in attitude.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And we think we are the high
civilization of the universe.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:84%
We have machinery so that
proves that we are more--

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and we can destroy more
than anybody ever could,

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
so that proves that we are
superior, which is incorrect.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And we do not
necessarily understand

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:90%
the environment well.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
We are wrecking the
planet, we do not

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:84%
understand the human
body and mind and spirit

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that well, because we are we
have very powerful things that

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
have powerful effects,
but often side effects,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and we have like
50% hospital beds

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
are caused by misdiagnosis and
misimplification of medicine.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And-- and our health system
is in a bit of shambles

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.910 align:middle line:84%
at this point, although
there are wonderful things

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:90%
that they do do.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's not that to
throw the whole baby out

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
with the bath water,
but there's really

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:90%
a revolution that is required.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And to form the key
revolution, in my view,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
is an attitudinal one
where the arrogance

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Western mechanistic
industrial sort of intellect

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
supported in the medical schools
and universities and things

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that we know best
and everybody else

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
is a native, an unwashed
native, and so on.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This attitude has
to change, and we

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
have to realize that we need
help to reconnect to nature

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:84%
in a different way,
reconnect to our patients,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
reconnect to ourselves
in a different way.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, then the
tools that we have invented

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
could be used
really brilliantly,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and so but that's
the revolution,

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:84%
the creating of a-- of a
world medicine, if you will.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:10%
DR. BHASWATI BHATTACHARYA: So
some years ago I found myself

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:10%
in Tibet, living
there for many months

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:10%
and working with a Tibetan
doctor called [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.560 align:middle line:10%
And I started presuming that
the reason that they were using

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:10%
these little round pills
and not the fresh white ones

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:10%
was because they
didn't have access,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:10%
and they didn't
have money to get

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:10%
the real medicine, the good
medicine that we in the West

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:10%
had.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked
[INAUDIBLE], why is it

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that they don't use the
medicines from America,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
the Western medicines?

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, we
have to be patient.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Look at modern medicine.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:90%
How old is it?

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:90%
80 years?

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:90%
60 years?

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a young medicine.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Our medicine, Tibetan medicine,
which is Chinese medicine,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine,
and unani, which

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
is Greek Persian
medicine combined,

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:84%
we are thousands of years
doing what we're doing.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
We have so much
experience, we have

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:90%
to be patient with the child.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Modern medicine believes that
they are right, as children do.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Modern medicine believes
that they have all

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:90%
the answers, as children do.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be
patient with them.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:10%
A healer is there for
the process of healing,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:10%
and is not wedded to his or
her particular methodology.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So a healer is open to
using whatever works.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The true healer
is somebody who's

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:84%
got an open mind to
all possibilities,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:84%
because he or she is there,
whether as a researcher

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:84%
or a clinician in the
service of the people

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
he or she is working with,
not in the surface of the ego,

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.645 align:middle line:84%
not in the service of
greed, not in the service

00:15:53.645 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:90%
of received ideas.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:10%
If you can reach a level
of trust in whatever path

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:10%
you've taken, that is going
to lead you to a light,

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:10%
to openness, to expansion,
to breaking down

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:10%
of all boundaries, to more
love, more compassion, more

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:10%
possibilities, that will
activate with trust,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:19.195 align:middle line:10%
with not just belief, but really
a giving trust and a confidence

00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:10%
that comes along with
that, that you're really

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:10%
on to something that works.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.655 align:middle line:10%
You're back home in the
field of all possibilities

00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:10%
where everything is
connected to everything else,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:10%
where you're totally
comfortable with uncertainty,

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.235 align:middle line:10%
because you want to live in the
unknown, the known is the past,

00:16:35.235 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:10%
it's dead, it's gone.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
The unknown is
where the action is.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So you want to live in
the unknown, where there's

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
spontaneity, where
there's creativity,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and where you realize that
you can go create with God.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So try it every
day, 10-15 minutes,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself who am
I, what do I want,

00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
go into the discontinuity,
get in touch with the soul,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:90%
and be totally spontaneous.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:84%
Because in spontaneity is
the movement of the unknown.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:29.934 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.934 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:10%
RICHARD FREEMAN: I
think this is probably

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:10%
the point of a challenge
for all of us is to find

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:10%
in our relationships
with our own body

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:10%
and with our fellow humans,
those points where it appear

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:10%
to be great obstacles,
which appear to be as

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:10%
frightening as death itself,
and how to actually just

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:10%
be there in that calm space.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And in that calm space, the
connection or the resolution

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:90%
is already there.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
What the physician is
really giving the patient

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of self
knowledge, so they're

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:90%
turning into their own doctor.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And so if we turn the
whole argument over,

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
it's how can we
educate patients?

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look around at
all the people who are healing

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
or have been healed, they
know a tremendous amount

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
about themselves and
about the specific disease

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that they've are dealing
with or have overcome.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Before I compared this to
the idea of the guru, which

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps an archaic model
in which there's an authority

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and then there are
simply the patients

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
are like little children
taking every-- taking the word

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:90%
of the authority literally.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think a new model
is being born where--

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and this I think the West
has to give to the east,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:84%
is that it's no longer
the age of the guru,

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
it's the age of
this interaction,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:84%
which turns out to
be an equal-- equal

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:90%
partnership on both sides.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a real
place for integration

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:10%
between Western
medicine and yoga.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine
has given us so much

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our ability
to combat disease

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to take
care of traumatic injury

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
things, but it certainly

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have all the answers.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It has not been addressed
preventative situations

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.750 align:middle line:84%
or long term chronic
conditions really effectively.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
It has provided drugs
that sometimes absolutely

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
are the best answer, but
it hasn't provided all

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:90%
the answers that one can have.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:10%
I think Western
medicine's changing.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:10%
And I think Western
medicine needs to change.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:10%
And I think the way it's opening
up to alternative therapy,

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:10%
and which includes yoga, is
a fairly slow process because

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:10%
of the financial and
political interest

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:10%
that there are in
maintaining the status quo.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
The thing that we
all want to avoid

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of
skism that's coming

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and a debate and
conflict that's happening

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
between the alternative and
conventional medicine, which

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
is funded by the
pharmaceutical companies.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
within the media,

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and certainly within
the alternative media

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
at the moment, this kind
of conflict coming up.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:10%
We have an issue that
the media in this country

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:10%
is not communicating, so that--
so that you're not even aware

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:10%
of the problem as a citizen.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And not being aware
of the problem,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:84%
you can't-- it's harder for
you to make a difference,

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's another
reason that the Urban

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Zen initiative is so exciting.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Because then there will be
much more of an opportunity

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
for the average person to
hear the problem and say,

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to see if I
can make a difference.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:10%
There's a couple
things that are

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:10%
so important in the
hospital situation

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:10%
that yoga can begin to help.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
One is just contact, we need
to get the people in contact

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:90%
with their body.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people in
the hospital are thinking,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:84%
oh I need to, you know,
get away from my body.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I need to get rid of the pain.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I need to get rid of
everything about what

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:90%
my body's telling me right now.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:84%
What yoga's going
to do, it's going

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to have us meditate in
the body, it's going

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:90%
to have an in body experience.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And we actually know
without a question

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that yoga can help
in the hospitals.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it time
and time again.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Just by teaching patients
simple breathing techniques,

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:84%
simple relaxation
techniques, we can

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:84%
allow their mental state
to be less agitated, less

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:90%
anxious, less confused, right?

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And physically we can relieve
them of a lot of symptoms.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
These are the important
things: meditation, relaxation

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and restorative yoga postures.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It also empowers the patient
to take some responsibility

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.267 align:middle line:84%
for their own healing process,
which is incredibly liberating,

00:22:12.267 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:84%
if you're not
waiting for a doctor

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:84%
to come in and give you a pill
or tell you what's going on.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when, of course, people
are in an acute situation,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:84%
it becomes even more important
to teach a person how to focus,

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to release, to relax, to
actually let the body do it's

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:90%
innate job of healing itself.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:10%
These shifts can happen.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:10%
I think it's the 11th hour,
but it's not 11:50 yet.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
the deeper you go,

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
you know, time itself-- Einstein
said that time is an illusion

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, as is space.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The shallower you're thinking,
the more quickly time moves.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The deeper you're
thinking, the more

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
you can expand time and through
prayer, through meditation,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:84%
through spiritual
practice, through deeper

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
reflection and mindfulness,
deeper conversation.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
buzz of this moment,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
all moving into.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we deepen
this way, then we

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:90%
can go very high and in time.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But we must make
of ourselves right

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:90%
now precision instruments.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:84%
We can do this, but I think
we need to really support

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.132 align:middle line:90%
each other in doing it now.

00:23:18.132 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:10%
You know, I can't say that
anything has gone wrong

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:10%
with humanity or civilization.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:10%
I think everything's going
just the way it was planned,

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:10%
it's just we don't
know the plan.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how it's
going to turn out.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that from my own
part, what I try to do

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
is spend the predominant
amount of time

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in my life being
kind to others rather

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:90%
than taking advantage of them.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I try to spend a lot of my time
serving the needs of others

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
rather than worrying
about when I get mine.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The reason I do that
is not because I feel

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:84%
that the world is too
selfish or the world is--

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:84%
is corrupted somehow,
but I feel that you're

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
either part of the problem or
you're part of the solution.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Both have to exist, the problem
and solution simultaneously.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But some people will
carry the solution

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and some people will
carry the problem.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.635 align:middle line:90%
I choose to carry the solution.

00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:90%

it's that every one of us

touches every one of us,
be conscious, be involved,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and just show your love.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:90%

here for practically

in a weird twisted way.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:90%

for when I'm not feeling so good
because it's not so easy then.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:10%
In my practice
in Buddhism, the--

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:10%
the basic teaching is that
you come into the world,

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:10%
and guess what.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.782 align:middle line:90%
You're going out.

00:26:36.782 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:90%
You know, there's no escape.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so much a question
of trying to get someone

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
to the place of where
they're accepting death,

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:84%
but to the place of being out
of suffering around the death.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.665 align:middle line:84%
I am-- I'm just trying
to be happy every day.

00:26:59.665 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much loss,
I feel like, you know,

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I can move
on to the next thing,

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:90%
you know, and I'm curious to.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:10%
It's quite phenomenal to
see how people-- how brave

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:10%
they are, how resourceful they
are, how brave and resourceful

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:10%
we all are.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Death is the most egalitarian
thing I know about in my life.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like a party that
everyone gets invited to,

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter how cute you
are, doesn't matter, you know,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
how educated you are, or what
kind of family you come from,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:84%
or what you have to wear, we're
all invited to this party.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:90%
So we best prepare for it.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.310 align:middle line:84%
We best prepare for
it, moment by moment.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't mean that
we have to walk around being

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:90%
terrified of dying, no.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Look death straight in the face
and know it's going to happen,

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:90%
and then live your life.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:10%
When we release ourself
from the fear of death,

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:10%
because most people
don't-- they're not

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:10%
really afraid of death,
they're afraid of living,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:10%
living full out.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:10%
So once you-- you break
that fear of death and fear

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:10%
of living, you become in
tune with such a power that

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:10%
is ready to become
conscious of itself

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:10%
through you if
you let it happen.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank God, I was connected
on another level,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that being yoga and acupuncture
and Eastern medicine.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And where I found is that
the hospital it wasn't one.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It was either or, it
was-- it wasn't together.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had to navigate
the path for him.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So I always felt there
needed to be that one

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:84%
person that each
patient is assigned

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.624 align:middle line:90%
for to go through the journey.

STEVE (VIDEO
PLAYBACK): So goodbye,

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:90%
it's been lovely seeing you.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:90%
See you soon.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Hasta luego and whatever.

DONNA KARAN: So on Steven's
journey it was one thing,

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and then on Lynn's the
journey got very complicated.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:84%
First, it was breasts,
then it was brain,

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.940 align:middle line:90%
and two different specialists.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:90%
How do we hold it together?

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:90%
We're naive.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- for me, I had
to recognize my own power

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:84%
to choose, and choice is a big
thing in the entire universe

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that you get to
choose what you do.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.940 align:middle line:84%
No one chooses really for
you, you get to be happy,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:84%
you get to be sad, you
get to have be in pain

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and suffer from that,
or you were in pain

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and you just recognize you're
in pain and you live with pain.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:84%
All these are choices
that you make yourself,

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and I think the same is true
of integrating east and west.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
If that's really
what you need, it

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:22.070 align:middle line:84%
should totally be available in
the hospital there to have it.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I survived and I don't really
like to call it survived,

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because you just--
especially with brain cancer,

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.000 align:middle line:84%
you really never know
if you're a survivor

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.650 align:middle line:90%
or you're not a survivor.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But today, because I look at
every day, I am a survivor.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And I sit here with
you as a miracle.

You put your hope and your--
your power into coming out

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:84%
the other side,
because when you come

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:16.339 align:middle line:84%
out the other side it's--
it's just-- you're born again.

celebrate all those people's and
lives you've already touched,

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.850 align:middle line:90%
and will continue to touch.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
--amazing to me to
touch more than myself

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.840 align:middle line:90%
is just already incredible.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing
miracle, that you've

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.927 align:middle line:90%
created for me that happened.

00:34:47.927 --> 00:34:48.915 align:middle line:90%

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, I have not
talked about this really,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and certainly not
in public at all,

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's still-- it's
been almost four years,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's still, you know,
it comes back in a second,

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to sit in a doctor's office
and have them say those words

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:90%
to you, you have cancer.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.820 align:middle line:84%
From that moment on,
nothing is the same.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I was in a-- having a mammogram
in an office in Chinatown

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and they were all Chinese,
and my doctor's half Chinese

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:84%
because they're
like half and half,

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.737 align:middle line:84%
but obviously was
quite difficult,

00:35:37.737 --> 00:35:39.070 align:middle line:84%
because there were
400 of them in there,

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.550 align:middle line:84%
they're all screaming,
and my car wasn't working,

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and nobody could
understand my accent,

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:90%
and I was that close to going.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I remember in that moment
thinking if I could do anything

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to just back time up to
before I heard those words,

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:84%
you know what I mean, maybe
I would change my mind not

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
get this biopsy, just
go back to a time

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that-- where there
was-- where I was

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:90%
just not overwhelmed with fear.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I feel blessed.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I feel blessed that my life,
I get to sit and hear and take

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:84%
in and be changed
by and be disturbed

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:84%
by and weep over and laugh
over other people's suffering.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the great gift.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the great gift.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:84%
The painful life is a
life where you're alone,

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and you don't inhale people
and you don't take in people

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and you don't see people and you
become progressively isolated

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and shut down and deadened
and deadened and deadened

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:84%
until you have no reason
to be here anymore.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
In the end when it all
happened, and I went up

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:84%
to the [INAUDIBLE]
and everything,

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.110 align:middle line:84%
there just never seem to be
somebody there to like sit down

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:43.810 align:middle line:90%
and talk.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was so like--
it was like rehearsed.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had like-- you do
this over here and you do that.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And I see the sort of the
very competent doctor come in

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and the nurses and, you
know, but they don't know--

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.110 align:middle line:84%
unless they sit themselves on
a table for their four month

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:84%
checkup after they've
had cancer and you

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.320 align:middle line:84%
don't know if they're going
to find more, until they've

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.485 align:middle line:84%
gone through it themselves, they
don't know the level of panic.

00:37:06.485 --> 00:37:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it's like trying to --

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
how do you teach somebody
bedside manner, you know.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach that?

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my doctor's
were all great,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
but they were like coal
miners, you know, they're

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.130 align:middle line:90%
like [INAUDIBLE] in here.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be like, you
know, get your tits out,

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and it'd be like,
oh I'm so Scottish

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.246 align:middle line:84%
and they'd be like well
there's people everywhere,

00:37:23.246 --> 00:37:24.080 align:middle line:90%
and I would be like.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And you mind if we
bring in some students

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and it would be like ten
students, and I'm like ah,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.940 align:middle line:90%
it's a nightmare.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It was really a nightmare.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't want you
to come in and fix them.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
want-- and I think

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.300 align:middle line:90%
this is true medically as well.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Most people want you to
hear them and care for them,

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.440 align:middle line:84%
so that they can find the where
with all in their own systems

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:84%
to become immune, to build
up their immunity, to create

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
their strengths, to
create their know how,

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to create their
vision of the world,

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and that comes from another
person witnessing you, honoring

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:84%
you, bearing witness
to your pain,

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.940 align:middle line:84%
sitting with your struggle,
that's what healing is.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm a sentient human
going through a very

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:middle line:90%
difficult experience.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just this walking
cancer person, you know.

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm a-- I'm a
ridiculously sensitive

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.510 align:middle line:90%
human who's terrified.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:17.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a definitely coldness
to the institution of medicine,

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
which I think so many
of us have experienced

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:90%
and want to have changed.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the place
itself needs to change,

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked
about this and just

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:84%
the space itself
like how it can feel

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:90%
like a more comfortable place.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.620 align:middle line:84%
You go to the hospital
and they're just

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
trying to kill you, with
not only the nutrition

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.780 align:middle line:90%
but your lack of sleep.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You get-- if you want to
be in the hospital that

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:47.500 align:middle line:84%
means that you really
want to get sicker.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Both my parents had
just had hospitalizations

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.740 align:middle line:84%
in the last year-- I had like
a grilled cheese sandwich

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and a piece of
white bread thinking

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.660 align:middle line:84%
what-- are you kidding
me, you just had a heart

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:90%
attack for Christ's sake.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:84%
You could be talking more
about nutrition and diet and all

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:84%
these things that they say,
they say well you know,

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.410 align:middle line:90%
you know, eat well.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you
don't have the time.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that my father could
have had a better experience,

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.060 align:middle line:84%
a much better
experience, and I wish

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.380 align:middle line:90%
I could have facilitated that.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I can help now
to facilitate that having gone

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:23.180 align:middle line:84%
through his experience, but also
with the people that I-- that I

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:84%
know and the-- the access that
we have as a group, that idea

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.510 align:middle line:84%
of being part of this community,
which I think this now,

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:90%
this is a movement.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm-- I'm so grateful
to be where I am and to be

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
healthy and when there
are people who you know,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.330 align:middle line:90%
haven't been as lucky.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are
ways to, you know,

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt there
ways to heal more people

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and to heal the same people
maybe more effectively.

I've talked to a
lot of people that

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.280 align:middle line:84%
are told that they
had six months

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're still
alive 20 years later.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's nothing-- there's
no-- it's all about in here,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
it's all about the
inner-- the inside of you.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
the inside of you,

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:07.250 align:middle line:84%
because I think you can
actually keep yourself alive.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.396 align:middle line:90%
I do, I think you can fight it.

DONNA KARAN: The lessons that
I've learned from my husband,

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.010 align:middle line:84%
the lessons that I hope
to give to my children

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.450 align:middle line:84%
or my grandchildren, these
are the most important

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.460 align:middle line:90%
people in the world to me.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And to think that I had an
idea, and I didn't do everything

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I could have possibly
done to make a difference,

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get up every morning.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.886 align:middle line:90%
It's just who I am.

00:40:33.886 --> 00:40:35.629 align:middle line:90%
