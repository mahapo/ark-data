00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>>Welcome, everyone.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.670 align:middle line:10%
This is "The One
Goal, Ascension."

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.950 align:middle line:10%
What would you say
is the one goal

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:10%
that every human being wants
to attain more than anything?

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.950 align:middle line:10%
If you could make a wish
and it be fulfilled,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.850 align:middle line:10%
what would you wish for?

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Would you wish for more
time, more love, more energy,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
more success, more safety,
more children, to look better,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:90%
belonging?

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Would you seek more
answers or pleasure?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:90%
What about growth?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
What would that one thing be?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:10%
And if you had all these
things, or any one of them,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:10%
what would that do for you?

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:10%
What would that
bring into your life

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:10%
that you presently don't have?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:10%
The answer is
accomplishing these goals

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:10%
or attaining these goals would
make you feel more whole,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:10%
would make you
feel more complete.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:10%
Wholeness is what we
want more than anything.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:10%
Because if we are
whole, we are fulfilled.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:10%
Spiritually speaking,
our ultimate goal

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:10%
is to be more holy,
a play on whole.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:10%
We want to be able
to receive blessings

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:10%
from the god of our
choice and to bless others

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:10%
with this divine presence.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:10%
More, we want to go to or
ascend to a better place, a more

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:10%
holy place-- by whatever name
we call that place-- when

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:10%
we leave Earth.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:10%
This is what we really want, and
wish for, more than anything.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:10%
This leads to a really
important question.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:10%
How are you going to
ascend to this place?

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:10%
I often ask people,
what's your exit strategy?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:10%
When it's time for you to leave,
where are you going to go?

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:10%
And how are you
going to get there?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:10%
In other words, why
are you still here?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:10%
What are you doing with
your time here on Earth?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:10%
And how are you going to
get where you want to go?

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:10%
These are
extraordinary questions

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:10%
that people often give
very little time, energy,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:10%
or consideration to.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:10%
But in this presentation, we're
going to provide some thoughts

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:10%
on this issue.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:10%
The reason we are here is
because we lack something

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:10%
that keeps us here on Earth.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:10%
We are not whole.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:10%
So in this presentation, I'm
going to show you what I know

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:10%
or have learned
about how to attain

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:10%
a greater sense of wholeness,
and perhaps, even holiness.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:10%
Our problem, as I
see it, is that we're

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:10%
all 2/3 divine and 1/3 human.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:10%
In other words,
we're 240 out of 360,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:10%
if 360 symbolizes
wholeness, and wholeness

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:10%
is symbolized by a circle.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:10%
So we're all 240 out of 360.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:10%
I derived this from the
second oldest human story.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:10%
It's called the
"Epic of Gilgamesh."

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:10%
It's an immortality tale.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:10%
In the story, we're
told that Gilgamesh,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:10%
who was a Sumerian
king around 2500 BC,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:10%
is visited by a goddess
who tells him that he's

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:10%
2/3 divine and 1/3 human.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:10%
And if he wants to make it
through the gate of the gods,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:10%
as he's shown here in
this cylinder seal,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:10%
that he's going to have
to clean up his act.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:10%
Because if he tries to
go through this gate

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:10%
at 2/3 divine, it's going to
be like walking into a blender.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:10%
He's going to get
his feathers ruffled.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:10%
So this goddess is encouraging
Gilgamesh to clean up his act

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:10%
to become not 240,
but to become 360,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:10%
to become whole,
holy, and complete.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
his tale is about.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:10%
In this extraordinary
seal, we see

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:10%
Gilgamesh in the gate of
the gods, which we may even

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:10%
think of as a stargate.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:10%
He has ascended a
flight of stairs.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:10%
And he stands in the
gate that is flanked

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:10%
by squiggly lines that
symbolize both water, as well

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:10%
as frequency or vibration.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:10%
So what's happened
here is that Gilgamesh

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:10%
has scaled up his
vibration, his frequency,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:10%
enabling him to match
that of the divine beings

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:10%
in the divine realm and now
is able to effortlessly go

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:10%
through that gateway.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:10%
You see the two figures on
either side of the gate?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:10%
They're called janitors.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:10%
And the pun or joke there
is that they are there

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:10%
to prepare to clean
up the mess, just

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:10%
in case anybody tries
walking through this gate

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:10%
if they're not completely
holy or a pure being.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:10%
So that's 2500 BC-- establishes
the human quest for wholeness

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:10%
and holiness.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:10%
Because archetypically
speaking, we're all Gilgamesh.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:10%
We're all 2/3 divine,
1/3 human, working

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:10%
on polishing up our pearl
or cleaning up our act,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:10%
so to speak.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:10%
2,500 years after Gilgamesh,
we learn the story of Jesus.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:10%
And in this image here, we
see the identical scenario.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:10%
A whole, holy, or
perfected human

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:10%
enters a gateway
filled with light that

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:10%
is also flanked by two beings.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:10%
In this case, angels.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:10%
But it's the same
story as Gilgamesh.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:10%
And we know that this story is
one of the most ancient human

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:10%
stories.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:10%
And it continued into
the time of Jesus

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:10%
and even continues to this day.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:10%
So whole equals holy.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:10%
But it also equals perfect
in the Christian tradition.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:10%
And this actually is our
goal, to become whole, holy,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:10%
or perfect beings.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:10%
The word perfect
means compassionate.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:10%
It means whole.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:10%
It also means that
the person has

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:10%
attained full human potential,
which ultimately is all

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:10%
our goal.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.107 align:middle line:10%
We know that Jesus is
portrayed as a perfect being.

00:06:03.107 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:10%
And we know he's
shown as perfect when

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:10%
he's enfolded within a
rainbow ring or an aura

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:10%
of rainbow-like energy.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:10%
This resurrection
image shows Jesus

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:10%
having attained the next
level of human evolution.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:10%
He has gone from man to
divine man or God man.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:10%
And he, in the esoteric sense,
according to researchers,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:10%
was here to show us the way to
attain the sense of wholeness,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:10%
holiness, and perfection.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:10%
So in my work, I've
gone about collecting

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:10%
these images of Jesus in the
rainbow ring, the resurrected

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:10%
Jesus, showing us
or modeling for us

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:10%
this attainment of human
perfection or wholeness.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:10%
And the rainbow then becomes
the symbol for human ascension

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:10%
as well as human perfection.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is its meaning
in Christian art.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:10%
Christians, of course,
believe that in the end times,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:10%
as recorded in the Book of
Revelation chapter 20, verse

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:10%
12, "the entire
human body of Christ

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:10%
will be changed to Light
to match the body of Christ

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.130 align:middle line:10%
in his exalted state
in his Kingdom."

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:10%
What that means is that, in this
flash of the blink of an eye,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:10%
we will all attain this sense
of wholeness and holiness

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:10%
and be able to do the very
same things that Jesus was

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:10%
able to do, which means to
be able to heal and to exude

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:10%
this sense of divine presence.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:10%
Some people shy away from this
kind of concept or suggestion

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:10%
that all of us have
this ability within us.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:10%
But this is the basic teaching
not only of Christianity,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:10%
but also of the ancient
Egyptian religion,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:10%
of the Tibetan tradition,
of the Essene tradition,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:10%
and the Cathar tradition, which
we will also be discussing

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:10%
in other presentations.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:10%
So what we're asked to
believe here is that all of us

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:10%
have this potential within us.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:10%
What we need to learn
to do is to take

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:10%
the steps that will enable us to
attain this sense of wholeness.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:10%
This light body, or rainbow
body as it's also called,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:10%
is what the Apostle Paul was
talking about in 1 Corinthians

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:10%
when he proclaims
that we shall all

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:10%
be changed in the twinkling
of an eye at the last trump.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:10%
In other words, we will all
become these glowing light

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:10%
beings.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:10%
It's a pretty wild concept for
most people to think about.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:10%
But the idea is
that we're sort of

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.940 align:middle line:10%
like those two caterpillars
I saw once looking up

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:10%
at the butterfly.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:10%
They looked at one
another and said,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:10%
you'll never get me up
in one of those things.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:10%
And that's our
fundamental predicament.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:10%
We look at images such as this,
of Christ in the rainbow body,

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:10%
and we say, you'll never get
me up in one of those things.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:10%
Even my church tells me I
can't accomplish these things.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:10%
And that's our
fundamental dilemma.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:10%
We have to close that
gap between 240 and 360.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And the question then
becomes, how do we do this?

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:10%
In the Tibetan
tradition, they speak

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:10%
of what's called Dzogchen,
or the Great Perfection,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:10%
also known as the
mystic rapture.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:10%
And in this tradition,
a teacher or yogi

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:10%
who has acquired the highest
forms of accomplishment

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:10%
can transform the subtle
aspects of the human body

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:10%
into pure light or what is
called "the rainbow body"

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:10%
or "body of light."

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:10%
And in Tibetan art,
we see this next level

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:10%
of human attainment
or manifestation

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:10%
as a swirling mass of energy.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:10%
What has happened here is
that the Lama has accelerated

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:10%
the frequency of his
body until it dissolves

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:10%
into multi-colored
rainbow light,

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:10%
leaving behind only hair, toe,
and fingernails which have

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:10%
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:10%
Think about that.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:10%
Think about what our human body
was designed to be able to do.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:10%
We all indeed are in a
caterpillar-like form here,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:10%
a pupal phase.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:10%
The rainbow body equals the
butterfly phase, the next level

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:10%
of manifestation.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:10%
And some may tell you that
this is impossible for us

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.120 align:middle line:10%
to accomplish.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:10%
But actually, every
religious tradition

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:10%
speaks of this incredible
transformation.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:10%
And in Tibet, they tell of this
transformation even occurring

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:10%
in modern times.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.680 align:middle line:10%
So we're encouraged to believe
that we all can ultimately

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:10%
attain this.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, the
Tibetans teach that we

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:10%
won't be able to
leave Earth until we

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:10%
do attain this remarkable
rainbow body of light.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:10%
So it might be wise
for us to consider

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:10%
how we can incorporate some of
these teachings into our life.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we're going
to be discussing here.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:10%
First, we're making
the correspondence

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:10%
between the Tibetan
rainbow body of light

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:10%
and the rainbow body of
the resurrected Jesus.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.144 align:middle line:10%
And we're seeing that there
is, in fact, this crossover.

00:11:01.144 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there is
a tradition that

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:10%
says that during
those 18 missing

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:10%
years between the
age of 12 and 30,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:10%
that Jesus was in fact in Tibet,
where he might in fact have

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:10%
been learning this Tibetan
rainbow body tradition

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:10%
and learning how to
activate these latent

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:10%
capabilities within us.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:10%
In my work, what
I have established

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.720 align:middle line:10%
is that, once these Lamas
attain the rainbow body,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:10%
they're able to travel
throughout the cosmos.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:10%
The Tibetans teach that
the rainbow body teaching

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:10%
didn't come from Earth, that,
in fact, it's taught in 13 star

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:10%
systems, including our own.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:10%
And once we attain
the rainbow body,

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:10%
they say we're able to freely
travel from Sol, our star

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:10%
system, to Sirius, or Orion,
or Cygnus, or the Pleiades,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:10%
or any of these
other star systems

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:10%
that are mentioned
repeatedly in ancient myth

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:10%
and sacred tradition.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:10%
How do they travel to
these star systems?

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:10%
Well, the idea is that
the rainbow body itself

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:10%
is, in fact, capable of
opening what we today

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:10%
call a wormhole, an
interdimensional or

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:10%
interstellar transportation
system that takes us

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:10%
from point A in the universe
to point B as if there's

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:10%
nothing in between.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:10%
So just imagine that what
we're all walking around

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.260 align:middle line:10%
in and in our earthly bodies is
this magnificent mechanism that

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:10%
can be transformed that will
enable us then to travel

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:10%
throughout the cosmos.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:10%
Jesus spoke about
our perfection.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:10%
He says, "I tell you the truth.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:10%
It is hard for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.404 align:middle line:10%
It's easier for a
camel," he said,

00:12:42.404 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:10%
"to go through the
eye of a needle

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:10%
than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of God."

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:10%
I believe that that eye of the
needle that he's referring to

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:10%
is, in fact, the open mouth
or gate of the wormhole.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:10%
And Jesus is giving
us clues, perceptions

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.530 align:middle line:10%
about how to enter that
gateway by telling us

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:10%
that our human cargo,
our body, is going

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:10%
to have to be dissolved,
to use the Tibetan term,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:10%
or transformed,
transmuted, or resurrected,

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:10%
to use the Christian
term, before it

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:10%
goes through this
gateway or this portal.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:10%
In this beautiful
painting by Salvador Dali,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:10%
we see that Jesus has this
rainbow energy around his body.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:10%
He's neither fully
in this dimension,

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.790 align:middle line:10%
nor is he fully in
the other dimension.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:10%
He's in an intermediate phase.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:10%
This is because
Christianity insists

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:10%
that once Jesus attained
his resurrection body,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:10%
he could phase back and
forth between the material

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:10%
and the immaterial world.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:10%
Just imagine doing that.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:10%
What had happened
in this conversation

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:10%
is that the rich man had
told Jesus that he had always

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:10%
followed his word.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:10%
And he wanted to know, well,
what else is there to do?

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:10%
And Jesus told him to
follow the commandments.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:10%
The commandments are,
"Love with all your heart,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:10%
with all your soul,
and with all your mind.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:10%
This is the first and
greatest commandment.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:10%
And the second is like unto it.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:10%
Love your neighbor as
yourself," Jesus taught.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:10%
"All the law and
the prophets hang

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:10%
on these two commandments."

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:10%
This, according to
Christian teaching,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:10%
is the secret of eternal life.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:10%
It is the secret of
how we ultimately

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:10%
manifest our true
capabilities as human

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:10%
and access our divine selves.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:10%
We have to become beings of
pure light and pure love.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.957 align:middle line:10%
The rich man had
insisted that he always

00:14:36.957 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:10%
kept these commandments,
and he wanted

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:10%
to know what else was required.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:10%
Jesus then told him-- and
here's the punchline--

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:10%
if thou will be perfect--
meaning whole, holy, complete,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:10%
and compassionate-- go
and sell what you've got.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:10%
Give it to the poor.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:10%
Then you'll have
treasure and heaven,

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:10%
and you can come and follow me.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:10%
In my view, what
Jesus is saying is

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:10%
that we want to take our
worry and our energy off

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:10%
of the earthly immaterial
realm and put it

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:10%
onto our future selves as
a whole and complete being.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:10%
And then we will be
able to follow him

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:10%
through the eye of the
needle, through the wormhole.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:10%
So how do we lift this rainbow
body within us and get whole?

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:10%
That's the ultimate question.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:10%
We have all heard the term
that nobody's perfect.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Our culture teaches that.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:10%
We're taught that people
cannot become perfect.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, why try?

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you become whole
and holy, people say.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:10%
That's ridiculous.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:48.090 align:middle line:10%
To me, what is ridiculous
is listening to or believing

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:10%
anyone who tells
you not to strive

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:10%
for this ultimate
wholeness and holiness.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:10%
For, in striving, we
actually can attain or become

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:10%
more whole and complete.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:10%
And we just might
surprise ourselves

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:10%
with what we're capable of.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:10%
In my path and in my
tradition, my research,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:10%
I have used the tarot as one
way of opening up the path.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:10%
In fact, that's the
meaning of the word tarot

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:10%
is it means the way or the path.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:10%
And the tarot deck is
separated into 22 cards.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:10%
It begins with the
first card, the fool,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:10%
and ends with the 21st
card, which is the world.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:10%
The idea is that we all start
out as a purely innocent being.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:10%
And then through the course
of our earthly travels

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:10%
and our earthly quest,
we encounter challenges.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:10%
We encounter dilemmas
that must be overcome.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:10%
Many traditions
teach us that it's

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:10%
our higher self or our angelic
self that first sat down

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:10%
with us before our
earthly incarnation,

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:10%
and we chose all of the
challenges and the dilemmas

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:10%
that we face in our world.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:10%
And they're all designed
for us to perfect our souls.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.835 align:middle line:10%
So we all begin with the
innocence of the fool.

00:17:10.835 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:10%
And we're all ultimately looking
for this eye of the needle

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:10%
where we are able to
ascend into a higher

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:10%
realm at the end of
our earthly lives.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:10%
And in the tarot, we can see
that the eye of the needle

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:28.550 align:middle line:10%
is shown as a rainbow mandorla,
or almond-shaped gateway.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:10%
The tarot is separated
then into four suits.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:10%
Water, fire, air, and earth.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:10%
These are the four
basic elements

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:10%
that the alchemists taught
all of earthly manifestations

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:10%
are made out of,
including our bodies.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:10%
So we're always playing
with these four elements--

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:10%
water, fire, air, and earth--
symbolized in the tarot

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:10%
by the cups, the wands,
the swords, and the disks.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:10%
The ultimate goal
in the tarot is

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:10%
to enjoy what's called the sun
card, or joy and prosperity.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:10%
When I first started studying
and utilizing the tarot

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:10%
and reading professionally
before people in the 1990s,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:10%
I was always trying
to guide people

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:10%
to this place of joy,
prosperity, and happiness, here

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:10%
symbolized by the sun card.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:10%
And I would point out
that what we see here

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:10%
are a man and a woman
in a garden scene, which

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:10%
is meant to represent
the Garden of Eden.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:10%
Behind them, you see
the primordial mountain.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:10%
And then you see this beautiful
sun above the mountain.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:10%
And this represents to
the ancient Egyptians

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:10%
the place where our souls
originally came from.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:10%
And of course, in
the Old Testament

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:10%
this is referred to
as the Garden of Eden.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:10%
What I never noticed
for a number of years

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:10%
is that the couple were
standing in a rainbow ring.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't until I started
studying the rainbow body

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:10%
that I actually noticed this
peculiar feature of the card.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:10%
And with that realization
came a sudden thought.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:10%
What if all of us are always
standing in our rainbow body?

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:10%
What if we're always
in the rainbow ring?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And what if our quest is simply
to learn to raise that ring

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:10%
or to lift that vibration,
since the word ring

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:10%
is a play or a pun on vibration.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:10%
Seemed to me that the Lamas who
have attained the rainbow body

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:10%
have learned to do something
that we're all learning to do.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:10%
That is, they wear their
rainbow body on the outside.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:10%
We wear ours on the inside.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:10%
And part of our
quest is to learn

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:10%
to flip this scenario,
to begin to act

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:10%
as if we are these whole,
holy, and complete beings.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:10%
What would your
life be like if you

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:10%
were closer to attaining
ultimate wholeness or holiness?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:10%
What if you were
ultimately, say, at 290?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:10%
What would your
life be like then?

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:10%
What would you be
doing differently

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:10%
mentally, physically,
spiritually,

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:10%
and emotionally that
you're presently not doing?

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:10%
This is a very important
imaginative kind of challenge,

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:10%
but also a process that we
all need to go through here.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:10%
We need to begin to
identify with our more

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:10%
whole, holy, complete,
and divine selves.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:10%
And in so doing, we're able
to lift the rainbow ring.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:10%
The fundamental dilemma most
of us find ourselves in though,

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:10%
however, is symbolized
by the 8 of Swords card.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:10%
In the tarot, the 8
of Swords symbolizes

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:10%
a person who is trapped
or feeling confined.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:10%
What we see here
are two people who

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:10%
are standing on the edge
of a gap or a precipice.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:10%
All the good stuff they
want is on the other side

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:10%
of the gap or precipice.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:10%
But there's no bridge.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:10%
There's no rope.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:10%
There's no ladder.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:10%
There's no apparent
way for them to get

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:10%
from point A, where
they're at now, to point

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:10%
B, where they want to go.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:10%
What we see are eight
swords sticking up

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.997 align:middle line:10%
out of the ground
on the other side.

00:20:59.997 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:10%
Something the tarot taught
me is that, while those

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:10%
look like swords, those
are actually words.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.160 align:middle line:10%
Because when you take the first
letter S off the word swords,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:10%
you're left with words.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:10%
Words, of course, are
vibrations, which takes us back

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:10%
to this idea of rings, or
tones, or vibration, once again.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:10%
The words or vibration that
often keep us locked in place

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:10%
are usually worry, fear,
stress, anxiety, doubt.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:10%
But the really big
words or vibration

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:10%
that keep us locked in
place are disbelief-related.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:10%
We don't believe we can
go from where we are now

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:10%
to where we want to be.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, we don't.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:10%
In fact, as we stand on
this gap or precipice,

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:10%
we basically have two choices.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:10%
One, we could go back up
around where we came from for,

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:10%
say, three, six, eight
weeks, months, or years,

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:10%
which ultimately will bring
us right back to where we are.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And then we have
two more choices.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:10%
We can go back
around the other way

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:10%
three, six, eight weeks, months,
or years, which will bring us

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:10%
right back to where we are.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.652 align:middle line:10%
Or we can find a way to get
across to the other side.

00:22:12.652 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:10%
And the question is
how do we do that?

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:10%
How do we bridge the gap?

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.527 align:middle line:10%
This scene might be familiar
to some of you watching.

00:22:22.527 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:10%
You might have seen it
in the movie "Indiana

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:10%
Jones and the Last Crusade."

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm convinced
that the director,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:10%
George Lucas and
Steven Spielberg,

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:10%
who created that
film must have seen

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:10%
this depiction here
by Clive Barrett

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient Egyptian tarot.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:10%
Because this scene was precisely
duplicated in the movie

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.647 align:middle line:10%
"Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade."

00:22:42.647 --> 00:22:43.480 align:middle line:10%
Remember that movie?

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:10%
That's the one
where Sean Connery

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:10%
played Indiana's father.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:10%
And in the story,
Indiana and his father

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:10%
were racing the Nazis
for the Holy Grail.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.900 align:middle line:10%
They ultimately came to
this Grail temple, which

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:10%
happened to be Petra in Jordan.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.650 align:middle line:10%
The Nazis show up, and
they shoot Sean Connery

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:10%
and tell Indiana
that if he wants

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:10%
to save his father's
life, that he will

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:10%
go get the Grail for the Nazis.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.060 align:middle line:10%
And so what happens
in the story is

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:10%
that Indiana goes through
several trials and tribulations

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:10%
until he comes to
exactly this place, where

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:10%
he's standing on
the edge of this gap

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:10%
and the Holy Grail is hidden
in a cave on the other side.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And when Indiana got there, he
realized that he couldn't jump

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:10%
across, he couldn't use his
whip, he couldn't use his gun,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:10%
or beat somebody up-- all the
usual ways that he used to get

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:10%
what he wanted in those films.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:10%
Indy realized that
the only way to get

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:10%
across there is he had
to get out of his head,

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:10%
and he had to go into his
heart and focus on what

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:10%
it was that he did want.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:10%
And what he wanted was
not to get the Grail.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:10%
What he wanted was to
save his father's life.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:10%
And as Indiana united
his heart and his mind,

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:10%
suddenly he got the motivation,
and the inspiration,

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:10%
and the trust and belief to
take a first step of faith,

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:10%
whereupon a solid but
invisible bridge manifested.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:10%
Indiana steps onto the bridge,
crosses over this gap or chasm,

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:10%
gets across to the other side,
scoops up a handful of dirt,

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:10%
and throws it over
to mark his trail.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:10%
He gets the Grail, and he
saves his father's life.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, the thing is is
that, individually, we

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:10%
come to this place in
many different forms.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:10%
The words, and the disbelief,
and the worry that we're

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:10%
talking about can be financial.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:10%
It can be having to
do with relationships.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.860 align:middle line:10%
It could have to do with career.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:10%
It could have to
do with anything.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:10%
But the technique for overcoming
the gap and these vibrations

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:10%
that keep us locked
in place is the same.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:10%
We have to focus on
what it is we do want,

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:10%
not what we don't want.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:10%
Then the second thing
is we have to be

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:10%
able to motivate ourselves.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:10%
Because literally, Indiana was
in a life and death situation.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:10%
In our careers, in
our relationships,

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:10%
in other areas where
we experience the gap,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:10%
we might not feel like we're
in a life and death situation.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:10%
But in a way, we really are.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Because if we stay on
this side of the gap,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:10%
we're never going to
attain our full potential

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:10%
to become more whole, complete,
and indeed, holy beings.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:10%
Before we move on,
we want to note

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:10%
that the two figures who are
standing on the side of the gap

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:10%
have donkeys behind them
that are carrying cargo.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:10%
This is what Jesus was
saying a moment ago,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.400 align:middle line:10%
is that we've got to let that
stuff go, lighten our load

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:10%
as we begin to take our
steps through the gap.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:10%
Ignorance is the name
that the Bible gives

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:10%
to the gulf or chasm of
darkness separating us

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:10%
from God and the life and
benefits of knowing, trusting,

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:10%
and indeed, loving God.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:10%
So here's what happens
internally when

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:10%
we get into these situations.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:10%
If we could look into Indiana
Jones' mind at that moment

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:10%
when he's on this
side of the gap,

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:10%
we would see a split
in his consciousness.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:32.220 align:middle line:10%
We would see his male side,
his logical side, telling him,

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.150 align:middle line:10%
Indy, there's no way you
can get across the gap.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.311 align:middle line:10%
It's too far.

00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:37.310 align:middle line:10%
You can't use your whip.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.018 align:middle line:10%
You can't use your
gun, beat somebody up,

00:26:39.018 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:10%
or steal something--
all the usual masculine,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:10%
left brain ways that
you've used in these movies

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:10%
to get what you want.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:10%
His female side, his more
emotional or intuitive side,

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:10%
is shown here on
the bed in tears.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:10%
She knows that there's a
magical way, a spiritual way

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:10%
to get across.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:10%
But his male side
isn't listening.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:10%
And this is what has to happen
in all of these situations,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:10%
whether it's career,
family, financial,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is, or spiritual.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:10%
We have to get our male side
and our female side unified

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:10%
and working together on
one goal, on, in fact,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.852 align:middle line:10%
the same goal.

00:27:22.852 --> 00:27:24.310 align:middle line:10%
Something that the
tarot has taught

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.670 align:middle line:10%
me is that in a
traditional relationship,

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:10%
the male feels like his
primary responsibility

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:10%
towards the female is to provide
for her and to protect her.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Behind that, though, she
has a really important need.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:10%
She wants him to pay
attention to her.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.140 align:middle line:10%
The male side looks at
situations, especially

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.904 align:middle line:10%
spiritual endeavors,
and says, look,

00:27:46.904 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:10%
we really don't have a lot of
time for that kind of thing.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to help
us make any more money.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to
bring in the things

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:10%
that the male side
really likes to focus on.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:10%
And consequently, the female
side isn't getting fed.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:10%
She's not being
paid attention to.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:10%
And the male side is
actually depriving himself

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:10%
of the extraordinary
capacity and capabilities

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:10%
of the female side,
her spiritual intuitive

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:10%
capabilities and creativity
that can help achieve

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:10%
the goal that we are seeking.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:10%
This is where the male
side likes to live,

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:10%
here represented
by the 9 of Swords.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:10%
The masculine side is the
worrier side of ourselves.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:10%
It's also the warrior.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:10%
And you notice that the word
worry and warrior are just

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.960 align:middle line:10%
one letter apart.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:10%
The male side likes to
sit on the couch at home

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.505 align:middle line:10%
and think about all the
worry, fear, stress, anxiety,

00:28:38.505 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:10%
and doubt-- all the reasons
we can't do something.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:10%
You might notice that beside
him is the Egyptian symbol

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:10%
of the ankh, or key of life.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:10%
The male side is challenged
to pick up that key.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:53.600 align:middle line:10%
But he never does, because he's
too busy focusing on everything

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:10%
we don't want to have happen.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, the card on
the right, the 9 of Disks,

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:10%
symbolizes where the female
likes to focus her time.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:10%
It's the same cave.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:10%
But now it's filled with
nine golden disks, which

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:10%
represent ultimate
prosperity and manifestation

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:10%
of actual physical
cash in the real world.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:10%
But internally, it represents
new ideas, or talents,

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:10%
or abilities that are within
us that are always latent

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:10%
and are waiting to come online.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:10%
How do we bring them online?

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:10%
By overcoming the worry, fear,
stress, anxiety, and doubt.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:10%
So here's the dilemma
that all of us face.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:10%
We're in the same cave.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:10%
There's two aspects
of ourselves.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:10%
And we have to decide which one
of these we're going to feed.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:10%
But the idea is ultimately
we want both of them

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.147 align:middle line:10%
focused on the same thing.

00:29:46.147 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:10%
And usually, what that
means is that the male side

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:10%
is going to have to go through
a period of retraining.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.730 align:middle line:10%
He's going to have to listen
to that female side, which

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:10%
is what we see happening in
this card, the 7 of Wands.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.880 align:middle line:10%
When we look at
this at first, we

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:10%
see the man and woman
on the edge of a cliff.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like he's
about to push her off.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:10%
And she's certainly
going to hurt herself

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:10%
if she falls off this cliff.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:10%
But if we blink and
look at it again,

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:10%
we might see
something different.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:10%
We might see that she, in
fact, is so strong that she's

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.430 align:middle line:10%
able to push back or
hold back this apparently

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:10%
stronger male force
long enough for her cat

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:10%
to come into the picture
to release this tension.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:10%
This is illustrating
the interplay

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:10%
of the male and
female within us,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:10%
where they begin this
process of dancing, in a way.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.270 align:middle line:10%
Because the third
way to look at this

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:10%
is that they are, in
fact, not in a struggle,

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:10%
in a shoving match.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:10%
They're dancing on
the edge of the cliff.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:10%
And what needs to
happen here is that they

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:10%
want to change the tune, or the
tone, or the tempo of the dance

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:10%
to get away from
that cliff, which

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.680 align:middle line:10%
is indeed what will happen.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:10%
So after we go through this
process of the push-pull,

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:10%
we then are in a position to
open up into the ultimate goal.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:10%
And what has to happen
here is that the male side

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.850 align:middle line:10%
has to get off of
the thunderstorms,

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:10%
off of the worry, fear,
stress, anxiety, and doubt,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:10%
and begin to fine tune and
focus its energy on raising

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:10%
our vibration.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:10%
Unifying the two, the inner
male and the inner female,

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.210 align:middle line:10%
and raising our
vibration, which is

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:10%
what we see happening
in this 3 of Wands card,

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:10%
where we see the
same man is now out

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the desert in a
triangle or a pyramid of power,

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:10%
focusing on, or meditating
on, the rising sun.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:10%
That sun, of course, symbolizes
joy, prosperity, and happiness.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:10%
And it represents the
new dawn or the new day.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:10%
And here's how we transmute
the negative energies

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:10%
or emotions of the worry, fear,
stress, anxiety, and doubt.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:10%
This is a real key aspect
of alchemy here, in fact.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:10%
Because ultimately,
what we want to do

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:10%
is raise our vibrations
symbolized by the rainbow.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:10%
There are actually three
parts to a rainbow.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:10%
A rainbow is composed of
water from the rain, the sun,

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:10%
and a third part, us, the
person that sees the rainbow.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.210 align:middle line:10%
So here we see
illustrated for us

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:10%
this process of transmutation,
where we actually

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:10%
use this energy of the
worry, fear, stress, anxiety,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:10%
and doubt and infuse it
with new light, new hope,

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:10%
to produce the rainbow.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.220 align:middle line:10%
So how do we do this?

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:10%
How do we go from 240 to 360?

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.060 align:middle line:10%
Here's my process.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:10%
What I encourage people
to do is to draw a circle

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:10%
as large as they can make
it on a piece of paper

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.940 align:middle line:10%
and draw a dot in the center.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:10%
This represents our
ultimate goal or our target.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.920 align:middle line:10%
We all start out,
as I said, at 240.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:10%
And we're trying
to get up to 360.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:10%
In our example here, let's
just say our next step for us,

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:10%
our next vibration, is 270.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.360 align:middle line:10%
So think about it this way.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:10%
Presently, you are
living your life at 240.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:10%
Everything you're doing
mentally, physically,

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.120 align:middle line:10%
spiritually, and
emotionally refers

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:10%
to your beliefs about yourself
and your capability at 240.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:10%
The things you
read, the things you

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:10%
think about, how
you feel physically,

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:10%
the foods you're eating, what
you're feeling emotionally,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:38.090 align:middle line:10%
your spiritual practices all
reflect your life at 240.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:10%
In order to get up
to 270, we're going

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.530 align:middle line:10%
to have to change those things.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:10%
Because when we're at
this higher vibration,

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:10%
we will be doing
different things mentally,

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.210 align:middle line:10%
physically, spiritually,
and emotionally

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:10%
than we're presently doing.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.990 align:middle line:10%
And each of us as individuals
have to figure out

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:10%
what are those things.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.510 align:middle line:10%
And you have to go
into your imagination

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.470 align:middle line:10%
and spend some time.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Just go crazy making a
list of all the things

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.320 align:middle line:10%
that you would imagine you'll
be doing when you're at 270

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.159 align:middle line:10%
that you're presently not doing.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:10%
What will you be reading?

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:10%
What new books or
new information

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:10%
will you be bringing
into your life?

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:10%
What new foods
might you be eating?

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.947 align:middle line:10%
You'll continue to do many
of the positive things you're

00:34:21.947 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:10%
already doing.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.570 align:middle line:10%
But what we're wanting
to focus on now

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:10%
are new positive
behaviors or activities

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:10%
that you will be doing
when you're at 270.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.420 align:middle line:10%
Some are going to
be really easy,

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:10%
like taking more
walks every day,

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:39.840 align:middle line:10%
or sleeping more, or
meditating more, or playing

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.440 align:middle line:10%
your instruments more, or
all those easy little things

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:10%
that you can do.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:10%
Some going to be perceived
to be more difficult,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:10%
like going to
Egypt, or fulfilling

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:10%
a life dream of building a home,
or something of that nature.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.550 align:middle line:10%
We still want to list
those things out.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:10%
Again, go wild.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.610 align:middle line:10%
What we want to do is
make four lists, actually,

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:10%
separating them into the four
elements-- mental, physical,

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:10%
spiritual, and emotional.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:10%
And if we can, come
up with 5, 10, 15, 20,

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.050 align:middle line:10%
25 different new
things that you'll

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:10%
enjoy doing mentally,
physically, spiritually,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:10%
and emotionally
when you're at 270.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:10%
Then once we have the
list, what we want to do

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:26.400 align:middle line:10%
is prioritize those lists
or separate them out

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:10%
from perceived easiest to
perceived most difficult.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:10%
Then what we want to do is
to start doing those things.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:40.570 align:middle line:10%
Because in doing them, we will
be acting as if we are already

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:10%
at this higher vibration.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:10%
The analogy I like to make
is to a singing crystal bowl.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:10%
When a person plays a singing
bowl, they take the bowl

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.430 align:middle line:10%
and they put it on a solid
platform, a floor, or a table.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:59.610 align:middle line:10%
Then they take out a wand,
typically, or a mallet.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.560 align:middle line:10%
And they begin to go
around the rim of the bowl.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.620 align:middle line:10%
At first, the bowl isn't
producing much of a sound.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.930 align:middle line:10%
It's trying to find its pitch.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.520 align:middle line:10%
But once the bowl
finds its pitch-- wow--

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.360 align:middle line:10%
it suddenly just
takes off and begins

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:10%
producing this amazing
vibration that fills up the room

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:10%
and begins to transform
everyone and everything

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.820 align:middle line:10%
in the vicinity of that bowl.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.720 align:middle line:10%
That bowl symbolizes
our Grail cup,

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.220 align:middle line:10%
as in the story
of Indiana Jones.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:10%
But it also ultimately
symbolizes us.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:10%
We are that bowl.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:10%
And what we're challenged with
doing is picking up that mallet

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:10%
and beginning to go
around the rim of our life

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:10%
and beginning to change the
little things that we're

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:10%
doing to know that we're going
to ultimately get a big wow

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:04.380 align:middle line:10%
moment when suddenly our bowl,
our life, just takes off.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
process that we're

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:10%
trying to make happen here.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:10%
And as our bowl-- as
our vibration takes off,

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:10%
we begin to magically influence
everyone and everything

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.580 align:middle line:10%
that we come into contact with.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, as in the
example of the bowl,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.040 align:middle line:10%
we don't know exactly
which new activity

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:10%
is going to be the one that
suddenly gives us the big wow.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:10%
We just need to trust that if
we begin doing these things

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:10%
and continue to do
these new things,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:10%
that big wow will be there.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:10%
And this is how
we gradually begin

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.330 align:middle line:10%
to build this higher vibration.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, your male side,
your logical side,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:10%
likes this process.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:10%
Because this isn't some
kind of patch of blue sky

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.590 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about here.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.630 align:middle line:10%
This is logical.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:10%
It makes sense.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:10%
Your male side has seen,
perhaps, the bowl happen.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.900 align:middle line:10%
And if not, perhaps you want
to Google or go on to YouTube

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.600 align:middle line:10%
and watch someone
playing a singing crystal

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:10%
bowl or a Tibetan bowl.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe you've seen the
example with a crystal glass.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.680 align:middle line:10%
The male side likes it,
because this is a process.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.320 align:middle line:10%
Your female side likes
this too, because she's

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.980 align:middle line:10%
waiting for the big wow moment.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:10%
She knows this is going happen.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, that mallet
that they use with the bowl

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.610 align:middle line:10%
is phallic.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:24.840 align:middle line:10%
It's masculine.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.270 align:middle line:10%
The bowl is feminine.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:10%
So this process unites
the male and female side.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.510 align:middle line:10%
And what ultimately is going
to unite your male side here

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.800 align:middle line:10%
is that he's waking up.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.290 align:middle line:10%
He's saying, oh, I get it.

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.550 align:middle line:10%
My female side, the
creative and intuitive side,

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:10%
wants to do all these
new things mentally,

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.910 align:middle line:10%
physically, spiritually,
and emotionally.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.090 align:middle line:10%
Because ultimately,
that is going

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:10%
to create a sense of
greater wholeness,

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.900 align:middle line:10%
and completion, and
ultimately, holiness.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.280 align:middle line:10%
The male side's not really
vibing with the holiness.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:10%
But he really likes the
idea of becoming more whole.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.100 align:middle line:10%
Because if we're
more whole, that

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:10%
is going to create greater
protection and greater

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:10%
prosperity than we're
presently enjoying.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.770 align:middle line:10%
And now the male side wakes
up and is like, oh, OK.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:10%
I've been preventing
the female side

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.830 align:middle line:10%
from doing all these new things
for fear that she might not

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:10%
do them correctly or might
fail in these new endeavors.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.510 align:middle line:10%
But now he sees that
this isn't engaging

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.650 align:middle line:10%
in frivolous behavior or new
things that could be risky.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:10%
This is all going towards
attaining a greater sense

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.930 align:middle line:10%
of wholeness and protection.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:37.500 align:middle line:10%
And now the male side
takes the brakes off,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.735 align:middle line:10%
takes the first step, gets
across the other side,

00:39:39.735 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:10%
and in fact, can't open
the gate fast enough

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:10%
to get to the other
side, and is now

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:49.070 align:middle line:10%
fully locked in with the
female side towards attaining

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.224 align:middle line:10%
this higher vibration.

00:39:51.224 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:10%
So as the male
side looks at this,

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:10%
he's all interested in this now.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:59.840 align:middle line:10%
Because this is a logical
and purposeful path.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's your male
side, by the way,

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:10%
that's either going to allow
you to make that list or not.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.630 align:middle line:10%
But I think most of you
watching this will be motivated

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.270 align:middle line:10%
to do this, because
the male side's seeing

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:15.040 align:middle line:10%
that this is going to
lead us to a better place.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:10%
So the male side
is going to make

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:10%
that list, that to-do list.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.340 align:middle line:10%
Then the next thing
is you're either

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:10%
going to do the things on
that list or you're not.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:10%
And I believe, again, you'll be
motivated to do these things,

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:10%
because the male side is the
side of ourselves that says,

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:10%
yes, we're going to do
these things or we're not.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And he'll be very motivated
to move as fast as we can

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.290 align:middle line:10%
up to this higher
vibration, because that

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.470 align:middle line:10%
means more, better, now.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.830 align:middle line:10%
And that's the motivation
of the male side.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:10%
The female side likes it,
because she's all along just

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.570 align:middle line:10%
wanted to become unified
with the male side

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:10%
and to attain a greater sense
of wholeness and holiness,

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.610 align:middle line:10%
if not divinity.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.020 align:middle line:10%
The thing here is that
once we get up to 270,

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:10%
once we begin raising our
vibration in this way,

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.980 align:middle line:10%
it's really going to
start to feed on itself

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:10%
and it's going to bring
a sense of wonder.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.750 align:middle line:10%
And my advice to you would
be just go crazy with this.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.947 align:middle line:10%
Make a long list
of these things,

00:41:14.947 --> 00:41:16.030 align:middle line:10%
and just start doing them.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Go crazy.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.840 align:middle line:10%
Make your friends wonder what
in the world is wrong with you.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.340 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.256 align:middle line:10%
Because suddenly you're
doing all these things

00:41:22.256 --> 00:41:23.700 align:middle line:10%
that are making you happy.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.550 align:middle line:10%
And try this.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:10%
Go nuts with this
for 30, 45, 60 days.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.420 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't like your
life at a higher vibration,

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:10%
enjoying greater prosperity
and a sense of wholeness,

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:10%
go back to what
you're doing now.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.415 align:middle line:10%
But I don't think you will.

00:41:39.415 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:10%
I think you're going to
just want to continue

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:10%
to build, and build, and build.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.710 align:middle line:10%
Because the idea is that
once you get up to 270,

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.170 align:middle line:10%
now 290 comes into sight.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:54.060 align:middle line:10%
And you can use the same
process to go from 270 to 290,

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.450 align:middle line:10%
up to 310.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And from there-- wow--
anything is possible.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:10%
What we've really done here is
opened a portal or a gateway

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.150 align:middle line:10%
for ourselves.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:10%
This is how I believe
Indiana actually

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.340 align:middle line:10%
got across that gateway in that
movie is he opened a wormhole.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:10%
He went from point A
to point B as if there

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:10%
was nothing in between.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.030 align:middle line:10%
He opened a wormhole.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:10%
And you can too.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
instant application

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.880 align:middle line:10%
of what I call stargate
metaphysics in your life, how

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.490 align:middle line:10%
we can use our belief
to open this portal

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.780 align:middle line:10%
or gateway for ourselves,
step through, and get across

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.110 align:middle line:10%
to the other side.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:10%
The key is, like Indiana,
we have to view ourselves

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:10%
in a life and death situation.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.890 align:middle line:10%
Because you no longer want
to live your life at 240.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.640 align:middle line:10%
Your list that
you're going to make

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.850 align:middle line:10%
is going to be so
exciting that you're

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:54.410 align:middle line:10%
going to motivate
yourself to get up to 270

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:58.030 align:middle line:10%
as quickly as you
can and to bring

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:00.730 align:middle line:10%
those blessings into your
life and to be able to share

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:10%
those blessings with
everyone and everything

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:10%
that you come into contact with.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:10%
So I hope you've enjoyed
this presentation.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:10%
I look forward to hearing
the results of your labors.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:10%
I hope you'll drop
me an email to let

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:10%
me know how this process
has worked for you.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:21.180 align:middle line:10%
And I commend you on
your quest to attain

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:10%
the greatest sense of wholeness
and holiness possible.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.820 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very
much for watching.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.397 align:middle line:90%
