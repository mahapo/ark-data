00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:02.651
<v Voiceover>There's an old Bob Dylan song where,</v>

2
00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:04.713
where he laughs before he starts playing

3
00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:07.221
and I always think about that laughter

4
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:08.840
before he starts playing, you know?

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.462
And sometimes, I rewind it and I just listen to him laugh.

6
00:00:11.462 --> 00:00:13.601
It's just this amazing, unexpected moment

7
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:15.965
because you're listening to listen to music,

8
00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.628
you know, you're not listening to listen to Bob Dylan laugh.

9
00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:21.204
And, that' magic, right there, that's magic.

10
00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:24.286
You are the magician, take them both, squeeze on it tight.

11
00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:26.044
Both hands in the air, like this.

12
00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:27.764
Everybody count to three for her.

13
00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:29.966
<v All>One, two, three.</v>

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.951
<v ->Blow on your hand, shake up here like this.</v>

15
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:35.512
Shake up here like this, shake like this.

16
00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:37.790
(children laughing)

17
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.871
Open your hands up wide, see how you did.

18
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.910
(children squealing and laughing)

19
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.342
Magic is creating a moment for someone else,

20
00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:49.319
where they forget that reality is reality.

21
00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.661
And, they actually question everything for a moment.

22
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:56.762
And, not in a scary way, but in the most exciting way,

23
00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:59.241
because, magic is an experience.

24
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.881
Magic is a total moment of being astonished,

25
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.382
and questioning what you believe.

26
00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:06.162
<v ->Count to three.
<v All>One, two, three.</v>

27
00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:08.791
<v ->Poof.</v>

28
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.905
(applause)

29
00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:10.729
<v ->Do you want to see more, say more.</v>

30
00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.788
(children cheering)

31
00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:15.639
<v ->You know, it's funny, it's funny,</v>

32
00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:18.780
'cause I left New York City to find something better

33
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.299
and I spent over a year and a half traveling

34
00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.081
and hitch hiking with my dog Cloud Kicker.

35
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.661
We went to all these towns, all these places

36
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.461
that people kept bragging about, you gotta go

37
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:29.322
to this place, 'cause you can be an artist there.

38
00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.341
You can create there, you gotta check this place out.

39
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.321
They're so open, you know, they're so free.

40
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.663
And, I went to all those places, every single one.

41
00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:39.423
And, it's funny after all these years,

42
00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:44.216
it all journeyed back to New York City.

43
00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:47.223
<v ->♫ Buy a little kingdom</v>

44
00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:50.034
♫ Free yourself from every symptom

45
00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:52.514
♫ On a golden road

46
00:01:52.514 --> 00:01:57.318
♫ Ain't what it seems, but if you got the ways and means

47
00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:02.192
♫ If you got the ways and means ♫

48
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.241
<v ->Every weekend I do multiple shows</v>

49
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:11.861
and there's only so much I can carry with my two hands.

50
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:14.321
And, the idea that I'm just strapping a suit jacket,

51
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:17.201
a top hat, and a suitcase, and I'm able to perform

52
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:21.061
a 40 minute show that's beat, after beat, after beat

53
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:23.518
of magic and comedy and fun.

54
00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.259
But, only having it within the lines of what you can carry

55
00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.347
is an amazing thing and I've worked really hard at that.

56
00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:31.927
Wave the magic wand, tap on my hand, ow.

57
00:02:31.927 --> 00:02:33.406
(children giggling)

58
00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:36.146
Count to three, one, two.
<v Audience>Three.</v>

59
00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:37.886
(mumbles)

60
00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.009
(clapping)

61
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.017
<v ->That's disgusting, I would never do that Owen.</v>

62
00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:45.457
Blow on my hand and say abracadabra.

63
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:46.477
<v ->Abracadabra.</v>

64
00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:49.606
<v ->And it's gone, whoever claps the loudest for Owen,</v>

65
00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:51.056
everyone say, yay Owen.

66
00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:54.364
One of the first weeks I went out and I found

67
00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:57.133
this bird right here, this is Mozzarella.

68
00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.773
Because I was taking a big risk with trying

69
00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:01.442
to do magic full time, I knew it was important

70
00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:04.682
to have a companion during my performances.

71
00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:06.442
I started talking to Mozzarella and I was saying

72
00:03:06.442 --> 00:03:09.462
to Mozzarella, like look dude we gotta be buddies, you know,

73
00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:13.022
and we gotta be friends and we're gonna be working together

74
00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:15.962
and we need to train and get this act together.

75
00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:18.551
And as I was talking to him I was saying,

76
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.960
I hope that this is something that you really wanna do.

77
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.160
Mozzarella puffed up and started singing to me

78
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.679
and I took it as this big sign of hope that I might be

79
00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.038
on the right track and as silly as it was to talk to,

80
00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:34.608
was like a really important thing that night.

81
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.973
I have a little space that I rent out

82
00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:42.573
and I do all my sewing in there, you know, if I have to

83
00:03:42.573 --> 00:03:45.403
paint or if I have to build something, it's a place away

84
00:03:45.403 --> 00:03:47.635
away from home so I can make all that dust and dirt

85
00:03:47.635 --> 00:03:50.935
and leave it there when I leave.

86
00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:54.595
One of the parts of my show that I am the most excited about

87
00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:58.275
and, is the opening of my show where I have signs drop

88
00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:00.635
and flags come out and flowers come out.

89
00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:02.835
And, I just wanted to show you guys a little

90
00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:05.185
behind-the-scenes real quick this.

91
00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:07.522
The signs are actually pizza boxes

92
00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:12.021
from our local pizzeria and I cut them up into strips

93
00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:14.823
and I just used some tape to tape them together

94
00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:16.643
and I just painted them, that's all they are.

95
00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:21.003
I went through a lot of trouble to find a can like this,

96
00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:23.883
because I wanted something that would not only match the

97
00:04:23.883 --> 00:04:26.283
suitcase, but also the colors I use during my magic show.

98
00:04:26.283 --> 00:04:28.547
So, I spent the whole,

99
00:04:28.547 --> 00:04:32.564
I spent the whole summer building into this can

100
00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.185
and I wanted to fit as much insanity into this can as I

101
00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:40.095
(tapping)

102
00:04:42.025 --> 00:04:43.445
into this can, for example

103
00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:46.526
(tapping)

104
00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:48.079
Stop that.

105
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.907
(tapping)

106
00:04:49.907 --> 00:04:54.761
I, and I spent all summer, and this whole can now

107
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.960
is self contained, it does all kinds of craziness.

108
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.592
(tapping)

109
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:04.583
Stop it and anyways, there's all kinds of stuff I can do

110
00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:08.103
with this can and I spent a good three months on it.

111
00:05:08.103 --> 00:05:11.383
I even added a little bit of a, I even added a little bit

112
00:05:11.383 --> 00:05:13.125
of fire, I don't know if I can do it, let's see.

113
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:16.265
Fire, come out.

114
00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:17.965
(laughs)

115
00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:28.580
(buzzing)

116
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:35.232
Wow.

117
00:05:35.232 --> 00:05:40.192
(buzzing and humming)

118
00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:48.605
Hmm, I gotta rewire this because,

119
00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:53.600
for some reason it's not, this is staying in focus here.

120
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.539
This is a monkey that I'm building.

121
00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.219
I can't own a real monkey, so my idea was if I could

122
00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:03.081
make a really live looking monkey it would be really cool.

123
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.501
He's made with wood and there's wine cork, carved wine cork

124
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:09.161
for his mouth and stuff, and then all the wire

125
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.334
is coat hangers that I just cut up.

126
00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:14.654
I hooked up all the motors into the microcontroller,

127
00:06:14.654 --> 00:06:17.094
it's running on a USB cable to my computer and

128
00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:20.854
on my computer I named my program, Mechanical Monkey Head.

129
00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:23.473
You know, hey monkey I'm the best magician

130
00:06:23.473 --> 00:06:24.915
in the world, right?

131
00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:27.688
Yeah and then, you know, he'll say yes and then,

132
00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.827
when I look away, he'll nod no or something,

133
00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:32.972
you know to the kids.

134
00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:37.982
In the beginning of when I started with electronics

135
00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:41.222
I was completely fascinated with these little capacitors

136
00:06:41.222 --> 00:06:43.242
and resistors that are built into circuits

137
00:06:43.242 --> 00:06:45.403
and I'm just like, I don't understand how this all works,

138
00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:47.565
you know, it's like crazy, it's a whole other system

139
00:06:47.565 --> 00:06:49.897
of artwork that I have no idea about.

140
00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:52.187
This is an honest, true story, like when I first,

141
00:06:52.187 --> 00:06:55.061
I was so excited to build this whole lightning machine.

142
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:58.383
I went onto the guts of a television and I stuck pliers in

143
00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:00.735
to take the suction cup off of the glass part.

144
00:07:00.735 --> 00:07:04.555
Having no idea that even if a television is turned off

145
00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:08.637
for months, it holds a huge charge of electricity.

146
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:12.360
So, I had no idea, so mind you I'm plying this off with

147
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.521
pliers and all of the sudden, this huge spark comes out and

148
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:19.524
my whole arm shot back and the pliers went across the room.

149
00:07:19.524 --> 00:07:22.724
It was really, really scary and you know,

150
00:07:22.724 --> 00:07:24.666
I learned a lot after that moment of it

151
00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:25.798
really researching every part.

152
00:07:25.798 --> 00:07:27.858
So, this was super dangerous and

153
00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:29.213
I probably won't build one of these again.

154
00:07:29.213 --> 00:07:32.132
(sparking)

155
00:07:32.132 --> 00:07:36.174
A lot of magic is kind of like a hand craft,

156
00:07:36.174 --> 00:07:38.674
like you have to actually make your stuff.

157
00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:41.256
Like, you can't just, I mean if you wanna just go

158
00:07:41.256 --> 00:07:44.916
to the magic store or like, you know, and buy, you know

159
00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:47.426
props, you know, that's cool, you know, whatever.

160
00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:49.428
That's kind of how you get started, but then like

161
00:07:49.428 --> 00:07:52.688
eventually, it becomes like music or any other art field

162
00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:54.308
where you wanna start creating your own.

163
00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:59.208
There's not a lot of supply, you know, and that excites me,

164
00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:01.720
because I wanna be one of the suppliers.

165
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.484
But, a supplier of imagination and new ideas

166
00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:10.474
and of new comedy and secretly, you know,

167
00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:15.486
adding all my knowledge of electronics.

168
00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:17.026
Now, I'm gonna pick a few people.

169
00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:20.136
(children laughing)

170
00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:22.459
I said flowers out, not on the floor.

171
00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:26.449
(children laughing)

172
00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:29.781
As you can see, I am the world's greatest magician.

173
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:32.643
(children laughing)

174
00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:35.703
Stop that, sorry about that, now, as I was saying.

175
00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:39.633
(children laughing)

176
00:08:42.337 --> 00:08:45.142
Everyone say, flags up.
<v Audience>Flags up.</v>

177
00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:47.520
(children laughing)

178
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.553
Let me feel good, clap so loud if you want--

179
00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:52.993
It's all about reinforcing a kid's natural instinct

180
00:08:52.993 --> 00:08:56.334
to believe, and I believe that each labored over routine,

181
00:08:56.334 --> 00:08:59.454
each hand made prop, each gesture of controlled chaos

182
00:08:59.454 --> 00:09:01.928
in my performance sends this message to them

183
00:09:01.928 --> 00:09:04.330
in a louder voice than I could ever project in words.

184
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.811
Take a deep breath.

185
00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.890
And yes, my own hands have labored over these props.

186
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.210
I've spent hours building, practicing, honing, inventing,

187
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.850
adapting, but in reality Mario the Magician is the creation

188
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.570
of every child I've ever performed for.

189
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.570
They've molded my character, they've taught me

190
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.812
to speak their language.

191
00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:26.412
(audience cheers)

192
00:09:26.412 --> 00:09:29.915
Sometimes after a show, I'll put on that old Dylan song.

193
00:09:29.915 --> 00:09:34.366
And, it's funny 'cause I realize now, I never found magic.

194
00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:35.687
Magic found me.

195
00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:38.526
♫ Good time

196
00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:42.366
♫ Had a real good time

197
00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:46.226
♫ Real, real good time

198
00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:50.247
♫ A hell yeah, a good time

199
00:09:50.247 --> 00:09:54.206
♫ Had a real good time

200
00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:58.126
♫ Had a real good time

201
00:09:58.126 --> 00:10:01.966
♫ Real, real good time

202
00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:06.787
♫ A hell yeah good time

203
00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:09.767
♫ Good time

204
00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:13.588
♫ Had a real good time

205
00:10:13.588 --> 00:10:17.389
♫ Real, real good time

206
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:21.981
♫ Had a real good time ♫
