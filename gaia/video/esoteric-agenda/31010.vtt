00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>The more humanity
strays from its origin,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.645 align:middle line:84%
the more we deny our
bond with nature.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:10.008 align:middle line:84%
The farther from
perfection we become.

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:84%
We are the only creatures on the
planet use symbols in reference

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:90%
to something else.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.835 align:middle line:10%
We use symbols for
absolutely everything

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:10%
the mind can conceive of.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.863 align:middle line:10%
There is at least one
word or icon or gesture

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:24.362 align:middle line:10%
to insinuate everything our
five senses can detect, and then

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.275 align:middle line:10%
some.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But along with this
beautiful gift comes a flaw.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:10%
Most people are unwilling
to seek and create

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:10%
their own interpretations
of these symbols.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they blindly
submit to preconceived

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
definitions and connotations
given by sources unknown.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.659 align:middle line:84%
Because of this,
many things have

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.617 align:middle line:84%
been predetermined in
our understanding of life

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:90%
without our knowledge.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.964 align:middle line:84%
Words can be perverted and
used to manipulate rather than

00:01:50.964 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:90%
to inform.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Symbols can be used to
segregate rather than unite.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.228 align:middle line:84%
And those given the
responsibility and authority

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:01.459 align:middle line:84%
to disseminated
information to the public

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.435 align:middle line:84%
possess the ability to do
with it what they choose.

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:06.926 align:middle line:90%
Listen carefully.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Every 26,000 years,
our solar system

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:84%
passes through the
12 zodiac signs.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:10%
Ancient civilizations such as
the Hopi, Cherokee, Apache,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:10%
and the Mayans were aware
of this great cycle,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:10%
and developed calendars
according to it.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
This cycle stems from
many different occurrences

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
in nature, such as the
sun's orbit around Alcyon,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
the central star
of the Pleiades,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
as well as the 260-day
cycle of human gestation.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
This cycle is broken
down into five subcycles

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of 5,125 years each, which were
thought to have their own age.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
The Aztec calendar, or
the Mesoamerican Sunstone,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
depicted each cycle
being destroyed

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:90%
by one of the five elements.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:10%
The cycle we are currently in is
the Age of the Fifth Sun-- 3113

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:10%
BC to 2012 AD.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
More precisely, this great
cycle ends December 21, 2012.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Mayan cultures and civilizations
were aware of this end date.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And Nostradamus even prophesied
great changes in this time.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Four Earth, which
we are currently in,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is also known as movement,
shift, evolution,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Living Maya timekeepers
proclaim that the Earth

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
has been through fire,
earth, air, and water.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
The final element
is ether, or center.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi believe that the
fourth world of destruction

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
closes and the
fifth world of peace

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:90%
begins on December 21, 2012.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
This great cycle is broken down
into what the Mayans believed

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:90%
to be 13 baktuns.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Earth began the
13th baktun in 1618,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
which was known as the
triumph of materialism,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Time
of Great Forgetting,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
in the prediction that
humanity will lose awareness

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of their true bond
with nature by means

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:90%
of external possessions.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
This is where ego and domination
become the predominant ambition

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
of the civilized world.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly,
this time frame

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
was precisely when the worldwide
coordination of Pope Gregory

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
the Eighth forced the
12-month calendar, as well

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
as the first mechanical
clock, onto indigenous people.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
This is what is known
as the error in time.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:10%
Before the inception of these
two instruments by the Roman

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:10%
Catholic Church, each year was
divided into 13 moon cycles

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:10%
with 28 days each.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:10%
But the most detrimental
part of these two instruments

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:10%
is the insinuation that time is
something external, something

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.620 align:middle line:10%
inorganic and outside the body
that we must watch and obey.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:10%
The seventh-century
Mayan prophet Pacal Votan

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:10%
left a powerful message
for future generations--

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:10%
if humanity wishes
to save itself

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:10%
from biospheric
destruction, it must return

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:10%
to living in natural time.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:10%
He also foretold of our
accelerated technological

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:10%
society and the damage of
our collective divergence

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:10%
from natural law in exchange
for material values.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Astrology and the
study of the heavens

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
are as old as
civilization itself.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the past
several thousand years,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
new religions have all but
replaced the pagan religions

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:90%
of prior years.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Man has always been so
thoroughly fascinated

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
by these objects in the sky that
they have formed constellations

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:90%
for them and gave them stories.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:84%
In Greek mythology, these
were personified as the gods.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
We notice in structures
that still stand to this day

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
that the most ancient
of civilizations

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
put forth more
wealth, power, time,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and effort into the
locations of the stars

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:90%
than any other practice.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:84%
This is commonly written
off a simple curiosity.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is becoming
clearer by the day

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
as we close in on the zero
year of December 21, 2012.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It is a common misperception
that the pagan religion

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:90%
is rarely practiced today.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, paganism
in its evolution

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:84%
is the most widely practiced
form or philosophy of religion.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
You may ask yourself,
how is this possible?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The answer is
hidden in nearly all

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
of our current
popular religions.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
But who would have the
time, power, or desire

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to integrate the seemingly
long-gone philosophy

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
in such popular
opposite denominations?

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Adam Weishaupt was
born on February 6, 1748,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
in Ingolstadt, a city
in Bayern, Germany.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:84%
This interesting character
was the son of a rabbi,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and converted to Catholicism
after his father's death.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:84%
After studying French
philosophers such as Voltaire,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
he learned theology and
the mystery religions

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:90%
in the French royal court.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
World-famous banker
Mayer Amschel Rothschild

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Rothschild
dynasty chose Weishaupt

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
to create the Coven of Golden
Dawn, which is to this day

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Rothschild's private coven.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Amschel Rothschild, for
those who are unaware,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
instigated the American
Revolution, America's supposed

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:90%
liberation from Britain.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Rothschild instructed
Weishaupt to create

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the Ancient Illuminated
Seers of Bavaria.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
This is better known as the
Order of the Illuminati.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:10%
The name means the
bearer of light,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:10%
the illuminated or
enlightened one, which is also

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:10%
another name for Lucifer.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The Areopagite, or tribunal,
was the inner circle of people

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in this supreme order, and
were the only ones privy

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:90%
to the secret meetings.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
In Nesta Webster's book "World
Revolution," she states,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
"The art of illuminism lay
in enlisting dupes as well

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
as adepts, and by encouraging
dreams of honest visionaries

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
or the schemes of
fanatics, by flattering

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
the vanity of ambitious details,
by working unbalanced brains,

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:84%
or by playing on such
passions as greed and power

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.530 align:middle line:84%
to make men of
totally divergent aims

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
serve the secret
purpose of the sect.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
People with money were
welcomed, but kept oblivious

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:90%
of actual secrets.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
The purpose is to
win power and riches,

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
to undermine secular or
religious government,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and to attain the
masters of the world."

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the order was
and still is to one day

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
deliver the human race
from all other religions

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:90%
and into a single religion.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Progression through the
political and religious

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
hierarchy was
obtained by blackmail,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
in the form of bribing
people in power

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:90%
with sex from local prostitutes.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
In the 16th and 17th century,
high-ranking officials

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.300 align:middle line:84%
in political or
religious organizations

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
were liable to be sentenced
to death for such acts.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
In 1780, Baron Franz Friedrich
Knigge was also recruited.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
He was the most
instrumental person

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:84%
in the marriage of the
Masons and the Illuminati.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
This allowed the Illuminati
to expand rapidly

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:90%
with the use of Masonic lodges.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
On August 29, 1781,
Congress of Wilhelmsbad

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:90%
declared the alliance official.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Those in attendance
were put under oath

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
never to reveal what took
place in that meeting.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Comte de Virieu, a Mason from
Martiniste Lodge at Lyons,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:84%
was questioned about the
meeting upon his arrival home.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:10%
He stated, "I can only
tell you that all of this

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:10%
is much more serious
than you think.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:10%
The conspiracy
which is being woven

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:10%
is so well thought-out that
it will be, so to speak,

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:10%
impossible for the monarchy
and the church to escape it."

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
He later denounced
the Illuminati.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Sir John Dee.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
John Dee was a servant of Queen
Elizabeth Tudor of the Tudor

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:90%
dynasty.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
He was the head of the
British Secret Service, MI5.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:10%
He was also known for the
practice of black magic,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:10%
and his affiliation
with occult rituals.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Occult means hidden
within conscious realms.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
If you are unaware of
the occult paganism's

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
dominance in the world to
this day, pay close attention.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Pagan symbols, gods,
rituals, and doctrines

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
are the basis for
most every religion

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:90%
practiced throughout the world.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
symbol of the cross

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:84%
is derived from the
vertical masculine line

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and the horizontal feminine
line connecting in tantric union

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:90%
to create motion or vibration.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
As with all vibration,
energy is created

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and begins to spin
the cross, giving us

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.835 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of the swastika.

00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
This is why you see
the swastika used

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
in many ancient spiritual
or religious images.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
As said before,
pantheistic rituals

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
are prevalent in all
monotheistic religions today.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Circumcision is a
pagan rituals marking

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:90%
males in a ceremonial fashion.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.015 align:middle line:84%
Weddings are pagan by
nature in the wearing

00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
of a ring, which originally
symbolized the ring of Saturn.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Funerals follow the same
pagan-derived ritual

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
when a geometrical tomb
is placed over a grave

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to embody or
immortalize the spirit.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Baptism is a ritual to
submerge a child in holy water

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
to symbolize the
renewal of life,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:84%
just as rain
replenishes the Earth.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the meanings
of the holy grail

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:90%
is the womb and menstrual blood.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It also refers to the
emptiness of the mind, filled

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.800 align:middle line:84%
with unlimited life force--
the blood of Christ.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.290 align:middle line:84%
This ritual was taken over
by the patriarchal society.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Males could not give
life as women do,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
so to symbolize a
male giving life

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
was to draw blood, which
could only be done by injury.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt,
the goddess Isis

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
was the personification
of wisdom.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Pharaoh Akhenaten changed
the worship to himself

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
as he proclaimed himself
Amen-Ra, the sun god.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
The word "amen" at the end of a
prayer spawned from the praise

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:90%
given to Amen-Ra.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:10%
From there, the
Hebrews left Egypt

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:10%
and traveled north
into the Middle East,

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:10%
where they encountered the
Canaanites, who worshipped

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:10%
the god of Saturn, El.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
The merging of these
three gods became the name

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Holy Land today, which is
known as Isis Ra El, or Israel.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
98% percent of Judaism is based
around the worship of Saturn,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred day of
worship is Saturday.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
The worship practiced
on Sunday is

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
originated from the Egyptians
who worship the sun god.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Most people simply pass these
things off and never question

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
their origins, but
this just scratches

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the pagan
philosophy still present today.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It is not only
found in religions.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.235 align:middle line:84%
It is right here in
our very own backyard.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
On January 22, 1783,
Congress ratified a contract

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
stating that "all bills
of credit emitted,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
moneys borrowed,
and debts contracted

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.450 align:middle line:84%
by or under the
authority of Congress

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
before the assembling
of the United States

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
shall be deemed and considered
a charge against the United

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
States, for payment
and satisfaction

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:84%
whereof the United States
and the public face

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:90%
are hereby solemnly pledged."

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The party that the US owed
these loans to was King George.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I hope this helps paint
the picture for you

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
of how Great Britain funded
both sides of the revolution.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
To this day, Great Britain
still collects taxes

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
from the United
States via the IRS.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:84%
The IRS isn't even an agency of
the United States government.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It is an agency
of the IMF, which

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
is under the jurisdiction
of the United Nations.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:84%
The FCC, CIA, FBI, and NASA were
never part of the United States

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The US government only
holds shares of stock

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:90%
in the various agencies.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
John Brown was a Mason
and a Rosicrucian

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:84%
who was brought to power
by William Lloyd Garrison

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:90%
and Senator Charles Sumner.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
With the help of
the New York Times,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:84%
John Brown was built
up to be a hero

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:90%
in the anti-slavery movement.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Ulysses S Grant,
former president,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
was born Hiram S Grant
named after Hiram Abiff, who

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
is the most important historical
or mythological character

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:90%
in Freemasonry.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The name was given to him by his
father, Master Mason Jesse Root

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Grant.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.980 align:middle line:10%
Jesse Grant worked for
John Brown's father, then

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:10%
went on to work for EA Collins,
one of the 13 Illuminati

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:10%
bloodlines, according to
Fritz Springmeyer's research.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Ulysses S Grant was
brought to power rapidly

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:90%
with the help of EA Collins.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
From April 1861
to May 1864, Grant

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:84%
went from the rank of
private to Commander

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
in Chief of the
entire Union Army.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:10%
Once Grant was
appointed president,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:10%
his cabinet consisted
of eight Freemasons,

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:10%
including Alfonso Taft,
William Taft's father,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:10%
who was also the ancestor
of Bill Clinton, Jonas Mills

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:10%
Bundy, also one of the
supposedly Illuminati

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:10%
bloodlines, who was
presidential advisor to Grant

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:10%
as well as the next
two presidents,

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:10%
and the cabinet member Columbus
Delano, who was Franklin Delano

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.060 align:middle line:10%
Roosevelt's grandfather.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:10%
November 21, 1933,
President Franklin Roosevelt

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:10%
wrote "The real truth of the
matter is, as you and I know,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:10%
that a financial element
in the large centers

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:10%
has owned the government
ever since the days of Andrew

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Jackson."

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln's half-brother
worked for Lewis Cass Payseur

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.685 align:middle line:90%
in the Merovingian dynasty.

00:15:58.685 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Payseur owned
Jekyll Island, which

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
was where the Federal
Reserve Bank was created.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-1800s,
Lincoln and the Whigs

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:84%
were trying desperately
to keep Andrew Jackson

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
from establishing a
gold standard called

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:90%
the independent treasury system.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln and his party fought to
set up a central bank, making

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
such public speeches as "Under
a gold and silver standard,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
all will suffer more
or less, and very many

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
will lose everything that
renders life desirable."

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln's statement resounds
elements of scare tactics,

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:84%
as this entire
speech-- as well as

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
other speeches on the
matter-- gave no real evidence

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:84%
or explanation for the
concerns of the gold standard.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1900s,
after a failed attempt

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
for Woodrow Wilson
to set up what

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
was called the League of
Nations following World War I,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Wilson and his
advisor Colonel House

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:84%
set up the Institute of
International Affairs.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:10%
This Institute had two
branches, one set up in England,

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:10%
called the Royal Institute
of International Affairs,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:10%
and the Council on
Foreign Relations

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:10%
was incorporated as
the American branch.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
Founding members included
Colonel House, JP Morgan,

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
John D. Rockefeller, and
other tycoons at the time.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
A national income
tax was declared

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
unconstitutional in 1895
by the Supreme Court.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:84%
But a constitutional amendment
was proposed in Congress

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:90%
by Senator Nelson Aldrich.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
This makes much
more sense when you

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:84%
notice that Nelson
Aldrich was also

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:84%
known as being the authentic
voice of JP Morgan,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and later married into
the Rockefeller family.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:84%
27% to 35% percent of American
workers' pay is taxed,

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and this money goes to
the central bank, called

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve
Board, or the Fed.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who are unaware
of what the Federal Reserve

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Bank is and what
it is capable of,

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
it is a
non-government-owned bank

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.446 align:middle line:84%
that provides the US
with all of its currency.

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Yet one of the most amazing
aspects of the central bank

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:84%
is the suspension
of specie payments,

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:84%
in which the Fed can refuse
to pay their obligations.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Yet taxpayers must pay
their debts or go bankrupt.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.950 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
suspension of specie payments

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
is the central bank's
right to breach a contract

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:90%
with no penalty whatsoever.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:84%
In simpler terms,
it is called theft.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible that the Fed
is allowed to breach contracts

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
without penalty
from our government

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.500 align:middle line:84%
when they supply
all of our currency?

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:90%
The answer is simple.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve Bank has
power over the government

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:90%
instead of under it.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Those who have the most
influence over the Federal

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Reserve Bank now can wield
that influence over the United

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:84%
States government through
political lobbying

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.015 align:middle line:90%
and economic decisions.

00:18:49.015 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Carroll Quigley, Bill
Clinton's mentor while

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:10%
at Georgetown University,
wrote about central banks

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:10%
"They want nothing less
than to create a world

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:10%
system of financial
control in private hands,

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:10%
able to dominate the political
system of each country

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:10%
and the economy of the
world as a whole, controlled

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.810 align:middle line:10%
in a feudalist fashion by the
central banks of the world

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:10%
acting in concert by
secret agreements,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:10%
arrived at in frequent private
meetings and conferences."

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It is important to
know that nearly all

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
of the founders of the
Federal Reserve Bank

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:84%
were involved with the
conception of the Council

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:90%
on Foreign Relations.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Since 1934, we are now finding
that all Secretaries of War

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
or Defense since Henry L.
Stimson, almost every head

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
of CIA since Allen
Dulles, nearly

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
all presidential candidates--
Dwight D. Eisenhower, JFK,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Richard Nixon,
and Bill Clinton--

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:90%
were all members of the CSR.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
George Bush Sr. Was actually
CFR director from 1977 to 1979.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Understand that all of
these high-ranking positions

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
were lobbied into place
by the organization set up

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
by an international
banking cartel.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:84%
There are secret
meetings held by many

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.050 align:middle line:84%
of the same members in
the Trilateral Commission,

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
the Bilderberg Group, the Club
of Rome, the United Nations,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and the two branches of the
Institute of International

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Affairs.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
These groups make up what
is known as the roundtable,

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:90%
developed by Cecil Rhodes.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Other offshoots or
preliminary groups

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
are Bohemian Grove and
Yale University's Skull

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and Bones, which we all
know George Bush, Jr.,

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
George Bush, Sr., and John
Kerry were all a part of.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Most every meeting
by these groups

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:84%
are attended by the most
powerful government officials,

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:84%
corporate leaders, media
moguls, and royal families

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
These meetings are held in
secret, and not a word of them

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
reaches the mainstream media.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
How is it that so many powerful
people can attend meetings

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
alongside the mainstream
media and not a mention of it

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:90%
makes it to the public?

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
This all may start making much
more sense when you understand

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that common citizens
aren't meant to know

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:90%
what is happening at the top.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Is there any dispute that to
gain power in this day and age,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
it take strategy and
intelligence rather

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:90%
than brute force?

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Logic will tell you that
in any sport or game,

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:84%
to claim victory, you
must keep your moves

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:90%
strategic and secret.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.095 align:middle line:84%
Why would it be any
different in global politics?

00:21:19.095 --> 00:21:30.854 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.854 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>But, Adolf, that
would break our treaty.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.814 align:middle line:90%
You're a good guy.

00:21:35.814 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't go
back on your word.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.124 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.124 --> 00:21:43.092 align:middle line:90%
>>Are you kidding?

00:21:43.092 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.204 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:49.204 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>George W. Bush is
a direct descendant

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:90%
of Godfrey de Bouillon.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:84%
The Bouillons were servants
of Pope Gregory VII,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and led the European
noblemen into the crusade

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in order to recapture Jerusalem
from the Islamic faith.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
He became the first
king of Jerusalem,

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and duke of Lower
Lorraine, which

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:84%
was known as a major
region for the bloodline

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:90%
linked to the Illuminati.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Bush is closely related
to every European monarch.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
He's a 13th cousin of Queen
Elizabeth and Prince Charles.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
He also has kinship with every
member of the British Royal

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.467 align:middle line:90%
Family, the House of Windsor.

00:22:58.467 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
The House of Windsor
is known for abandoning

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
their German names
after World War I,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:90%
due to criticism of the people.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
A lesser-known fact about
the House of Windsor,

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.750 align:middle line:84%
however, is the heavy
funding contribution

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring Adolf Hitler to power
in the rise of World War II.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.399 align:middle line:10%
The swastika is actually
a symbol of the sun,

00:23:17.399 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:10%
referencing to the Sun
Order of the occult.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Heinrich Himmler was
the commander of the SS,

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and one of the most powerful
men in Nazi Germany.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Himmler was a seventh
ray occultist,

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.215 align:middle line:84%
and was very influenced by the
book "Ostara," by George Lunes,

00:23:32.215 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:90%
who was an Austrian mystic.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
This occult book mapped out plan
for a cleansing of ethnicities

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and bringing about one
race, and to revive

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
the ancient tradition of the
Knights Templar of the Middle

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Ages.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The Knights Templar were
a group largely killed off

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:90%
by the French monarchy.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
The remaining Templar
created many, Masonic orders

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and secret societies
throughout Europe,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.322 align:middle line:84%
from which the Illuminati is
believed to have originated.

00:23:56.322 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It's important to note as
well that the Bush family's

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:02.742 align:middle line:84%
ancestor Godfrey de Bouillon
was a holy Templar himself.

00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
To this day, every single
United States president,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
with no exception, has a
direct bloodline relationship

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:90%
to British monarchs.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And on December 20, 1993,
George Herbert Walker Bush

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:84%
was knighted by the
queen of England

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
as a Knight Grand
Cross of the Most

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Honorable Order of the Bath for
his leadership in the Gulf War.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Does it strike you as odd that
our president, our leader,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
kneeled before the
queen of England

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:84%
in a ceremony that
symbolizes allegiance?

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:90%
So what does this all mean?

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
It simply means that throughout
every major civilization,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
political power has remained
in a select few bloodlines.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is desperately held
in the same manner today.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:84%
It is openly admitted
to the public

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that major leaders worldwide are
part of secret fraternal orders

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
or secret meetings.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But what is not
disclosed to the public

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.060 align:middle line:84%
is the purpose of
these meetings.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So let me spell
this out for you.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:10%
The major leaders
from around the world

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:10%
are part of a united effort
to remain in power forever.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:10%
To do so, the people
are lured into the trap

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:10%
of perpetual debt, making
it impossible to be

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:10%
repaid by the people.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:10%
So in turn, all
property and assets

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.345 align:middle line:10%
will be repossessed
by the debtor.

00:25:16.345 --> 00:25:19.459 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.459 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
For those of you
who are unaware what

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.329 align:middle line:84%
it means when a government
owns everything of yours,

00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:25.245 align:middle line:90%
it's called socialism.

00:25:25.245 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:84%
All of this is part of an
ultimate goal of the mystery

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
religions.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The mystery religion
is the paganism

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking
about all along.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But the pagan religions
known to the public today

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:84%
are nowhere near as involved
as the mystery religion.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It is much less
confusing than you think.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Try to imagine this practice
as less of a religion

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.320 align:middle line:90%
and more of an ambition.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The ambition is to
reach enlightenment.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no superhuman
intelligence or fantasy

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:90%
involved in this.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:84%
The gifts of God
are very simple.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Omnipresence-- the power of
one being or consciousness

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.425 align:middle line:90%
to be everywhere at once.

00:26:07.425 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Omniscience-- the
power of knowing

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.325 align:middle line:90%
everything that can be known.

00:26:14.325 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And omnipotence-- to
have unlimited power.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.680 align:middle line:90%
We see all of this today.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be denied.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:37.566 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.566 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
If you still don't believe that
the mystery religion is present

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:90%
today, just look around you.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:10%
There are literally thousands
of statutes and emblems

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:10%
of ancient religions on every
political establishment.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Even on military uniforms, these
symbols are found everywhere.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:90%
But not only in our country.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:10%
The same emblems are
found on every nation's

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:10%
military uniform.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:10%
And why would this be?

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Because a life taken at
a chosen time, place,

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and a specific manner,
it becomes a sacrifice.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And to further illustrate
this point, on March 20, 2003,

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:84%
President Bush launched
the bombing of Baghdad

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:90%
at 5:50 Baghdad time.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:90%
This lasted until March 21.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It was called Shock and Awe
by the mainstream media.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But according to the
mystery religion,

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
this date is known
as the Eve of Ostara,

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:84%
more commonly known as the
spring, or vernal, equinox.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:10%
Occultists worship the
goddess of the Earth, Gaia,

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:10%
on this day.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.050 align:middle line:10%
The druids knew this date as
the spring fertility rite,

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:39.795 align:middle line:10%
the day of feast.

00:27:39.795 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:84%
The war was promptly
ended on May 1, 2003.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
The state is known in
the Druidic calendar

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Beltane, or Walpurgis Night.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
It was named after
Saint Walpurga, who was

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:90%
the pagan goddess of fertility.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:84%
From March 20 to May
1, the pagan ritual

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
is to give blood to the
earth and renew life

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:90%
to the goddess of fertility.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:10%
What better time frame
to declare a bloody war

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:10%
on the days where ritual
sacrifice, and end it exactly

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:10%
when the pagan rituals end.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:90%
The parallels are uncanny.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:84%
These are all facts written
in many different sources

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
around the world, and
are available to anyone

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:90%
to discover.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Connecting the
dots is up to you.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But make your own
decisions instead

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of settling for
conclusions that others

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.311 align:middle line:90%
have put in place for you.

00:28:31.311 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The right answers
are what you described

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.084 align:middle line:90%
are the right answers.

00:28:34.084 --> 00:28:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe everything I'm
telling you is wrong.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell
you what I think

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:84%
happens to be more
or less right,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:41.386 align:middle line:84%
but there isn't
any reason why you

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.462 align:middle line:90%
should pay any attention to me.

00:28:43.462 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Now you know why they're
out to destroy you.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.897 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.897 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Today, there is so much
confusion about what

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Christianity is, because
everything I thought was

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Christianity I found out wasn't.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:84%
If this continues, there will
be an overthrow of all things.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:10%
Yea, this change and overthrow
is deliberately planned.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.860 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing going on today
in the United States of America

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:90%
by accident.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing going
on in the Catholic Church

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.290 align:middle line:84%
today that's
happening by accident.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>They were acting
on an ancient hope

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:90%
that is meant to be fulfilled.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:84%
If you understand the
esoteric writing, what you do

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.081 align:middle line:84%
is you try to confuse
so the common people

00:29:45.081 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
like you will not
understand what is said.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.545 align:middle line:84%
So you take an
idea, and you put it

00:29:48.545 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning and
the end of the sentence,

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and you intersperse all sorts of
things in the middle to confuse

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:90%
common people like you.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And it all goes back
to these ancient times

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and tapping into the
mystery religions.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.770 align:middle line:84%
The occult is in total working
control of America today.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we're at
war in the Middle East.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:90%
What is it all about?

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the
continuing world revolution.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the move
to bring about World War

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.040 align:middle line:84%
III, and, ultimately,
then, the one world order

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and the new world religion.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>This information is backed
up by scholars, teachers,

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:84%
philosophers, doctors,
and professionals

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in every respected field
all around the world.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The reasons why the majority
of people don't know about this

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.890 align:middle line:84%
is because over
80% of population

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:84%
gets their world news strictly
from the mainstream media.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you trace every
major media station's chain

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:84%
of command to the top, you
will find the same people

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.630 align:middle line:84%
who own the
corporations that lobby

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
every high-ranking political
official in the place.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:55.838 align:middle line:84%
>>(SINGING) Is the
media obsolete?

00:30:55.838 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.596 align:middle line:90%
A media obsolete?

00:31:01.596 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:10%
Oh, media's controlled
by a few corporations.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:10%
Thanks, deregulation by the FCC.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:10%
>>You mean Disney, Fox
Westinghouse, and good old GE?

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>(SINGING) They own
networks from CBS to CNBC.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>They can use them to
say whatever they please,

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.104 align:middle line:84%

00:31:20.104 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:90%

>>They can give you lots of
cancer that can hurt your body.

bigshots don't care.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.895 align:middle line:84%
They're all sitting pretty
thanks to corporate welfare.

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.392 align:middle line:90%
>>What's that, now?

00:31:39.392 --> 00:31:42.016 align:middle line:84%
>>(SINGING) They get billions in
subsidies from the government.

00:31:42.016 --> 00:31:46.093 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to create jobs,
but that's not how it's spent.

00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:48.793 align:middle line:84%
They use tax and soft money
to support congressmen

00:31:48.793 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:84%
who will vote for weapons
programs again and again,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and let them dump toxic waste
where the young ones play.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.675 align:middle line:84%
>>And GE made the
bullets that shot JFK.

I challenge you to
do an internet search

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:90%
on the new world order.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.730 align:middle line:10%
You will be overwhelmed by the
amount of people trying to get

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:10%
the word out to the masses.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:84%
This exemplifies the findings
that 87% of the population

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:84%
formulates their belief
structure according

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:90%
to other people's ideas.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Only 13% formulate their
beliefs on logic and evaluation.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, the two
greatest factors

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that lead to the ignorance
of the public are as follows.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.775 align:middle line:90%

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>It is a term to
describe a group

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:37.420 align:middle line:84%
unwilling to look beyond the
overall consensus of the herd.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Many times, it is out of a
lack of drive or ambition

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.540 align:middle line:84%
to ask original questions to
arrive at genuine answers.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly
and dangerously,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
it is also an occurrence that
spawns from the fear of looking

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.900 align:middle line:90%
foolish in front of peers.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Go to another country.

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:54.920 align:middle line:90%
We don't want you here.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Both religion and politics
are forms of groupthink.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:10%
Words such as
patriotism and faith

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:10%
are both fancy words
that ultimately

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:10%
mean blind submission.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.670 align:middle line:10%
Supposedly, it is considered
heresy or unpatriotic

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:10%
to question the
words of your leader.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So the fear of upsetting
the superior higher power

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:84%
has forced the herd to
practice groupthink,

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.190 align:middle line:90%
regardless of what it leads to.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the greatest
examples of groupthink

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.830 align:middle line:84%
is the stigma given to
conspiracy theories.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The phrase conspiracy theory
gives a distinct impression

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.400 align:middle line:90%
to the average person.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.679 align:middle line:10%
The JFK assassination, Area 51,
Roswell, government cover-ups,

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:10%
strange disappearances,
these subjects

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:10%
probably sound a bit too
fantasy for the average person.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite understandable.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed
to sound made-up.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the mistranslation
of time and embellishment

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:84%
of these stories, facts
are added or omitted.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Some may be true, and
some may be false.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:55.699 align:middle line:90%
But one thing is for sure.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:10%
If a global secret
needed to remain hidden,

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.630 align:middle line:10%
yet began emerging
among the public,

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:10%
the best cover-up is to
embellish or alter the story

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.457 align:middle line:10%
until it sounds ludicrous.

00:35:05.457 --> 00:35:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when the
secret involves the government,

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and the government has intimate
ties to the mainstream media,

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and the mainstream
media, as said before,

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.200 align:middle line:84%
has been proven to sway at least
80% of the public's opinion?

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.380 align:middle line:90%
The logic is undeniable.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Media in every form
is put in place

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to make people feel stupid
for even keeping an open mind

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.040 align:middle line:90%
towards conspiracy theories.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Movies, books, fairy
tales, and folklore

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:84%
are all tools to make
the average person feel

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.730 align:middle line:84%
insane for supporting or
believing the conspiracy.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.240 align:middle line:10%
And why shouldn't they?

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Our leaders have no
problems telling us

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.190 align:middle line:84%
not to investigate or
believe in these theories.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Let us never tolerate
outrageous conspiracy theories

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.700 align:middle line:84%
concerning the attacks
of September the 11.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.194 align:middle line:84%
Malicious lies that attempt
to shift the blame away

00:35:51.194 --> 00:35:52.485 align:middle line:90%
from the terrorists themselves.

00:35:52.485 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>The most basic
of pagan practices

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.400 align:middle line:84%
is the control of
human population

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a perfect balance
between man and nature.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to bring the
population down to 500 million,

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.135 align:middle line:84%
which is over 90%
reduction in humanity.

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:14.242 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.242 --> 00:36:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've
abandoned everything

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that we've been trained to
think prior to this moment,

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.620 align:middle line:84%
we can start looking at
the world for what it is,

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.380 align:middle line:84%
instead of what
people tell us it is.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Open your eyes today
as if you've never

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:90%
seen the world before.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And we'll begin to notice
that the goal of population

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:84%
reduction is
everywhere around us.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:10%
>>Let me assure you that
absolutely nothing that I'm

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:47.200 align:middle line:10%
going to tell you is
exaggerated, is interpolated,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:10%
or is imagined.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.195 align:middle line:10%
Everything I'm going to
tell you is documented.

00:36:52.195 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:90%


00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:84%
He who controls food
controls the world.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, they said, in
1962, we are going

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to work toward total global
implementation of Codex

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Alimentarius on
December 31, 2009.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.540 align:middle line:90%
They were guidelines.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, Codex
Alimentarius Commission

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is administered by the World
Health Organization-- WHO--

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and the FAO-- the Food and
Agriculture Organization.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.545 align:middle line:84%
They fund Codex and they run
it at the request of the UN.

00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So they're mommy and daddy
to Codex Alimentarius.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, Codex, with no
notice here in this country

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, declared nutrients--
put on your intellectual seat

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:52.356 align:middle line:84%
belts-- declared
nutrients to be toxins.

00:37:52.356 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:90%
They're poisonous.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:10%
Under Codex, every
dairy cow on the planet

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:10%
must be treated with Monsanto's
recombinant bovine growth

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.100 align:middle line:10%
hormone.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:12.480 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, under
Codex, every animal

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:10%
used for food on the
planet must be treated

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.120 align:middle line:10%
with subclinical antibiotics.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And must be treated with
exogenous growth hormones.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:32.130 align:middle line:10%
If you do the numbers, in
the WHO FAO projections,

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.930 align:middle line:10%
epidemiological
projections, they

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:10%
estimate-- not I-- that
just the vitamin and mineral

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:44.870 align:middle line:10%
guideline alone, when it goes
into global implementation,

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:51.980 align:middle line:10%
will result in a minimum
of three billion--

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:56.980 align:middle line:10%
that's b, bad, big,
billion-- deaths.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:84%
One billion through
simple starvation.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Those folks who die are not
particularly economically

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:84%
successful, from the point
of view of the corporations.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But the next two
billion, they will

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:84%
die from the preventable
diseases of undernutrition.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Who will live?

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Probably those people
who are wealthy enough

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and powerful enough to have
their own pushers of clean food

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:90%
and nutrients.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:90%
So we need your help.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the United
States leadership

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:37.460 align:middle line:84%
is what's going
to literally save

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.940 align:middle line:90%
the population of the planet.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>The UN has put out
dozens of public documents

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
where they're calling for an
80% world population reduction.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at the Beijing
Women's Conference,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
the world conference
back in 1997,

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:84%
the head of UN
food program said,

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.350 align:middle line:84%
we will use food as a
weapon against the people.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>66% of the United States
residents' public water

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:12.620 align:middle line:90%
is fluoridated.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:84%
It is known to have tremendous
effects on bone cancer,

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.030 align:middle line:84%
joint problems, bone weakness,
lower estrogen and testosterone

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.340 align:middle line:84%
levels, and dental fluorosis,
which is yellowing of the teeth

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.990 align:middle line:90%
and pitting in the enamel.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it make more sense
to enhance public water

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.840 align:middle line:84%
with vitamins, which are meant
to be ingested to promote

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.010 align:middle line:84%
overall health, rather than
putting such a toxic chemical

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:84%
in our water with
a bogus explanation

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.815 align:middle line:84%
that it will improve
our dental health?

00:40:37.815 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.660 align:middle line:84%
We now know that fluoride
causes more dental problems

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:90%
than it solves.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Something doesn't
seem right about this.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you honestly believe
that these companies

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.360 align:middle line:84%
care deeply enough
for the people

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to spend large amounts
of their own money

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to fluoridate public water
when the people already

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:90%
purchase their own toothpaste?

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's a difference between
toothpaste and drinking water.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't ingest toothpaste.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.470 align:middle line:84%
If you go to any hardware store
and look at any rat poison

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:12.560 align:middle line:84%
product, you will only find one
ingredient-- sodium fluoride.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.380 align:middle line:84%
It is the most toxic
ionic molecule outside

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.570 align:middle line:90%
of potassium dichromate.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dannon, along
with other companies,

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
have begun fluoridating
bottled water.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It is becoming increasingly
difficult to get away from.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that fluoride is
also used in many prescription

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:84%
antidepressants shows that
it eliminates aggression

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and motivation in people.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Fluoride, to my
knowledge as a physician,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:84%
has absolutely no biological
benefit whatsoever.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>But one of the
significant things

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:46.530 align:middle line:84%
is the Russians carried out
all sorts of experiments

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:84%
on the people
living in the gulag.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.473 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, of course,
was to fluoridate the water.

00:41:50.473 --> 00:41:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.454 align:middle line:84%
You fluoridate the water, why,
people are not as aggressive

00:41:54.454 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:90%
as they ordinarily would be.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what is the
active ingredient

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in Prozac that is so widely
distributed in America today?

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a fluoride compound.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.410 align:middle line:10%
>>And now we are finding
that public water nationwide

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.500 align:middle line:10%
is showing up with
arsenic, lead, cadmium,

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.200 align:middle line:10%
and thermonium, which is a
radioactive form of lead.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Cancer, lowered sex drive,
birth defects, sedation,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and brain defects.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Does this not sound
like a wonder drug

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.820 align:middle line:84%
for anyone aiming to
control a population?

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:10%
>>It's quite astonishing,
Paul, the degree

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:10%
to which
environmentalists have not

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.400 align:middle line:10%
been educated about fluoride.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:84%
People have an unconscious
trust in their doctor

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:90%
or their dentist.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you can persuade doctors
and dentists that fluoride

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:84%
is safe and good, then
you're able to reach

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:49.770 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the nation.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:84%
People believe their
doctors and dentists.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was a way of
promoting fluoride for Bernays.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride was killing their
cattle, destroying their crops.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:10%
Fluoride given to
rats had produced

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.970 align:middle line:10%
bone cancer and liver cancer.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And that those results
had been doctored

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to make it look
as though fluoride

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.790 align:middle line:90%
hadn't caused as much cancer.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.530 align:middle line:10%
>>The pattern that
we saw, typically,

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.900 align:middle line:10%
is what we see with other
neurotoxic agents that are well

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:10%
known to cause a hypoactivity,
or a memory problem,

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.430 align:middle line:10%
or an IQ problem.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:29.280 align:middle line:84%
When I first presented the
results of these studies,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:34.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the individuals sitting
and listening to the results,

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.120 align:middle line:84%
he says, do you have any
idea what you're saying.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And he says you're
telling us that we're

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:90%
reducing the IQ of children.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:90%
And, basically, I said yes.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:44:17.910 align:middle line:90%


00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Aspartame.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.600 align:middle line:84%
The artificial sweetener
found in almost

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.460 align:middle line:84%
every low-sugar or sugar-free
product on the market.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>First of all,
aspartame is made up

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
of three things--
methanol, which,

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of course, is what produces
blindness, aspartic acid,

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.360 align:middle line:90%
and phenylanaline.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:90%
These are all poisons.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Aspartic acid, of course,
produces brain lesions.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.260 align:middle line:84%
This was known back
in the early 1970s.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Methanol produces blindness.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Phenylanaline is what you
see certainly in the brain,

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and in high dosages
produces trauma.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.265 align:middle line:90%
>>We're not making this all up.

00:44:52.265 --> 00:44:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The FDA did publish back
in, I think it was the '80s,

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:01.010 align:middle line:84%
they did publish the
92 potential side

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.140 align:middle line:90%
effects of aspartame.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And these side effects are
quite extremely serious.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Things like dizziness,
problems with balance,

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:15.180 align:middle line:84%
abdominal pain and
cramps, changes

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.580 align:middle line:84%
of vision, seizures
and convulsions,

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.210 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.147 align:middle line:84%
>>So the nervous system seems
to be one of the areas that's

00:45:23.147 --> 00:45:23.730 align:middle line:90%
most affected.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing people
have difficulty thinking.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.930 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're walking
around in a cloud or a fog.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Yet despite all of
these harmful effects,

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Donald Rumsfeld pushed it out
into the stores in over 5,000

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.240 align:middle line:84%
products when he was CEO
of Searle, a company that

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.275 align:middle line:90%
manufactured aspartame.

00:45:41.275 --> 00:45:55.730 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The sustainable goal
is the elimination

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.940 align:middle line:90%
of the middle class.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.062 align:middle line:84%
The world cannot support
6 billion people.

00:46:07.062 --> 00:46:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But you see, the plan behind
sustainable development

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:12.700 align:middle line:90%
includes population control.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a program for land use
control, education control,

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and population control.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.760 align:middle line:84%
The leaders of the
sustainable movement

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.690 align:middle line:84%
say that the world's human
population should not

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.610 align:middle line:90%
exceed 500 million people.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a 93% reduction of
today's population levels.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:84%
In 1992, while the Rio
conference was going on,

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.970 align:middle line:84%
George Bush, then
president was there.

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:41.125 align:middle line:84%
He was just off-shore on
Prince Charles's yacht,

00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:45.360 align:middle line:84%
where he executed the
Agenda 21 protocols

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the United
States, and brought it back

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.130 align:middle line:90%
to Washington, DC.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Within a year, Bill
Clinton, by executive order,

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.350 align:middle line:84%
established the
President's Council

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:59.710 align:middle line:90%
for Sustainable Development.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.820 align:middle line:10%
>>In 1996, Bill Clinton set
up the President's Council

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.410 align:middle line:10%
on Sustainable Development.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.180 align:middle line:10%
One of the dictates
of Agenda 21 is

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.095 align:middle line:10%
that every country
in the world is

00:47:11.095 --> 00:47:14.560 align:middle line:10%
to set up a national council
to oversee the implementation

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.930 align:middle line:10%
of Agenda 21.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:20.230 align:middle line:10%
I've listened to
Gorbachev explain,

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:24.740 align:middle line:10%
"We are writing a new set
of 10 or 15 commandments

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:10%
to replace the original 10."

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.495 align:middle line:84%
Which one of the 10 do you
think these guys don't like?

00:47:31.495 --> 00:47:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Thou shalt not lie?

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Thou shalt not steal?

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Thou shalt not covet?

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell you what--
these people have lied to us.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They're in the process of
stealing all of this nation's

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.370 align:middle line:90%
natural resources.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And they covet
everything you have left.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>To explain the
map, the red are

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.070 align:middle line:84%
areas that are to be
off-limits to human beings.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:04.130 align:middle line:10%
If you live there, you won't.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Yellow areas are the
areas for major control

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.720 align:middle line:90%
of all human activity.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.325 align:middle line:90%
If you lived there, you won't.

00:48:13.325 --> 00:48:15.980 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.370 align:middle line:84%
The black dots are the
smart growth cells.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:24.290 align:middle line:84%
That's where human beings
are to be stacked and packed

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:28.455 align:middle line:84%
in small living units
along rail tracks.

00:48:28.455 --> 00:48:30.570 align:middle line:84%
The smart growth
program ultimately

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:36.620 align:middle line:84%
has jobs assigned and children
cared for by the state.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:41.890 align:middle line:90%


00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>And in conjunction
with Codex Alimentarius,

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.850 align:middle line:84%
food will be limited,
and water consumption

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:50.820 align:middle line:84%
will be decreased to 10
gallons per day per person.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.390 align:middle line:84%
That is over a 90% reduction
in people's average daily water

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:55.510 align:middle line:90%
consumption.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.555 align:middle line:84%
And along with shortages
of food and water,

00:48:57.555 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:84%
the food we will
be provided with

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.370 align:middle line:84%
will be genetically manipulated
and nutrient-deficient.

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Genetic manipulation of
food causes complications

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.450 align:middle line:84%
in metabolizing and
utilizing food for energy.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.915 align:middle line:84%
>>In June of 2003,
scientists reported

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that the gene sequence of
the inserted genes into crops

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:18.750 align:middle line:84%
had actually
changed their order.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.170 align:middle line:90%
It had re-scrambled.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.464 align:middle line:10%
So the genetic inserts
are not stable.

00:49:22.464 --> 00:49:23.880 align:middle line:10%
Another laboratory
confirmed this,

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:10%
and found that it changed
in the same varieties

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:27.870 align:middle line:10%
in different ways
that they had tested.

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So not only is it
unstable and changing,

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.370 align:middle line:84%
it's not even uniform in
the way that it's changing.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.130 align:middle line:90%
This is incredibly dangerous.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Nutrient deficiencies due
to Codex's planned vitamin

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and mineral ban
will cause billions

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.030 align:middle line:90%
of preventable diseases.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Both of these will ultimately
lead to billions of deaths.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>The question is,
then, how do they do it?

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:10%
How in the world are
they getting this agenda

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:56.380 align:middle line:10%
from the international level
down to the local level?

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.136 align:middle line:10%
Well, they've got a
plan for that, too.

00:49:59.136 --> 00:50:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the environmental
side, there's

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.301 align:middle line:84%
probably a number
of different plans.

00:50:02.301 --> 00:50:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But from the
environmental side, you

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:84%
have an organization called the
IUCN-- the International Union

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:90%
for the Conservation of Nature.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Been in existence since the
United Nations was created.

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not part of
United Nations charter.

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:21.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a scientific adviser
to the United Nations.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:24.372 align:middle line:84%
But through the
IUCN, such programs

00:50:24.372 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as Ecosystem Management,
American Heritage Rivers,

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.770 align:middle line:84%
the Clean Water Initiative,
the Endangered Species

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Act, and all the rules and
regulations of the EPA-- US

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Fish and Wildlife Service, US
Forest Service, the US Park

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Service, and so forth.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.550 align:middle line:84%
They also discuss
property rights

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:41.740 align:middle line:90%
in this particular document.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:46.060 align:middle line:84%
They say that property
rights are not absolute.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.450 align:middle line:90%
They are not unchanging.

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:50.430 align:middle line:84%
They're not inalienable,
like our Constitution,

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and the Declaration
of Independence.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So they state, rather,
they are complex, dynamic,

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and shifting relationship
between two or more parties

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.950 align:middle line:90%
over space or time.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.600 align:middle line:84%
In a biocentric approach, says
the IUCN, the rights of nature

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.740 align:middle line:84%
are defended first and
foremost, on the grounds

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.550 align:middle line:84%
of the intrinsic value of
animals, plants, rivers,

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.830 align:middle line:84%
mountains, and
ecosystems, rather than

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:14.280 align:middle line:84%
simply on the basis of
the utilitarian value

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.620 align:middle line:90%
or benefit to human beings.

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
nature comes first.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Nature's needs comes
before man's needs.

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:28.270 align:middle line:84%
In a religious context, this is
called pantheism-- the belief

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.890 align:middle line:90%
that nature is God.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It goes on to say, even
worse, people are, then,

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:36.650 align:middle line:84%
members of a
community of beings,

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:84%
like human beings,
living and non-living.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So a rock is now elevated up
to the status of a human being.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're both equal in the
eyes of this belief system.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not hard to imagine that
if you believe that humans

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.170 align:middle line:84%
are the cause of all the
worst problems, that we're

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:57.920 align:middle line:90%
overpopulated.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.990 align:middle line:84%
They give two solutions-- and
only two-- to this problem.

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:07.390 align:middle line:84%
The first is that it's estimated
that an agricultural world

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.580 align:middle line:84%
in which most human
beings are peasants

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:13.080 align:middle line:84%
should be able to support
5 to 7 billion people.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, folks, we have 6
billion people right now.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.276 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of us in
this room, or nearly

00:52:18.276 --> 00:52:19.650 align:middle line:84%
all of us in this
room, are going

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.460 align:middle line:84%
to have to become
agrarian peasants if we

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.120 align:middle line:90%
use this solution.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.910 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, they go on to
say a reasonable estimate

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:29.000 align:middle line:84%
for an industrialized world
society at the present North

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.060 align:middle line:84%
American material
standard of living

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:90%
would be 1 billion people.

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.372 align:middle line:90%


00:52:36.372 --> 00:52:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So if we wanted to maintain
our current standard of living,

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.040 align:middle line:84%
we would have to reduce the
Earth's human population

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.520 align:middle line:90%
by somewhere around 70%.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.200 align:middle line:84%
In 1970, just three years
after the publication

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Iron Mountain
Report, which

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.230 align:middle line:84%
calls for, if we're going to
create a world government,

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.540 align:middle line:84%
we can no longer use
war as a mechanism

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to cause fear
amongst populations,

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, allow us
to control the behavior

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.080 align:middle line:90%
of populations through fear.

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And they settled on, in
1967, in their publication

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:11.960 align:middle line:84%
called the Iron Mountain Report,
the environmental Holocaust.

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.870 align:middle line:84%
In 1970, three years
after that publication,

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:middle line:84%
"Foreign Relations"
began to publish

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:21.890 align:middle line:84%
a series of articles describing
the ecological Holocaust that

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:23.570 align:middle line:90%
was facing the world.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
issue, the first issue

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.280 align:middle line:84%
done by George Kennan, to
prevent a world disaster where

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.390 align:middle line:84%
it was summed up in three
points that the eco crisis

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:37.880 align:middle line:84%
is a global threat so great,
that it endangers all of life

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.460 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>If you look at the 10
hottest years ever measured,

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.180 align:middle line:84%
they've all occurred
in the last 14 years.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:02.910 align:middle line:90%
And the hottest of all was 2005.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:05.530 align:middle line:90%
We are causing global warming.

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:10.580 align:middle line:84%
This is really not a political
issue so much as a moral issue.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Temperature increases are
taking place all over the world.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's causing
stronger storms.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we should
prepare against other threats

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:23.250 align:middle line:90%
besides terrorists?

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The Arctic is
experiencing faster melt.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.910 align:middle line:84%
If this were to go, sea level
worldwide would go up 20 feet.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.150 align:middle line:84%
This is what would
happen in Florida.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Around Shanghai, home
to 40 million people.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Around Calcutta,
60 million people.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's Manhattan.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:43.100 align:middle line:84%
The World Trade Center
memorial would be underwater.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Think of the impact of a couple
hundred thousand refugees.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.724 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine
a hundred million.

00:54:48.724 --> 00:54:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:56.589 align:middle line:10%
Those who deny global warming
are just flat-out wrong.

00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:58.130 align:middle line:10%
>>Ellen Goodman of
the "Boston Globe"

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:01.450 align:middle line:10%
wrote "Let's just say that
global warming deniers are now

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.380 align:middle line:10%
on par with Holocaust deniers."

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Scientists' silenced
for questioning

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.030 align:middle line:90%
the threat of global warming.

you must do so as an
independent citizen.

I'm aware of

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is that it's warmed
in the last century.

>>They completely
ignore the fact

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.750 align:middle line:10%
that there's this thing called

was signed by
19,000 professionals

>>I have to speak out
and say the science

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.510 align:middle line:90%
we have is still incomplete.

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And the science we're
being told by the IPCC

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.800 align:middle line:90%
is really an incorrect science.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Global warming, paradoxically,
causes not only more flooding,

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.330 align:middle line:90%
but also more drought.

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:19.840 align:middle line:10%
Big hurricanes, tornadoes,
fearsome diseases,

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.500 align:middle line:10%
polio, tuberculosis, West
Nile virus, avian flu,

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:10%
SARS, polar bears that
have actually drowned,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.460 align:middle line:10%
mosquitoes,
caterpillars, communism.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.350 align:middle line:90%
It's slavery.

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Global warming.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Global warming.

created the Club of Rome,

and is the inner inner
circle of global elitists,

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:43.215 align:middle line:84%
in 1991 stated that while
searching for a new enemy

00:56:43.215 --> 00:56:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to unite us, we came
up with the idea

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that pollution, the threat of
global warming and the like,

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.740 align:middle line:90%
would fit the bill.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.290 align:middle line:84%
All of these behaviors are
caused by human intervention.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The real enemy, then,
is humanity itself.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Put this to you
bluntly-- global warming

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.590 align:middle line:90%
is a complete fallacy.

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Al Gore received the Grammy
and the Nobel Peace Prize

00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:08.960 align:middle line:84%
for a film that is filled
with holes and mistruths.

>>Ice cores taken 2000
meters below the surface

>>We believe that in Greenland,
the medieval warm period was

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:23.330 align:middle line:84%
about 1 1/2 degrees warmer,
on average, than today.

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>And they also
show consistently

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.690 align:middle line:84%
warmer temperatures
thousands of years

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.050 align:middle line:84%
ago, before man-made
greenhouse gases existed.

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Approach our time, we can
see that in the period between

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:37.490 align:middle line:84%
4,000 years ago and back to
the period 2,000 years ago,

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:40.430 align:middle line:84%
which is actually the Roman
Age, the temperatures have been

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:44.150 align:middle line:84%
decreasing in Greenland
by 2 1/2 degrees.

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Al Gore is made out to be a
revolutionary figure attempting

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.931 align:middle line:84%
to save the planet,
which is quite true.

00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:52.180 align:middle line:84%
He just doesn't mention the
fact that saving the Earth

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.570 align:middle line:90%
doesn't involve you.

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.900 align:middle line:84%
According to his
agenda, it will result

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.310 align:middle line:84%
in massive land
repossession and extreme

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:01.250 align:middle line:84%
limitations on food and
water and fossil fuels

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.040 align:middle line:90%
for the public.

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And please note that Al Gore
is a sustainable developer.

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.670 align:middle line:84%
The global warming lie
is very popular today

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:12.000 align:middle line:84%
because it receives
major media coverage,

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and has an attractively- titled
goal of saving the planet.

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But how does this tie
in with Agenda 21?

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:23.840 align:middle line:84%
The result of the 1992 Earth
Summit Conference in Rio de

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Janeiro was the Kyoto Treaty.

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.890 align:middle line:84%
The Kyoto Treaty states that
every country must drastically

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:33.100 align:middle line:84%
reduce the use of fossil
fuels by mandate of the United

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Nations.

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And as of June 2007, 172 nations
and other government entities

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.310 align:middle line:90%
have ratified the treaty.

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:44.900 align:middle line:10%
And if you're
wondering how this ties

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.680 align:middle line:10%
into putting the Earth's
priority above human survival

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.740 align:middle line:10%
in accordance with
pagan beliefs,

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.960 align:middle line:10%
every country's deadline
for the implementation

00:58:51.960 --> 00:59:29.710 align:middle line:10%
of Agenda 21 and the
Kyoto Treaty is in 2012.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:32.680 align:middle line:10%
And if this wasn't enough,
when the Pentagon was damaged

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:36.410 align:middle line:10%
in 9/11, they set a goal to have
a completely new and improved

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:41.160 align:middle line:10%
Pentagon in December of 2012.

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So Codex Alimentarius
goes into effect

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:47.520 align:middle line:84%
at the end of 2009, which gives
it three years for the Codex

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.970 align:middle line:84%
regulations on food
to create billions

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:53.010 align:middle line:84%
of preventable
diseases and deaths.

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:54.800 align:middle line:84%
When citizens of
every nation are

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.220 align:middle line:84%
dying of starvation
and diseases,

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and fear for their lives
because of global warming

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and major
catastrophes, they will

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:03.290 align:middle line:84%
do what the public
has been proven

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.050 align:middle line:90%
to do in times of great peril.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.520 align:middle line:84%
They will beg for
their government

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.010 align:middle line:90%
to step in and do something.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>How are they going to get
you to join the new economy?

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say,
we have a solution.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.033 align:middle line:84%
You see, one of the
tricks of the Illuminati

01:00:17.033 --> 01:00:18.870 align:middle line:84%
is they create a
problem, and then they

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:21.570 align:middle line:84%
provide a solution
when you beg them to.

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>And, pray tell, what will
the United Nations suggest

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.720 align:middle line:90%
when there's a global problem?

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They will demand a
global government--

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
a new world order--
exactly as the Maya, Hopi,

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Kalu Yuga, and many other pagan
civilizations prophesized.

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
By 2012, the Kyoto Treaty,
Agenda, 21, Codex Alimentarius,

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and the new Pentagon will be
fully operational to enforce

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.030 align:middle line:90%
a new world order.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And the new world
religion is obvious.

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
We will all worship
the Earth, Gaia,

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:58.290 align:middle line:84%
the mother goddess we saved from
extinction from global warming.

01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We will be told that
to keep from repeating

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the mistakes that
we made in the past,

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:05.050 align:middle line:84%
we must hold the Earth in
higher regard than humans,

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
just as pagan
traditions require.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.170 align:middle line:90%
This is too obvious to ignore.

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
It is right in
front of our faces,

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and yet we still
refuse to see it.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you that by 2012,
there will be a World War III.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But it will not be
between nations.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:23.600 align:middle line:90%
It will be us and them.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.110 align:middle line:90%
They know this.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think the
UN is consistently

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
trying to disarm the
public and the nations?

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:33.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us to be
capable of fighting back.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.750 align:middle line:10%
The proof of this is
in the film released

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:38.440 align:middle line:10%
by the UN called
"Armed to the Teeth,"

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.240 align:middle line:10%
where it demonizes
gun ownership.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It is also shown in the Freedom
from War Policy put in place

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:48.820 align:middle line:90%
by JFK in 1961.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>President John Kennedy
went to the United Nations

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:52.640 align:middle line:90%
September 1961.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.455 align:middle line:84%
And he presented the United
States' program for general

01:01:55.455 --> 01:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and complete disarmament and a
peaceful world during a speech.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said this is the official
program of the United States

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.600 align:middle line:90%
of America.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a disarmament program.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It calls for the United States
to turn over its military

01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:12.180 align:middle line:90%
to the United Nations.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Let that sit for a second.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
It calls for the United States
to turn over its military

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.470 align:middle line:90%
to the United Nations.

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
The program ends by saying
progressive controlled

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
disarmament would
proceed to a point

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
where no state would
have the military power

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
to challenge the progressively
strengthened UN peace force.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
The UN would have
all military power.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>This policy outlines some
pretty scary scenarios when

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.930 align:middle line:90%
you understand what it reads.

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:43.310 align:middle line:10%
It calls for the disbanding
of all national armed forces

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:46.700 align:middle line:10%
and prohibition of their
re-establishment in any form

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.230 align:middle line:10%
whatsoever other
than those required

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:52.980 align:middle line:10%
to preserve internal order and
for contributions to a United

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.390 align:middle line:10%
Nations peace force.

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.250 align:middle line:10%
This clearly shows
that the UN is

01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:01.120 align:middle line:10%
calling for all military power
to be under their control.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.870 align:middle line:10%
Inspection and verification
must establish both

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:07.530 align:middle line:10%
that nations carry out scheduled
limitation or reductions,

01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:10.590 align:middle line:10%
and then they do not retain
armed forces and armaments

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.890 align:middle line:10%
in excess of those permitted
at any stage of the disarmament

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.480 align:middle line:10%
process.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.470 align:middle line:10%
Strategic delivery
vehicles will be reduced.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.130 align:middle line:10%
Arms and armed forces
will be reduced.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.890 align:middle line:10%
And all the while, UN
peacekeeping powers

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:26.680 align:middle line:10%
would be strengthened.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.620 align:middle line:10%
A UN peace observation
group would

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.150 align:middle line:10%
be available to investigate
any situation which

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:36.150 align:middle line:10%
might constitute a threat
to or a breach of the peace.

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Establishing of a permanent
international peace

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
force within the United
Nations and depending

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.500 align:middle line:84%
on the findings of an
experts commission,

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
a halt in the
production of chemical,

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
bacteriological, and
radiological weapons,

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and reduction of the existing
stocks or their conversion

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:53.180 align:middle line:90%
to peaceful uses.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Peaceful uses of
biological, chemical,

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and radiological weapons?

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you see how they are
perverting the word "peace"

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and making this policy
sound unilaterally good?

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
There is no other way to
read this publication.

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It clearly states that
all nations will hand over

01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:13.855 align:middle line:84%
their military forces to a
global United Nations military.

01:04:13.855 --> 01:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%


01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
The US population is
currently around 300 million.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.566 align:middle line:84%
The national debt is
currently around $10 trillion.

01:04:36.566 --> 01:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So the current
debt, when divvied

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
among the American people, comes
out to approximately $33,000,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and has been growing at a
national rate of $1.46 billion

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.440 align:middle line:90%
a day since 2006.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, with electronic banking,
wire transfers, and credit

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.660 align:middle line:84%
cards people have less physical
custody of their money.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
As of right now, the amount
of money in circulation

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
is not able to cover
the national debt.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
This was carefully planned since
the inception of the Federal

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Reserve Bank.

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And the next plan step by
the elite is already in play.

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
George Bush signed a bill
implementing the North American

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Union.

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>President Bush signed
a formal agreement

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
that will end the United
States as we know it.

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And he took the step
without approval

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:25.020 align:middle line:84%
from either the US Congress
or the people of the United

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.074 align:middle line:90%
States.

01:05:26.074 --> 01:05:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>I think one thing people
who are dollar-based need

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to focus on is the amero.

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:32.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing that
nobody's talking about.

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's going to have
a big impact on everybody's life

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.400 align:middle line:90%
in Canada, the US.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And Mexico.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The amero is the proposed new
currency for the North American

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
community, which is
being developed right

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
now between Canada,
the US, and Mexico

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to make a borderless
community much like the EU,

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and the dollar, Canadian
dollar, US dollar, Mexican peso

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:55.150 align:middle line:90%
replaced by the amero.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>You see, the domination
of government by business

01:05:57.690 --> 01:05:59.226 align:middle line:90%
is called fascism.

01:05:59.226 --> 01:06:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering
how many people

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.620 align:middle line:84%
know what NAFTA is, the North
American Free Trade Agreement.

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Because under Chapter 11
of the NAFTA agreement,

01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
NAFTA tribunals trump all
US law if it conflicts

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
with either A, World
Bank's International

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Center for Settlement
of Investment Disputes,

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
or B, UN Commission for
International Trade Law.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Now that sounds scary
enough, but when

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.370 align:middle line:84%
you understand what
that reads, it also

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:26.050 align:middle line:84%
gives the power to violate
the First and Second

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Amendment, which is saying
bye-bye to the Constitution.

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>This will weaken
national sovereignty

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and bankrupt the
dollar we use now.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.390 align:middle line:84%
After this happens, the
Fed will call in all debts.

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
When the debts cannot
be repaid by the people,

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.770 align:middle line:90%
assets will be seized.

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And by this, I mean
absolutely everything you own,

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.850 align:middle line:84%
including your property,
your home, your vehicle,

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:53.630 align:middle line:84%
your furniture, and the
clothes on your back.

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
This plan is
already in progress.

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And when it takes place,
you will literally

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
be owned by the
Federal Reserve Bank.

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
This is how Agenda 21
will be implemented.

01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
The seized land will be
given back to nature.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And the people will be placed

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:16.740 align:middle line:90%
So what are we to do?

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
There's an overabundance
of information out there

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
for anyone to see pertaining
to why the situation seems

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
so hopeless and
out of our control.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
But in all honesty, there's
even more information

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
out there about how
to protect ourselves.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The only problem we face
is that most people don't

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
know how to apply this
information to their own lives,

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and rarely anybody takes the
time to spell it out for us.

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
There are many great teachers
out there-- teachers who

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
have dedicated their lives
to protecting the people who

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.580 align:middle line:90%
need protecting the most.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
The teacher has the most
difficult role in our society,

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
because nobody likes
attaining true knowledge.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
True knowledge encompasses
all aspects of existence,

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.540 align:middle line:90%
good and bad.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Most others do not.

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Hearing true knowledge
upsets people

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
because it implies that
we were wrong at one

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:09.770 align:middle line:90%
point in our lives.

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And another character
flaw is our desire

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to apply absolute truths
to unstable foundations

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.130 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.529 align:middle line:84%
When we do so, we
build a structure

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that we hope will define
us best when we're reaching

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
the end of our life on Earth.

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:27.270 align:middle line:10%
So everything we think
we are, everything

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.689 align:middle line:10%
we tell others we
are, everything

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.700 align:middle line:10%
we based our life-changing
decisions off of,

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:34.720 align:middle line:10%
is all depending on
a foundation that

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.872 align:middle line:10%
could crumble at any moment.

01:08:36.872 --> 01:08:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And because we've been told
our entire lives that there

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
are certain guidelines
and mores we must follow

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
to be a decent
human being, we deny

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.399 align:middle line:84%
everything that
may pose a threat

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:48.920 align:middle line:90%
to our unstable foundation.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
This is why we
despise true teachers.

01:08:52.410 --> 01:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
We lump these teachers into the
same category as terrorists.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And the method for spotting
these teachers and terrorists

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
are just as flimsy and
ridiculous as the methods

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:02.775 align:middle line:90%
used to spot witches.

01:09:02.775 --> 01:09:05.840 align:middle line:90%

witch, may we burn her?

01:09:07.638 --> 01:09:08.138 align:middle line:90%
>>Burn her!

01:09:08.138 --> 01:09:10.994 align:middle line:90%
Burn her!

01:09:10.994 --> 01:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%

she is a witch?

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.540 align:middle line:90%

01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm not a witch.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.779 align:middle line:90%

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.279 align:middle line:90%
>>They dressed me up like this.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:26.600 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't my nose.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.906 align:middle line:90%
It's a false one.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.540 align:middle line:90%

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, we did do the nose.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>And the hat.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.070 align:middle line:90%
But she is a witch.

01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:41.190 align:middle line:90%


01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

The kings never had the

Kings exist at the whim

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
is the priesthood standing
behind the throne.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It is a method of
encoding information

through a system of
mathematics and numbers.

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It is some of the

There's a method
to their madness.

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
There's really not
much method to yours,

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.785 align:middle line:84%
because you're operating
from a place of ignorance.

01:11:10.785 --> 01:11:12.283 align:middle line:84%
And until you
change that, you're

01:11:12.283 --> 01:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
going to be bumbling around,
bumping into each other,

the wrong things,

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:18.174 align:middle line:84%
not understanding the
nature of your enemy.

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't understand
the nature of your enemy

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and the weapons they use,
you cannot fight that enemy.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.160 align:middle line:90%
You can't fight the battle.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%

Supposedly, a CNN reporter
found Osama bin Laden,

took a television
camera crew with him,

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:44.330 align:middle line:10%
went in to Osama
bin Laden's hideout,

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:49.000 align:middle line:10%
interviewed him and
his top leadership.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And he came out and told
everybody within three weeks,

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Osama bin Laden is
going to do attack

and years, and can't find him.

01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Some doofus jerk-off
reporter with a camera crew

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
waltzes right into his
hideout and interviews him.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, be
prepared for a major attack.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.470 align:middle line:90%
But it won't be Osama bin Laden.

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It will be those behind
the new world order.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what Osama bin Laden's
targets are supposed to be?

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And if this doesn't materialize
next two or three weeks,

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:53.510 align:middle line:84%
it will eventually materialize,
because they haven't succeeded

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.540 align:middle line:10%
Don't march the streets claiming
that you are the Enlightened

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.210 align:middle line:10%
One because you've
read a book or saw

01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:44.180 align:middle line:10%
a film that gave you a glimpse
into an uncommon knowledge.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Don't scream phrases
into a megaphone

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that you borrowed from
another person's research.

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And don't proclaim yourself
an original thinker

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
because you belong
to a group that

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.870 align:middle line:90%
represents an unpopular belief.

01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Those are all examples
of the other side

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:03.040 align:middle line:84%
of the coin of groupthink,
leading a false rebellion.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.680 align:middle line:10%
False rebellion is dangerous
because it gives the illusion

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.350 align:middle line:10%
that you are free and
thinking for yourself.

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:11.190 align:middle line:10%
A true rebellion,
a true revolution,

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:14.360 align:middle line:10%
begins when you quit
following and start leading.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And those who end
up following you

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
should be taught by you
to quit following you

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
and start leading.

01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
lead to successfully

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is by fully understanding
your rights as a human being

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.120 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We have very powerful
tools on our side

01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
called the Bill of Rights
and the Constitution.

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
These documents state that
no government can deprive us

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.270 align:middle line:90%
of our natural rights.

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.010 align:middle line:90%
So how is that happening?

01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:44.730 align:middle line:84%
You must understand that
the elite group controlling

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
our government, our educational
system, agriculture, and media

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are also in control of
our free enterprise.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Free enterprise is
our economic system,

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
or our means of production,
privately owned and operated

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.870 align:middle line:90%
for personal benefit.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Free enterprise cannot legally
be taxed unless it volunteers

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.660 align:middle line:90%
itself.

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.370 align:middle line:84%
The reason why income
tax seems inescapable

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
is because most every
job on the planet

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
requires you to sign
a number of documents

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
with fancy wording
stating that you

01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:17.920 align:middle line:84%
are agreeing to be a
representative of a corporation

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.350 align:middle line:90%
or entity.

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.750 align:middle line:10%
What all this means
is simply that when

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:24.230 align:middle line:10%
you sign working papers,
which are required

01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:27.020 align:middle line:10%
by pretty much every
employer that you applied to,

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.200 align:middle line:10%
you are waiving your right
as a natural person protected

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.380 align:middle line:10%
under the Constitution,
and agreeing

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:35.630 align:middle line:10%
to represent an artificial
person that is not protected

01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:37.390 align:middle line:10%
under the Constitution.

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to avoid,
because if you do not

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:43.630 align:middle line:84%
sign the document waiving your
rights, you won't get the job.

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So why does every
employer voluntarily

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
pay taxes which leads to the
requirement of those documents?

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Because without doing
so, the business

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.090 align:middle line:84%
loses all state and
federal benefits

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:57.560 align:middle line:84%
provided to private or
commercial business.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
those people simply

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.850 align:middle line:84%
accept the mistruth that
income tax is required by law

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:05.160 align:middle line:90%
without investigating it.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.390 align:middle line:10%
When your name is
presented on the document

01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:08.990 align:middle line:10%
with the first
letter of your first

01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:11.740 align:middle line:10%
and last name
capitalized, it represents

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.570 align:middle line:10%
capitalistic diminish
at minimum which

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:17.270 align:middle line:10%
occurs when a man's
family relations alone

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:21.310 align:middle line:10%
would change it's a
minimal loss of rights when

01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:24.140 align:middle line:10%
your last name appears in
capital letters it represents

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:28.090 align:middle line:10%
capitus diminutio media,
which occurs when a man loses

01:18:28.090 --> 01:18:31.880 align:middle line:10%
his rights of citizenship,
but not his rights to liberty.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.970 align:middle line:84%
This means you could be fined
and penalized, but not enslaved

01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:37.100 align:middle line:90%
or imprisoned.

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But when your entire name is
capitalized on any document,

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
it represents capitus
diminutio maxima,

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.140 align:middle line:84%
which states that a
man's condition changes

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.320 align:middle line:90%
from freedom to bondage.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
All rights of citizenship and
family rights are surrendered.

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
This means you can be fined,
imprisoned, and enslaved

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
in any amount for any duration
at the whim of the state's

01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:01.720 align:middle line:90%
suggestion.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.240 align:middle line:84%
But it is important to note
that if you do not legally

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
bind yourself to these
documents stating that you

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.625 align:middle line:84%
waive your rights and
represent a corporation,

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
you do not have to
attend any court.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:15.850 align:middle line:90%


01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>There are two kinds of law
on the Earth, as I've said.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
One is called civil law,
which is the law of the land,

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and what is called
maritime admiralty, which

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.660 align:middle line:90%
is called the law of water.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:32.440 align:middle line:84%
The maritime admiralty
is banking law.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.855 align:middle line:84%
So consequently, the
corporation and government

01:19:34.855 --> 01:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and people who want
to control you,

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:40.090 align:middle line:84%
they create a second
you, and that second you

01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that they control,
that they created,

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:46.140 align:middle line:90%
is all capital letters.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.782 align:middle line:84%
Any time you get a bill, you
get a lawsuit, you get a fine,

01:19:50.782 --> 01:19:52.240 align:middle line:84%
a ticket, somebody
sends you a bill

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
from the Department of Water
and Power, check it out.

01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:56.900 align:middle line:90%
On your driver's license.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.100 align:middle line:90%
On your social security card.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:00.980 align:middle line:90%
On your insurance cards.

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:05.690 align:middle line:10%
Your name will always be
in all capital letters,

01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:09.060 align:middle line:10%
because only all capital
letters can be dealt

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.820 align:middle line:10%
with by banks and government.

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
You need to wake up and find
out how this stuff really works.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
understand that you

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
don't need to submit
yourself as an American

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:27.589 align:middle line:84%
to a British commercial
venture call courts.

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:28.380 align:middle line:90%
You're an American.

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:31.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to go to court.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
You only go to court because
you agreed to go to court.

01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:38.815 align:middle line:84%
When they send you a subpoena
to court or summons to court,

01:20:38.815 --> 01:20:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and they've sent you
something, you look at it

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, Jack,
that's not me.

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.890 align:middle line:90%
That's in all capital letters.

01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
All capital letters
is a corporation.

01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:52.660 align:middle line:10%
>>Those who are charged under
these maritime admiralty courts

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:55.020 align:middle line:10%
usually don't understand
that they're voluntarily

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.940 align:middle line:10%
being fined and imprisoned.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
When a judge calls your name
and asks if you are that name,

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
those who say yes
are verbally agreeing

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to represent the
artificial person

01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:08.890 align:middle line:90%
that the name represents.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
In doing so, you are
voluntarily waiving your rights

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:14.520 align:middle line:90%
under the Constitution.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Your absolute rights
as natural persons

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
are the right to life,
security, and property.

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
are very important.

01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Remember that you
can never be deprived

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.607 align:middle line:84%
of these simple rights, unless
you are willingly waiving them.

01:21:28.607 --> 01:21:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But you need to understand
your rights if you want

01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:33.160 align:middle line:90%
to be protected under them.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
When sustainable
development is knocking down

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
your door for the
right to your property,

01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:38.990 align:middle line:84%
you need to understand
your inherent right

01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
to your property, which extends
from the visible surface

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.280 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the Earth.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But please note that these
steps are simply the beginning.

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
They merely treat the symptoms
instead of attacking the root.

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:54.910 align:middle line:84%
To understand fully how
to protect yourself,

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
you need to understand
your origin.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:08.060 align:middle line:90%


01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
The true history
of this planet has

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
been stifled from the top
down since the inception

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
of monotheism and
the ridicule as well

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
as the outlaw on specific
cultures of all pagan religions

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:20.690 align:middle line:90%
and practices.

01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:24.450 align:middle line:84%
A lie has been forced
upon all civilizations.

01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to wonder why powerful
empires were threatened enough

01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
by paganism to make the
practice of such religions

01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:32.660 align:middle line:90%
punishable by death.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:35.910 align:middle line:84%
This threat didn't end
during the Roman Empire.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at how the
founders of America,

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
by mandate of Great
Britain, wiped out

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Native American tribes
indiscriminately.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Great Britain has
been known to show

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
some of the most brutal
forms of genocide

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, India,
New Zealand, New

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Guinea, and many other locations
which pagan tribes still

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.730 align:middle line:90%
existed.

01:22:55.730 --> 01:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
East Timor suffered one of
the worst genocides in all

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
of history, and was fueled by
the United Nations and United

01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:05.590 align:middle line:84%
States funding during the
Carter Administration.

01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:07.880 align:middle line:10%
The last thing that
the elite power wants

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.010 align:middle line:10%
is a sovereign group
or tribe setting

01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:12.390 align:middle line:10%
a positive example for others.

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind that followers
of monotheistic religions

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
are not to blame, just as not
all members of Freemasonry,

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
intelligence agencies,
fraternal orders,

01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
or political organizations are
part of the esoteric agenda

01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:28.160 align:middle line:90%
that is being carried out.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is difficult
for most to comprehend,

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
but paganism is no more
dangerous than understanding

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.520 align:middle line:90%
surgical procedures.

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge can be very
useful when applied properly,

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
yet it can also have detrimental
effects if misused or abused.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Understand that most
all of these problems

01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
are not by mistake,
but by design.

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Most common people
do not understand

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that colors, shapes,
catch words or phrases,

01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and biological cycles
are all used as talismans

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to affect humanity on a
psychological and emotional

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
level, at the level
of consciousness.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Colors are used hypnotically
in every news channel

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and corporate advertisement.

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Fast food chains typically
use vibrant reds, yellows,

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and whites in the restaurants
to cause the customers

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.230 align:middle line:90%
to feel hurried and restless.

01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:22.480 align:middle line:84%
This, in turn, causes customers
to filter in and out quicker

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.150 align:middle line:90%
to make way for more customers.

01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Simple business.

01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:29.940 align:middle line:84%
However, fine dining
restaurants make their money

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.850 align:middle line:90%
on a peaceful experience.

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So they use very
earthy, natural colors

01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
such as soft greens, blues, and
browns to calm to the senses

01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and make for a lengthy
and peaceful meal.

01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:43.390 align:middle line:84%
The same goes for
the music that is

01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:45.660 align:middle line:90%
played at these establishments.

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Specific musical
notations and progressions

01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
can give relaxing or
exciting stimuli to the body

01:24:51.190 --> 01:24:53.590 align:middle line:90%
without our knowledge.

01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The music industry
goes even further,

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and uses natural
rhythms of the heart

01:24:57.690 --> 01:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
to map out the
tempo of pop songs.

01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But music is not a
product of our culture.

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
In 1986, the National
Academy of Science

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
found that infants
prefer consonant sounds

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%
such as perfect fifths,
rather than dissonant ones.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
This is just a small example
of how our natural ability

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
to understand the math
of music comes innately.

01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So be mindful when placing
a child in front of a TV

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.410 align:middle line:90%
or near a stereo.

01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Those who believe that children
cannot comprehend violence

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
on the TV screen or aggression
from music are thinking

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.186 align:middle line:90%
strictly with the left brain.

01:25:33.186 --> 01:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
The child may not rationally
understand the words or actions

01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
on the screen, but the right
brain, even in infants,

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
can absolutely
understand everything

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in its immediate
environment, because it

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
transmits a frequency
that can affect

01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:47.980 align:middle line:90%
this on a subatomic level.

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Science has even proven
that proper sonic vibrations

01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:53.600 align:middle line:84%
are essential for the
health of vegetation.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Studies done on
many ecosystems have

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
shown that when a
species becomes extinct,

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
another species will come in and
replace the song pattern to fit

01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
the overall harmony of
the vibrations required

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:07.380 align:middle line:90%
for that plant life to thrive.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.350 align:middle line:84%
All of these are
known as talismans,

01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and are used very carefully
by corporations and media.

01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Catch phrases are also used
to spark certain emotions

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.060 align:middle line:90%
in the psyche.

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
When an average person
hears the words terror,

01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:25.400 align:middle line:84%
bombing, guns, murder,
the body and mind

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
respond with heightened
alertness and caution.

01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And when events such
as assassinations

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
of major leaders,
bombings, terrorism, or war

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
happen on large scales
throughout the world,

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.860 align:middle line:84%
the body responds differently
at different times.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.350 align:middle line:10%
The tragic events involving
the Branch Davidians

01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:46.020 align:middle line:10%
at Waco and the
Oklahoma City bombing

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.160 align:middle line:10%
claimed the lives of
men, women, and children

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.520 align:middle line:10%
as they ended in
flames on April 19.

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a pagan holiday
where human sacrifice

01:26:55.150 --> 01:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%
is made by fire.

01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:01.270 align:middle line:10%
The tragic events of
September 11, 2001,

01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:04.640 align:middle line:10%
happened on the Mayan calendar
date of 6 Emochs, which

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.450 align:middle line:10%
represents large-scale change.

01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:12.470 align:middle line:10%
And then, when the US attacked
Afghanistan on October 7, 2001,

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:16.640 align:middle line:10%
in retaliation, this was the
Mayan calendar date of 6 K,

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.850 align:middle line:10%
which represents balancing.

01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:24.600 align:middle line:10%
Two pagan holidays identical to
two large-scale media events.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.310 align:middle line:10%
Were the people supposed to see
the best show of their lives

01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:29.060 align:middle line:10%
all over the media?

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.980 align:middle line:10%
Who knows what the amazing
media coverage of these events

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.180 align:middle line:10%
did to the collective psyche.

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:37.600 align:middle line:84%
These large events
are not by chance.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.570 align:middle line:84%
One needs only to
look at the result

01:27:39.570 --> 01:27:42.310 align:middle line:84%
of the major political
decisions of the United States

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
since the inception
of the United Nations

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to catch a glimpse
of the ultimate goal.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.010 align:middle line:10%
Every major war, assassination,
terrorist attack,

01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:56.150 align:middle line:10%
or security weakness exposed
has two specific common themes.

01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:58.740 align:middle line:10%
The unfortunate event
makes worldwide news

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.350 align:middle line:10%
and scares or angers the public.

01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:04.590 align:middle line:10%
And the result, no
matter what, is always

01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:06.770 align:middle line:10%
the expansion of government
and the destruction

01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:09.390 align:middle line:10%
of constitutional freedoms.

01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:12.800 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter what the
excuse or explanation is.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
The result always
tells the truth.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.450 align:middle line:84%
A child can give
the greatest excuse

01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
every time he is
too sick for school,

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.160 align:middle line:84%
but if it always happens
on the day of a test,

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
the truth is revealed
by the result.

01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, the
major media outlets

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.820 align:middle line:84%
can give every
explanation in the book

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
as to why war is declared,
assassinations happen,

01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:34.820 align:middle line:90%
and terrorist events take place.

01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But if they all end up in
the expansion of government

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction of
constitutional freedoms

01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
for the people, the truth
is revealed by the result.

01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And because the vast
majority of the public

01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
are completely ignorant of
the natural biological cycles

01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:52.310 align:middle line:84%
within us, it is increasingly
difficult for them

01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to accept that these events
are by no means an accident.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.072 align:middle line:90%

We are not fixing to hit you.

01:29:46.876 --> 01:29:48.850 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

>>You've got my word.

01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It's solid.

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.420 align:middle line:90%
It's 1000% absolute.

01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:54.919 align:middle line:90%

No, honey.

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.970 align:middle line:90%
No reason to come kill you.

CS gas against infants,

against old people with

01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:23.550 align:middle line:10%
there were 67-year-old
men in there.

And there were young

And I can just see those kids
barfing, vomiting, screaming.

Because you can't
possibly have a gas mask

to breach holes
into the building,

01:31:19.090 --> 01:31:23.620 align:middle line:84%
they set up a configuration

You want it to burn slow,
you close off the vents.

configuration in that building

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that was consistent to
a pot-bellied stove.

01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
This pyrotechnic
projectile was one

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.010 align:middle line:84%
of two found in the
rubble of Mount Carmel.

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.780 align:middle line:84%
It is a 40-millimeter
incendiary device

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.921 align:middle line:84%
that is fired from a
handheld grenade launcher.

01:32:00.921 --> 01:32:27.480 align:middle line:90%

at 9:00 this morning

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.301 align:middle line:84%

01:32:32.301 --> 01:32:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I just took a
look down the street

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.160 align:middle line:90%

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.690 align:middle line:10%
I see another bomb truck
going, so apparently they're

01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:39.620 align:middle line:10%
going to try to get out
that third bomb that's

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:40.370 align:middle line:10%
been talked about.

01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>I've been told by
the police department

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that just as soon as
those bombs are defused,

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.764 align:middle line:84%
they will permit the
medical teams to enter.

01:32:46.764 --> 01:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, we're also hearing from
some witnesses on the scene

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:52.350 align:middle line:84%
that they've overheard from
firefighters that were first

01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:54.780 align:middle line:84%
on the scene that there was
a possibility that there was

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
a secondary explosive
device besides the car bomb

01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:01.460 align:middle line:84%
device outside the building,
and that that device may have

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:03.305 align:middle line:90%
been placed near the nursery.

01:33:03.305 --> 01:33:11.207 align:middle line:90%


01:33:11.207 --> 01:33:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Also, we're getting word
now that President Clinton is

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%

on, and what other danger may
be out there in Oklahoma City.

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.600 align:middle line:84%
That's something we need to
think about, unfortunately,

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.570 align:middle line:84%
this time, because
as we've told you,

01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:29.830 align:middle line:84%
two other explosive devices were
found that were not detonated.

01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:32.197 align:middle line:84%
And they were larger
than the first.

01:33:32.197 --> 01:33:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Right now, they
are saying that this

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is the work of a
sophisticated group.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
sophisticated device.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And it has to have been done
by an explosives expert.

01:33:42.060 --> 01:34:25.790 align:middle line:90%


01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Talk to any police official
anywhere, and pretty soon he'll

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.700 align:middle line:90%
bring up the shoot-out.

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:34.240 align:middle line:90%
February, 1997.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Two bank robbers in full
body armor and firing AK-47s

01:34:39.130 --> 01:34:41.140 align:middle line:84%
did battle with
police on the streets

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.340 align:middle line:90%
of North Hollywood, California.

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It was every officer's
worst nightmare come true.

01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Cops outgunned by the bad guys.

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.620 align:middle line:84%
After the LA shootout, requests
for surplus machine guns

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.590 align:middle line:90%
increased dramatically.

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:57.910 align:middle line:84%
The Los Angeles Police
Department alone

01:34:57.910 --> 01:35:01.490 align:middle line:90%
got 600 M-16s from surplus.

01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Nationwide, the number
given away more than doubled

01:35:04.330 --> 01:35:05.420 align:middle line:90%
this year.

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And many departments decided
to issue them to regular patrol

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:10.790 align:middle line:90%
officers on daily duty.

01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:15.620 align:middle line:84%
All because of one
shoot-out in one city.

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>That you understand I'm not
here representing the NRA.

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:20.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even a member, OK?

01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:24.460 align:middle line:10%
Secondly, I'd like to say that
in your opening statements,

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:28.160 align:middle line:10%
you commented specifically
on my testimony,

01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.170 align:middle line:10%
saying that it basically it had
nothing to do with this issue.

01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:32.740 align:middle line:10%
And I had to chuckle,
because then I

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.610 align:middle line:10%
noticed you had
Mr. Brady up here,

01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:37.010 align:middle line:10%
who was hit not with
an assault weapon,

01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.250 align:middle line:10%
but with a 22 caliber revolver.

01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:41.580 align:middle line:10%
So getting beyond
that, a couple of years

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:45.490 align:middle line:10%
ago, my parents and I went
to a cafeteria in Texas

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:46.490 align:middle line:10%
on a bright sunny day.

01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We weren't in a dark alley
where we weren't supposed to be.

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you all know
the story, this madman

01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:55.260 align:middle line:84%
drove his truck
through the window.

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:56.604 align:middle line:90%
And he began shooting.

01:35:56.604 --> 01:35:58.895 align:middle line:84%
Well, immediately my father
and I got down on the floor

01:35:58.895 --> 01:36:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and put the table
up front of us.

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And this guy kept shooting.

01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking,
what could it be?

01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Is it a robbery?

01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:09.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing that
generally comes to mind.

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.920 align:middle line:90%
And he keeps shooting.

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:16.792 align:middle line:84%
It took me a good 45 seconds to
realize this man wasn't there

01:36:16.792 --> 01:36:17.625 align:middle line:90%
to commit a robbery.

01:36:17.625 --> 01:36:20.650 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't there for a hit.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:22.830 align:middle line:84%
He was simply there to
shoot as many people

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:25.570 align:middle line:90%
as he possibly could.

01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:31.156 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that I'm not
mad at the guy that did this.

01:36:31.156 --> 01:36:36.760 align:middle line:10%
As he continued, it was
obvious he was a madman.

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:39.614 align:middle line:10%
My father, at that point,
said, I've got to do something.

01:36:39.614 --> 01:36:40.655 align:middle line:10%
I've got to do something.

01:36:40.655 --> 01:36:41.620 align:middle line:10%
He's going to kill
everybody in here.

01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:42.820 align:middle line:90%
And he rushed the man.

01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.274 align:middle line:90%
No way.

01:36:44.274 --> 01:36:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Guy turned, shot
him in the chest.

01:36:45.690 --> 01:36:47.170 align:middle line:90%
He went down.

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Was obviously mortally wounded.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.540 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason, that
made the man change directions

01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:56.196 align:middle line:90%
and go off to my left.

01:36:56.196 --> 01:36:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Shortly thereafter, someone
at the back of the restaurant

01:36:58.570 --> 01:37:00.410 align:middle line:90%
broke out a window.

01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:03.070 align:middle line:84%
When I saw what looked like
an opportunity to escape,

01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I turned around, and I grabbed
my mother by the shirt,

01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:06.160 align:middle line:90%
and I said, come on, come on.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:06.701 align:middle line:90%
We've to run.

01:37:06.701 --> 01:37:08.340 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get out of here.

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And then my feet grew wings,
and I was out the back window.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.100 align:middle line:90%


01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:16.550 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got out, I
realized that my mother had not

01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:18.480 align:middle line:90%
followed me out.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:20.290 align:middle line:10%
And as I learned from
the police officers,

01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:25.060 align:middle line:10%
she had crawled over to where
my father was, and cradled him

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:28.650 align:middle line:10%
until the guy got back around
to her, put the gun to her head.

01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:30.580 align:middle line:10%
She looked up at him,
put her head down,

01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.370 align:middle line:10%
and he pulled the trigger.

01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:35.107 align:middle line:10%
My parents had just had their
47th wedding anniversary.

01:37:35.107 --> 01:37:36.190 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't going anywhere.

01:37:36.190 --> 01:37:39.340 align:middle line:90%


01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, I'm not really
mad at the guy that did this.

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm certainly not mad
at the guns that did this.

01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:46.410 align:middle line:84%
They didn't walk in
there by themselves

01:37:46.410 --> 01:37:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and pull their own triggers.

01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:50.080 align:middle line:84%
The guy that did
it was a lunatic.

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.940 align:middle line:84%
That's like being
mad at a rabid dog.

01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:55.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm mad at my legislators
for legislating me out

01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:59.000 align:middle line:10%
of a right to protect
myself and my family.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.610 align:middle line:10%
I would much rather
be sitting in jail

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:02.650 align:middle line:10%
with a felony
offense on my head,

01:38:02.650 --> 01:38:06.000 align:middle line:10%
and have my parents alive.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.250 align:middle line:10%
As far as these so-called
assault weapons,

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:14.880 align:middle line:10%
you say that they don't
have any defense use.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.560 align:middle line:10%
You tell that to the guy that
I saw on a videotape of the LA

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:23.500 align:middle line:10%

his rooftop protecting

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.030 align:middle line:10%
his property and his life
from an entire mob with one

01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:29.190 align:middle line:10%
of these so-called
assault weapons.

01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell me that he didn't have a
legitimate self-defense use.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Just one final statement.

No legitimate hunting purpose.

01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:36.790 align:middle line:84%
that revealed to him the shape
of the interior of an atom.

01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Scientists were shocked to
discover that the atom is

01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:44.310 align:middle line:90%
almost entirely empty space.

01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The question then became how
could this empty atom possibly

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.695 align:middle line:90%
make the solid world around us?

01:40:49.695 --> 01:40:54.550 align:middle line:90%


01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Our true consciousness
does not exist in our brains

01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:58.130 align:middle line:90%
or in our bodies.

01:40:58.130 --> 01:41:00.749 align:middle line:90%


01:41:00.749 --> 01:41:02.540 align:middle line:10%
But this illusion of
our individual bodies,

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:04.770 align:middle line:10%
along with the misinformation
of our true origins

01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:07.590 align:middle line:10%
has manifested the idea that
we all think independently

01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:09.140 align:middle line:10%
from one another.

01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:10.660 align:middle line:84%
With this
misunderstanding, it would

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.960 align:middle line:84%
impossible to scientifically
explain telepathy,

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:16.760 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance, spiritual
mediums, and other phenomena

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.530 align:middle line:84%
dealing with transferring
information between sources

01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:21.849 align:middle line:84%
without physical means
of communication.

01:41:21.849 --> 01:41:23.265 align:middle line:84%
But when you
understand that there

01:41:23.265 --> 01:41:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is a common spiritual
bond between all things

01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:28.280 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, and that we
are all part of one divine

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.720 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, no phenomena
is unexplainable.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.750 align:middle line:84%
This simple understanding
fills all the holes

01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:34.800 align:middle line:90%
in modern religions.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.610 align:middle line:84%
It explains reincarnation, deja
vu, predictions of the future,

01:41:38.610 --> 01:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and literally every event
occurrence or anomaly

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:43.040 align:middle line:90%
ever experienced.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.650 align:middle line:84%
The blank matter within the
most basic building blocks

01:41:45.650 --> 01:41:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of perceivable existence is
malleable and molded by intent.

01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:53.700 align:middle line:84%
This means that consciousness
shapes our reality.

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.730 align:middle line:84%
This seems difficult
to accept for most,

01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and it is quite understandable.

01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:59.720 align:middle line:84%
In modern times, we are
taught from an early age

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.320 align:middle line:84%
how to think rationally
and tangibly.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a very left-brain
method of education,

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and it has more harmful effects
than it's given credit for.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The left brain deals with
logic, details, facts, patterns,

01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:17.340 align:middle line:90%
practicality, science, and math.

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:21.200 align:middle line:84%
As the right brain deals with
feeling, intuition, symbols,

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:26.460 align:middle line:84%
images, risk-taking,
philosophy, and religion.

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.470 align:middle line:84%
With a deliberate push
for government-controlled

01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:30.800 align:middle line:84%
educational
curriculums, generation

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.370 align:middle line:84%
after generation
of the youth are

01:42:32.370 --> 01:42:34.860 align:middle line:84%
being taught to focus only
on the facts, figures,

01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.290 align:middle line:90%
and numbers.

01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Repetition is used to train
children subconsciously

01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to accept what they're learning.

01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Children aren't
rewarded for questioning

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:44.370 align:middle line:84%
the validity of the
information they receive.

01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:45.840 align:middle line:90%
They are ridiculed.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.720 align:middle line:84%
However, the
children who blindly

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.620 align:middle line:84%
accept the information
as true and merely

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.043 align:middle line:84%
regurgitate the
information on command when

01:42:52.043 --> 01:42:54.320 align:middle line:84%
it is time to take a
test, those children

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.960 align:middle line:84%
go on to become
the decision-makers

01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.690 align:middle line:84%
in our government, law,
medicine, business,

01:42:58.690 --> 01:43:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and every other occupation
with power and prestige.

01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
The most detrimental
effect of being pushed away

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.820 align:middle line:84%
from holistic thinking
with the full brain

01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:08.800 align:middle line:84%
into a strictly
left-brain thought

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:11.630 align:middle line:84%
is what is known as the
suppression of the feminine.

01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Every male and female have
both feminine and masculine

01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:15.310 align:middle line:90%
qualities.

01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with man or woman.

01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:20.900 align:middle line:84%
These are represented by
the left and right brain.

01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Yin and yang.

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Black and white.

01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Light and dark.

01:43:23.890 --> 01:43:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And most every other duality.

01:43:26.230 --> 01:43:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Both are vital to our
spiritual and physical health.

01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:32.860 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, the
female was the rightful heir

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:33.920 align:middle line:90%
to the throne.

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.820 align:middle line:84%
The make she chose to
marry became pharaoh.

01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
This depicted the
goddess tradition

01:43:38.630 --> 01:43:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that has been
destroyed to make way

01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:42.980 align:middle line:84%
for a patriarchal,
male-dominated society we

01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:46.240 align:middle line:84%
see enforced in every
major denomination.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.580 align:middle line:84%
In suppressing the
feminine of every society

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and pushing the people to
strictly left-brain thinking,

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.390 align:middle line:84%
the natural ability for humanity
to feel earthly, cosmic,

01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and personal energy became lost.

01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Traditions that were passed on
through shamans, witch doctors,

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.820 align:middle line:84%
magicians, psychics,
and seers of all kind

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:05.870 align:middle line:84%
became outlawed and ridiculed,
and given a stigma of something

01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:07.580 align:middle line:90%
out of a Hollywood movie.

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Every religion explains
that we are children of God

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and have godliness inside of us.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.320 align:middle line:84%
If you erase the
anthropomorphized god

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and understand that God is
nothing more than spiritual web

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that connects all things,
all religious scriptures

01:44:20.010 --> 01:44:21.910 align:middle line:90%
begin to make much more sense.

01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are merely vessels
to contain our spirit, to gather

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:27.460 align:middle line:90%
experience for the divine mind.

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how evolution
is possible.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It is scientifically proven
that all species are evolving

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.600 align:middle line:90%
into more complex beings.

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Innate knowledge or racial
memory within all species

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.640 align:middle line:84%
is the understanding of
newborns of all kinds

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.560 align:middle line:84%
automatically know
specific details and traits

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that the mother does
not have to teach them.

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, innate knowledge
helps every species naturally

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.010 align:middle line:84%
evolve towards a more
complex organisms.

01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Lyle Watson claims that it
was a Japanese scientist who

01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:58.270 align:middle line:84%
observed the hundredth
monkey effect in 1952.

01:44:58.270 --> 01:45:00.020 align:middle line:84%
In this observation,
he discovered

01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that a certain portion
or percentage of monkeys

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.800 align:middle line:84%
learned or developed
a new trait,

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.480 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge became an innate
ability in that species.

01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:09.950 align:middle line:84%
This is further testimony to
a collective consciousness

01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:10.600 align:middle line:90%
among species.

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:16.080 align:middle line:90%


01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything in existence
has a natural vibration

01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:20.380 align:middle line:84%
to it, from our
atoms all the way

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to the vastness of the universe.

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.510 align:middle line:84%
To show a simple connection
between the Earth

01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and our bodies, take a look
at our bodies' harmonic

01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:30.080 align:middle line:84%
focal points, better
known as our chakras.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Just as there are harmonic focal
points on the guitar string,

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.480 align:middle line:84%
there are locations
within our body

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.345 align:middle line:90%
where our vibrations culminate.

01:45:36.345 --> 01:45:38.890 align:middle line:84%
In Eastern philosophies,
these seven chakras

01:45:38.890 --> 01:45:40.615 align:middle line:84%
are used to bring
health and balance

01:45:40.615 --> 01:45:43.250 align:middle line:84%
to the physical
and spiritual body.

01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth also has
seven chakra points

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.450 align:middle line:84%
at equally distant
locations from one another.

01:45:48.450 --> 01:45:51.460 align:middle line:84%
There's one chakra
point on each continent.

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The root chakra is in
Mount Shasta, California.

01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The sexual chakra is in the
Isle of Sun, Lake Titicaca,

01:45:58.190 --> 01:46:00.040 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.090 align:middle line:84%
The solar plexus chakra is
Uluru Kata Tjuta in Australia.

01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:06.565 align:middle line:84%
The heart chakra
is in Glastonbury

01:46:06.565 --> 01:46:10.120 align:middle line:90%
or Shaftesbury, England.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:13.140 align:middle line:84%
The throat chakra is where the
Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:13.892 align:middle line:90%
are.

01:46:13.892 --> 01:46:18.880 align:middle line:84%
The third eye chakra is in
Kuh-e-Malek Siah in Iran.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And the crown chakra is
at Mount Kailash in Tibet.

01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically, this
is explained because

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.190 align:middle line:84%
at the core of our Earth,
there is a molten iron crystal

01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that resonates at
approximately seven Hertz.

01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:33.270 align:middle line:84%
There are energy vortexes
all over the earth

01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:35.890 align:middle line:84%
where electromagnetic
energy emanates.

01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:38.130 align:middle line:10%
There are also several
vile vortices surrounding

01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:40.230 align:middle line:10%
the equator where
strange anomalies occur,

01:46:40.230 --> 01:46:42.490 align:middle line:10%
such as radio and
compass malfunctions,

01:46:42.490 --> 01:46:44.919 align:middle line:10%
as well as plane and
ship disappearances.

01:46:44.919 --> 01:46:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard
of a few of these.

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.280 align:middle line:90%


01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So the intangible parts of our
existence, such as emotions,

01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:56.580 align:middle line:84%
are part of the true reality
of higher consciousness.

01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.410 align:middle line:84%
If emotions are part of a realm
that we cannot experience with

01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:02.140 align:middle line:84%
our five senses, then how
is it that we are all aware

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:03.970 align:middle line:90%
of our emotions?

01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:05.750 align:middle line:84%
What most people
believe to be emotions

01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:07.510 align:middle line:84%
are not truly the
emotion itself.

01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:10.460 align:middle line:84%
What we are experiencing is
the physical manifestation

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.830 align:middle line:90%
of these emotions.

01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Anger causes disturbance in the
psyche, which manifests itself

01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:16.690 align:middle line:90%
in the ego.

01:47:16.690 --> 01:47:18.550 align:middle line:84%
These manifestations
cause the heart rate

01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:20.890 align:middle line:84%
to increase, body
temperature to rise,

01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and spawn many other physical
traits that signify anger.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Just as music from the radio
is a physical manifestation

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.240 align:middle line:84%
of an intangible signal,
our experience of emotion

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is the physical manifestation
of an intangible signal as well.

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.740 align:middle line:84%
It has been shown
that our emotions have

01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:39.980 align:middle line:90%
a vibratory frequency to them.

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, there
are only two emotions

01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that humankind
experiences-- fear and love.

01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:49.240 align:middle line:84%
All other emotions branch
either directly or indirectly

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:51.250 align:middle line:90%
from these two emotions.

01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Fear has a long and slow
frequency vibration to it,

01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:58.020 align:middle line:84%
while love has a very
rapid and high frequency.

01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:01.370 align:middle line:84%
To show the vibrations of the
very foundation of existence,

01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Hans Jenny developed what is
known cymatics in the 1940s

01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.720 align:middle line:84%
to show that when
vibrations of sound

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.730 align:middle line:84%
are passed through
a form of media,

01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:11.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a set
pattern that follow.

01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:13.250 align:middle line:84%
When the frequency
increases, the media

01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:15.700 align:middle line:84%
develops into a more
complex pattern.

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:19.630 align:middle line:90%


01:48:19.630 --> 01:48:21.700 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely what
is happening to our Earth

01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:23.520 align:middle line:90%
and to humanity.

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:26.930 align:middle line:84%
There are 64 possible codes
of amino acids in our DNA

01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:30.610 align:middle line:84%
structure made from four
elements-- carbon, oxygen,

01:48:30.610 --> 01:48:32.760 align:middle line:90%
hydrogen, and nitrogen.

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.900 align:middle line:84%
By any means of logic we
should have all 64 codes

01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:38.420 align:middle line:84%
activated within
our DNA structure.

01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Yet we presently only
have 20 active codes.

01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.970 align:middle line:10%
>>And of theses
64 possibilities,

01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:48.490 align:middle line:10%
it appears that only
20 of these codes

01:48:48.490 --> 01:48:51.720 align:middle line:10%
are turned on right now for
us-- the 20 amino acids.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:57.660 align:middle line:10%
There is a switch that turns off
and turns on where those coding

01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:59.330 align:middle line:10%
sites lie.

01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:03.910 align:middle line:10%
And that the switch for that
turning off and turning on

01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:05.760 align:middle line:10%
is what we call emotion.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.150 align:middle line:10%
This is the first
time that we've ever

01:49:08.150 --> 01:49:11.870 align:middle line:10%
seen the patterns of emotion
directly physically linked

01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:14.650 align:middle line:10%
to human genetic material.

01:49:14.650 --> 01:49:18.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, fear is a long,
slow wave of emotion.

01:49:18.490 --> 01:49:23.830 align:middle line:10%
So this wave of fear
is a long, slow wave,

01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:28.470 align:middle line:10%
and touches relatively
few sites on this DNA.

01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:30.980 align:middle line:10%
So an individual
living in fear is

01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:33.850 align:middle line:10%
limited to the number
of antenna that they

01:49:33.850 --> 01:49:37.370 align:middle line:10%
have available to them.

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Whereas an individual living
in the pattern of love--

01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:43.500 align:middle line:90%
this is love in DNA.

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:48.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see it's a higher
frequency, shorter wavelength.

01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:53.020 align:middle line:84%
We have many more potential
sites for coding along

01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.650 align:middle line:90%
that genetic pattern.

01:49:54.650 --> 01:49:56.316 align:middle line:84%
This information--
this is amazing.

01:49:56.316 --> 01:49:57.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time we've ever

01:49:57.690 --> 01:50:03.430 align:middle line:84%
had a hard digital link
between emotion and genetics.

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>This is important
to understand,

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:08.330 align:middle line:84%
because another researcher
named Vladimir Popenov measured

01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:12.370 align:middle line:84%
tiny particles of light called
photons inside a vacuum tube.

01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:15.170 align:middle line:10%
The photons were
scattered as expected.

01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:18.050 align:middle line:84%
A sample of DNA was then
entered into the vacuum tube,

01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:20.307 align:middle line:84%
and they measured
the photons again.

01:50:20.307 --> 01:50:21.890 align:middle line:84%
They found that the
particles of light

01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:25.250 align:middle line:84%
aligned themselves along
the axis of the DNA.

01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Then, as they removed
the DNA sample,

01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:30.750 align:middle line:84%
the photons remained aligned
to the same form of the DNA,

01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:33.160 align:middle line:90%
even though no DNA was present.

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what is known as
the phantom DNA experiment.

01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Science has now bridged
a very important gap

01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:41.650 align:middle line:84%
between physical and
ethereal or spiritual.

01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Our emotions directly
affect the structure

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.780 align:middle line:84%
of our DNA, which directly
shapes the physical world we

01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:48.850 align:middle line:90%
experience every day.

01:50:48.850 --> 01:50:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So the messages
left by the ancients

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that we've explained here
were more than just prophecies

01:50:53.370 --> 01:50:56.330 align:middle line:84%
about a one world government
or a new world order.

01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We now understand why the
study of the heavenly bodies

01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:00.150 align:middle line:90%
were so important.

01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The rotation and orbit of all
that makes up our universe

01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:05.930 align:middle line:84%
serves as a clock to map
changes and transitions.

01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:07.590 align:middle line:84%
This helped the
ancients understand

01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that the change of
the heavenly bodies

01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:12.630 align:middle line:84%
were a mirror to the
changes of all existence.

01:51:12.630 --> 01:51:16.380 align:middle line:84%
December 21, 2012, is
simply a natural transition

01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:18.600 align:middle line:84%
from one form of
energy to the next.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The transcendental
evolution of man.

01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:24.230 align:middle line:84%
This date is what's
known as zero point.

01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Our sun, as well as
our planet Earth,

01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is losing its magnetic
field as the Earth

01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.890 align:middle line:90%
is slowing in its rotation.

01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:32.190 align:middle line:84%
All the while, its base
resonant frequency--

01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:34.640 align:middle line:84%
also known as the Schumann
cavity resonance--

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:37.200 align:middle line:84%
is increasing in accordance
with predictable sequence

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.660 align:middle line:90%
of the Fibonacci theory.

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:41.260 align:middle line:84%
At a cellular level,
our bodies respond

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:43.190 align:middle line:90%
to an electromagnetic pulse.

01:51:43.190 --> 01:51:46.110 align:middle line:84%
The ancients called
this the sacred circuit.

01:51:46.110 --> 01:51:48.540 align:middle line:84%
The cells receive this
pulse from the brain,

01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:51.150 align:middle line:84%
which receives its pulse from
the heart, which receives

01:51:51.150 --> 01:51:53.240 align:middle line:90%
its pulse from the Earth.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:56.230 align:middle line:84%
This pulse comes from the solar
system, which from there comes

01:51:56.230 --> 01:51:57.820 align:middle line:84%
from the galaxy,
which ultimately

01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:59.930 align:middle line:90%
comes from our entire universe.

01:51:59.930 --> 01:52:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We literally share a pulse
with all of existence.

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:06.825 align:middle line:84%
Yet another example of
everything being one.

01:52:06.825 --> 01:52:09.200 align:middle line:84%
For as long as scientists have
been recording the Earth's

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.570 align:middle line:84%
pulse, it has remained
approximately 7.8 cycles

01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:14.010 align:middle line:90%
per second.

01:52:14.010 --> 01:52:19.290 align:middle line:84%
This was a constant fixed
number until 1986 into 1987.

01:52:19.290 --> 01:52:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It rapidly began increasing
to about nine cycles

01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:24.540 align:middle line:90%
per second in 1996.

01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So in one decade, it increased
by about two cycles per second.

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.670 align:middle line:84%
By 2012, this
pulse will be right

01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:34.250 align:middle line:84%
around 13 cycles per second,
just as the Fibonacci theory

01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:35.680 align:middle line:90%
indicates.

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.920 align:middle line:84%
What does this
mean for humanity?

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Just as cymatics has shown
that higher frequencies result

01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
in more complex
patterns, we are now

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.220 align:middle line:84%
experiencing the
beginning of a major shift

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:48.150 align:middle line:84%
in both physical and
spiritual vibration.

01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:50.480 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to understand
what exactly will happen

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:53.575 align:middle line:84%
to our physical bodies, but
ancient, scriptures pagan

01:52:53.575 --> 01:52:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and monotheistic
religions, mystery schools,

01:52:56.230 --> 01:52:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and secret fraternal
orders have all

01:52:58.210 --> 01:53:01.030 align:middle line:84%
given indications as to what
this experience will be like.

01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:21.550 align:middle line:90%


01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:23.490 align:middle line:10%
This will be the
shift of the ages--

01:53:23.490 --> 01:53:27.390 align:middle line:10%
the transcendental period of
monumental changes to humanity.

01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:29.350 align:middle line:10%
Those unprepared
for this transition

01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:31.860 align:middle line:10%
will likely not be able to
cope with the rapid changes

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:33.280 align:middle line:10%
in the psyche.

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:35.650 align:middle line:84%
The only way to prepare
for what is to come

01:53:35.650 --> 01:53:39.930 align:middle line:84%
is what we have sought after
for our entire lives-- truth.

01:53:39.930 --> 01:53:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Not the truth about governments,
commerce, religions, terrorism,

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.800 align:middle line:84%
or anything external,
but the truth

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, within our
psyche and our shadow itself.

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Especially in Western cultures,
we are taught that being normal

01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:56.170 align:middle line:84%
means only being happy and
never sad, only loving and never

01:53:56.170 --> 01:53:59.260 align:middle line:84%
angry, only forgiving
and never jealous.

01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:01.770 align:middle line:84%
This sounds plausible,
but it is not.

01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We are not meant to repress
any negative emotions,

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.920 align:middle line:90%
because it causes imbalance.

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:11.010 align:middle line:84%
To conquer our emotions, we must
embrace them, not fight them.

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:12.880 align:middle line:84%
We must acknowledge
them, and allow

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.850 align:middle line:84%
them to serve their purpose
as we learn from them.

01:54:15.850 --> 01:54:17.750 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Essene
culture left teachings

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:20.350 align:middle line:90%
dating back about 6,000 years.

01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:21.780 align:middle line:84%
They taught that
our relationships

01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:23.780 align:middle line:84%
with one another,
with the universe,

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and with situations
and events are

01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:27.510 align:middle line:84%
mirrors of the
parts of our psyche

01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:29.460 align:middle line:90%
that need to be cleansed.

01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Author Greg Braden beautifully
explains this entire segment

01:54:32.730 --> 01:54:34.540 align:middle line:90%
at great length in his work.

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:36.790 align:middle line:84%
His hard work and
understanding of these subjects

01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:39.300 align:middle line:84%
contributed largely to the
marriage between science

01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:41.020 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It is very important
to understand

01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that when you fear loss,
fear death, fear war, fear

01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:49.380 align:middle line:84%
terrorism, or fear change,
you are giving others

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:52.570 align:middle line:84%
the ability to control
you based on those fears.

01:54:52.570 --> 01:54:55.510 align:middle line:84%
When you fight against
poverty or against racism,

01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:58.340 align:middle line:84%
when you fight for
relationships or for freedom,

01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.320 align:middle line:84%
you are outwardly
attempting to repress

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:03.850 align:middle line:84%
that which has been placed
before you to conquer inwardly.

01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:07.310 align:middle line:84%
These situations are
mirrors of our fears.

01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:10.670 align:middle line:84%
This is why it is important
to love and only love.

01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Love those who stand with you,
but especially those who stand

01:55:13.570 --> 01:55:14.820 align:middle line:90%
against you.

01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Don't look at your
fears as a threat.

01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Rather, understand that
this material world is only

01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:22.100 align:middle line:84%
a physical manifestation
of either the love

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:24.360 align:middle line:90%
or fear in your consciousness.

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:25.920 align:middle line:90%
It's as plain as day.

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:29.050 align:middle line:84%
All you need to conquer in
your life is in your face.

01:55:29.050 --> 01:55:31.970 align:middle line:84%
If you want to understand what
your true inner fears are,

01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:35.140 align:middle line:84%
analyze your ambitions
and your inhibitions.

01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything explained here
about the esoteric agenda

01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.170 align:middle line:84%
of the elite few at the
very top is nothing to fear.

01:55:41.170 --> 01:55:42.670 align:middle line:84%
They have been at
work for thousands

01:55:42.670 --> 01:55:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of years behind the scenes
to manipulate humanity.

01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:49.590 align:middle line:90%
And it has worked, until now.

01:55:49.590 --> 01:55:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>It's very easy for
any system of thought,

01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:54.690 align:middle line:84%
religious or otherwise,
that comes along,

01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:58.370 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to play on that,
to play on our insecurities,

01:55:58.370 --> 01:56:00.680 align:middle line:84%
to assure us all as well
we'll all be taken care of.

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:02.770 align:middle line:90%
We lap that up.

01:56:02.770 --> 01:56:04.730 align:middle line:90%
So don't blame religion.

01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Blame our own insecurities,
which has allowed religion

01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to flourish, and
which has allowed

01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:14.220 align:middle line:84%
so many systems of thoughts that
are disempowering to flourish

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.350 align:middle line:90%
throughout human history.

01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:18.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why we can't
get out of it.

01:56:18.730 --> 01:56:21.300 align:middle line:10%
>>Ron Sedgley, department
chairman chemistry

01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:23.400 align:middle line:10%
at University of
California, Berkeley,

01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:26.170 align:middle line:10%
showed that DNA acts as
an antenna for cellular

01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:27.880 align:middle line:10%
up regulation.

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:32.180 align:middle line:10%
The primary function they taught
us about what DNA is about,

01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:36.140 align:middle line:10%
it's a receiver and transmitter
of photons, light and phonon

01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:36.870 align:middle line:10%
sound.

01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:37.370 align:middle line:90%
But what?

01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Cellular up regulation?

01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that their water
molecules, the pyramid

01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:48.130 align:middle line:84%
power around the DNA
spiral energizing strands,

01:56:48.130 --> 01:56:51.890 align:middle line:84%
are taking in the spiritual
energy of love vibrations

01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and sending it out for
manifesting, precipitating,

01:56:55.340 --> 01:57:00.450 align:middle line:84%
in a quantum field-- the
physical matter of the body.

01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:02.770 align:middle line:84%
These are Hertz frequencies,
or cycles per second,

01:57:02.770 --> 01:57:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that the musicians can
retune their instruments

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:08.900 align:middle line:90%
to play and experiment with.

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are the
creator's musical scale,

01:57:12.710 --> 01:57:14.850 align:middle line:90%
the original solfeggio.

01:57:14.850 --> 01:57:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Buried for 3,000
years in the bible.

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient
priests who knew how

01:57:19.210 --> 01:57:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to levitate the huge stones for
the building of the pyramids,

01:57:24.110 --> 01:57:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and the Masonic knowledge
that predated ancient Egypt,

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:31.150 align:middle line:84%
the ability to have this
information, these frequencies

01:57:31.150 --> 01:57:34.460 align:middle line:84%
serve the function of creation,
destruction, and miracles

01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:37.470 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the
empowered people who

01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:40.640 align:middle line:90%
have access to this knowledge.

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:45.276 align:middle line:84%
I say that because
of this metaphor.

01:57:45.276 --> 01:57:49.630 align:middle line:90%


01:57:49.630 --> 01:57:54.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the difference between
the power of our creator

01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and anything else,
particularly evil.

01:57:58.450 --> 01:58:01.650 align:middle line:90%


01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:05.820 align:middle line:84%
That you can go into a
pitch-black room full of evil,

01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:11.120 align:middle line:84%
call of darkness, and
light a little candle.

01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, that
darkness flees.

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:19.240 align:middle line:90%
But you can't do the opposite.

01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:22.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't go into a well-lit
room full of truth, and wisdom,

01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and righteousness,
and joy, and health,

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:31.026 align:middle line:84%
and harmony with
the universal power.

01:58:31.026 --> 01:58:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can't take
any amount of darkness

01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and go into that well-lit room
and have any effect whatsoever.

01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:41.160 align:middle line:90%


01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:43.920 align:middle line:84%
That is the metaphor
which I frequently

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:49.442 align:middle line:84%
think of when I think
that I'm not empowered.

01:58:49.442 --> 01:58:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It is the greatest
lesson for me,

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and I think for
everybody else, to know

01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're on the
winning side, And that we

01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:00.210 align:middle line:90%
will win in the end.

01:59:00.210 --> 01:59:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>As you are watching this,
understand that is not

01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:04.900 align:middle line:90%
a fight to be fought.

01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.200 align:middle line:90%
It is not a war to be waged.

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.580 align:middle line:84%
No gun rights have
to be exercised.

01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Not a finger has to be lifted.

01:59:12.230 --> 01:59:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Most people wonder how one
person can make a difference.

01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:17.590 align:middle line:84%
They ask that if all
this is so simple,

01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and this information
is available,

01:59:19.650 --> 01:59:21.560 align:middle line:84%
why hasn't someone else
conquered their fears

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and changed the world
for everyone else?

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:26.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the most difficult
and beautiful conundrum

01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:28.140 align:middle line:90%
to our lives.

01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Your reality affects
you, and only you.

01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Your curiosity has led you
to this genre of information

01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:38.570 align:middle line:84%
to serve a very specific
purpose in your life.

01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:41.740 align:middle line:84%
To understand visually how the
universe is truly a hologram,

01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:43.780 align:middle line:84%
a math professor
at Yale University

01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:46.200 align:middle line:84%
developed the formula that
is plugged into a computer

01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.440 align:middle line:90%
program.

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Named after him,
the Mandelbrot set

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.220 align:middle line:84%
shows a seemingly
disorganized pattern.

01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how far
you zoom into the design,

01:59:54.970 --> 01:59:56.710 align:middle line:84%
you will always find
the same pattern

01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:58.630 align:middle line:90%
within the whole pattern.

01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Each fractal broken
down infinitely

02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:03.460 align:middle line:90%
will always reflect the whole.

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:05.830 align:middle line:84%
When one fractal
changes its pattern.

02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:09.200 align:middle line:84%
The sum total of the whole
pattern changes along with it.

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:11.590 align:middle line:84%
This exemplifies that
the whole world does not

02:00:11.590 --> 02:00:13.100 align:middle line:90%
need to be awoken.

02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.320 align:middle line:84%
There's no race to inform
the 6 billion people

02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:17.300 align:middle line:90%
on this planet of this message.

02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It is only important
that you personally

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
learn to conquer your innermost
fears and learn to love.

02:00:24.130 --> 02:00:26.880 align:middle line:84%
When you see your fears for
what they are, and master

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:32.260 align:middle line:84%
your emotions, then, and only
then, will you truly be free.
