00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But right before the
report's publication,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
the corporation would succeed
in pressuring the acting

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.687 align:middle line:90%
chief of the EPA in Washington.

00:09:00.687 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> We went into shock.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:84%
We had never heard of such
a thing being done ever,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
that the company that
we were regulating,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:84%
they would have the
right to review a report,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:84%
comment on it before
it's released.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And what did they
ask you about that?

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> That it was critically
important to say that people

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
were at risk, but they
did not want that.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:84%
They just basically want
to squash the report.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And eventually, the final
report, they prevailed,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and so they truncated it down
and removed critical sections

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and all the conclusions
were taken away.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Pressured by his superiors,
Milton Clark was forced

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:90%
to censor the report.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
The result, pollution
in Midland, Michigan

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
would continue for 30
years with impunity,

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.875 align:middle line:84%
and the executives at Dow would
continue denying the dangers.

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no health
problem in Midland.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely
no evidence of dioxin

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:90%
doing any damage to humans.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2006, one woman would
attack the multinational again.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
At the time, Mary Gade
oversaw all the officers

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
at the Environmental Agency
in the Midland region.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.375 align:middle line:90%
She had leverage.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
She'd been nominated by
the President of the United

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
States, George W Bush.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Newly appointed, she
demands that more testing

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:90%
be done in the city.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We found these astronomically
high levels of dioxin,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.810 align:middle line:84%
levels that my staff think may
be some of the highest levels

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.880 align:middle line:90%
ever found in the United States.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
was astonishing to me

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
when this came to my attention
was that for almost 30 years,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
this very serious problem had
not actually been addressed.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Where have you found
these high levels?

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>> We found it in yards
alongside the river system,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:84%
parks where children play,
where people launch their boats,

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
where fishermen put
their boats in the water.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.943 align:middle line:90%
This is where people live.

00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately called Dow
senior officials and said,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
we're very concerned
about these levels,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:90%
we need you to take action.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
As that unfolded, the
company was not happy.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely
expensive to clean up

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
this much contamination,
hundreds of millions

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:90%
of dollars, if not more.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> To lodge a complaint, Dow
goes directly to the White

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:90%
House.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I was asked on May 1 of
2008 to either resign or quit

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:90%
by the end of the day.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Were you surprised?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very much so.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.232 align:middle line:84%
In my 30 some years of working
in environmental protection,

00:11:43.232 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and much of that spent
in the government,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
expected that.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:84%
That was acting in
its own interests,

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
so Dow was trying to make sure
that it saved as much money

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> As a result of these
maneuvers, for decades,

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:84%
thousands of people have lived
surrounded by dioxin without

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.095 align:middle line:90%
knowing the risks.

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to meet these
victims, but in Midland, it's

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:90%
hard to loosen tongues.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Dow has supported the
city for 120 years,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and reminders are
at every corner.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
At the bank, the stadium,
the library, the public park,

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:90%
the high school.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
the shadow of the
company is everywhere.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Only one person agreed to
break the code of silence.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Alice Buchalter has
spent most of her life

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.985 align:middle line:90%
here near the river.

00:12:41.985 --> 00:12:43.485 align:middle line:84%
This is where she
raised her family.

00:12:43.485 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, this is where we used
to have the zip line way back

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We used to have all trails
that went down through here.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if you can
see any of them over here.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
But 18 years-- and the
land is very fertile,

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and it was used for motocross
trails, and hiking trails,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and dune buggy trails, and
just recreation in the woods.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
For a kid, it was
like a wonderland.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:90%
It was an adventure.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
They could explore, and
they could build forts,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and they could do
all those things.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> No one advised you that
there was dioxin down there?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We just that we found
a magical spot for us

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:90%
to play and raise a family.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> For nearly 40 years, the
Buchalter family would live

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
here, blissfully unaware of
their toxic surroundings.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Every spring, the river
floods their garden,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
bringing in a fresh
wave of dioxin.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Alice Buchalter
would not discover

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
the true extent of the
contamination until 2007.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:84%
When tests were
conducted in her garden

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
by the local environmental
agency, the levels of dioxin

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
were up to 17 times higher than
the legal limit for toxicity.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I have my oldest daughter
has autoimmune diseases.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You have five kids?

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.715 align:middle line:84%
>> How many of them do
have autoimmune disease?

00:14:32.715 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say all of them,
some to a lesser degree,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and some to a more
severe degree.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And my husband had a very
malignant colon cancer.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:90%
It was a real quick onset.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Her late husband, Herbert
Buchalter, was a doctor.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
A few days before he passed
away, he expressed a last wish.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> He was brave enough
to, when he was dying,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to have his blood drawn when
he didn't have very much blood

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Dioxin levels were
taken the Thursday

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:90%
before he died on a Sunday.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
He was willing to
do it to ascertain

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:90%
that there was a connection.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:90%
The results of my husband's.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:90%
This is his levels.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:90%
These are the actual breakdown.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Alice Buchalter's husband
had 64.5 nanograms of dioxin per

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
liter of blood, 3
times the US average.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We had been married
46 years when he died,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and would I have
treasured 10 more years?

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:84%
That's been a major
impact on my life.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The American Environmental
Agency has finally forced Dow

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to clean the river, but the
process has only just begun.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.997 align:middle line:84%
It could take decades
and cost hundreds

00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:10.955 align:middle line:90%
of millions of dollars.

00:16:10.955 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:84%
However, no date is set for
decontaminating neighboring

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:90%
yards, like Alice Buchalter's.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Dow refused all our
requests for an interview.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
The multinational
merely sent us an email

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
stating that, "we seek
science-based solutions that

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
protect human health
while also contributing

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.843 align:middle line:84%
to the well-being of
the local community."

00:16:36.843 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.380 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of the
world, another contamination

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:90%
is wreaking havoc.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
As a result of one of the
worst industrial catastrophes

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.350 align:middle line:84%
in history, thousands of
children have been affected,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:90%
but Dow has never dealt with it.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It happened in India in Bhopal.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
In 1984, the local
chemical plant

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:84%
exploded, killing 20,000
people and releasing

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.805 align:middle line:90%
tons of toxic products.

00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to Union Carbide,
a pesticide giant

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:90%

four months.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.990 align:middle line:90%

I picked it up and I
began reading about it.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It was talking about how
the rats were fed the C-8

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and what deformities that
it had around their face,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, that
sounds just like Becky.

Very similar, almost

That's why I knew that
there was something wrong.

Two out of seven children

However, we procured a

from DuPont.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:90%
It's dated 1982, 34 years ago.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:84%
In it, Mr. Carr, the medical
director at the time,

expresses concern about the
consequences of C-8 retained

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:90%
in the blood of employees.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:84%
He specifically recommends
that practical steps be

taken to reduce this exposure.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:47.260 align:middle line:90%

Why'd they lie?

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.110 align:middle line:90%

To make things worse,
DuPont has known since 1984

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that the molecules spread
into the region's tap water.

up to 50 times the
limit of toxicity

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.910 align:middle line:90%
if they got caught.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:84%
