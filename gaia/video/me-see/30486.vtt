00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:03.479 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.479 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK (VOICEOVER):
What would happen

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
if you had the chance to go
back in time and heal the past?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even say
some of the things

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:84%
you never had the courage
to say to the person

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:90%
who meant the most to you?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Does it make sense to even try?

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Or is it better to
let it lie there,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
like a memory in the
back of your mind

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:90%
that never seems to fade?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But what would you say if that
person was suddenly right there

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
in front of you, after
years of separation,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to see
deeper into their eyes

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
than ever before, maybe all
the way to your own heart?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Would it make any
difference at all?

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Or would it just tear open
the wound one last time,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:90%
just for old time's sake?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's best to
learn from your mistakes

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and become cynical, like
a war veteran who flinches

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:90%
every time they hear a gunshot.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But what if they weren't
mistakes at all, but the fire

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:90%
that tempers the steel?

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.488 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.728 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Anticipation's over.

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:19.636 align:middle line:90%
Catherine.

00:02:19.636 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:90%
You're here.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Strange, but true.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: You look great.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Hardly changed at all.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Don't begin with
a lie, Fredrick.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:90%
We've both changed.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Six years'll do that to you.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: -More
mature, that all.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're exactly
the same as I remember.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:90%
You look better.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Same face, but soft
around the eyes.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Softer?

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.837 align:middle line:90%
That's surprising.

00:02:56.837 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought
the opposite.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll reserve judgment
for later when I find out more

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%
about what you've been up to.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:90%
SERVER: Hi.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.145 align:middle line:84%
Could I get you folks
something to drink?

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:06.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd like an americano, please.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.109 align:middle line:84%
Can I have a minute?
SERVER: Sure.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.715 align:middle line:84%
I'll have the same
thing he's having.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Hang on a second.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.696 align:middle line:90%
Some things never change.

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
If I had ordered
a cappuccino, you

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
would have ordered a cappuccino,
but not after looking

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:90%
at the whole menu first.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.135 align:middle line:84%
That's what you
remember about me?

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:10%
And it's not even true.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.295 align:middle line:84%
Can I change my order
to a mocha, please?

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:33.774 align:middle line:90%
SERVER: Of course, ma'am.

00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:90%
So the dies have been cast.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like days have
gone by instead of years.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Makes you wonder if
it's even worth it.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who's to say you
didn't make the exact decision

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
that you were
supposed to back then

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and everything
turned out exactly

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:90%
the way it was supposed to?

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Why do we idealize what we lost,
as if we left ourselves behind

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and we're never
going to be happy

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.708 align:middle line:90%
again unless we get it back?

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The funny is that if he
was the one that left her,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
everything would be
reversed, and she'd be

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
the one all screwed up inside.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.330 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, she
has her own dilemma.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, there's a
part of us that wonders

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:90%
if we made the right choice.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And we go into a situation
hoping the other person's

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:90%
more lost than we are.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:90%
What if they're not?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It'd really suck if you got
back together years later

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and you were the one with
the bags under your eyes.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
My advice is that if
you have to do this,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
you get it over with
as quick as you can.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Past is gone, and
there's nothing

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.595 align:middle line:90%
you can do to get time back.

00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, on the other hand,
the heart has a logic the mind

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:90%
is never going to understand.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:90%
So why even try?

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
May as well just
get on with living.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: I was glad to
hear that you're married.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Susan, right?

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.619 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:90%
She's really great.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.675 align:middle line:84%
She understood that I
needed to do this on my own.

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You make it sound
like heart surgery.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.245 align:middle line:90%
I hope it's not that difficult.

00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Just strange, the whole thing.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I never thought it would happen.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Especially here.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Planet Ashland.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Hasn't changed much, has it?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.365 align:middle line:90%
It's grown, though.

00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:90%
It had to happen.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
It was an undiscovered
Shangri-La for so long,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and then California
realized we were here.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.167 align:middle line:90%
I liked it better before.

00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I used to tell people
it was a great place

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to live except for all
the hurricanes and floods.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.446 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look like it worked.

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, you didn't waste
much time getting out.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.738 align:middle line:90%
Let's not go there.

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: OK.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.809 align:middle line:84%
Where do you want to go?
-I don't know.

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Just being here
feels like a step.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:90%
A big step.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even catastrophic.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:90%
SERVER: Here you go.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.491 align:middle line:84%
All right.
OK.

00:05:56.491 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Were you nervous?

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually surprised at
how comfortable it feels.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure, especially
sitting here waiting.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
You're not even
a little nervous?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call
it nerves, exactly.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
More like a horse in
the starting gate.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I saw you, and I felt my
heart rate increase a little,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.731 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted
to get it over with.

00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: Great.
Could we get the check, please?

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I meant.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I meant the slow
approach, you know?

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Seeing you sitting
there looking around

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and me wondering what I'd say
if you didn't speak first.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Anticipation's over.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Not the best opening
line, but it worked.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's think of a better one.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:90%
A better opening line?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.016 align:middle line:84%
We might as well make
the moment memorable.

00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:90%
How about hello, Fredrick.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to see that the
years have treated you well.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could say the same
for you, dear Catherine.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But those years in
the cotton fields

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:90%
are bound to take their toll.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought 20
years of heroin abuse

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.222 align:middle line:90%
would make you look thin.

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:84%
High carb diet
took care of that.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:90%
So Susan couldn't come.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more about her.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We've been married
for about a year

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:90%
now, together for almost three.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.761 align:middle line:90%
She's really amazing.

00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I wonder if
I really deserve her.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.741 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Why do you say that?

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Just because I haven't
seen you in six years

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.905 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean I don't
know what you deserve.

00:07:37.905 --> 00:07:38.895 align:middle line:90%
That's funny.

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:42.309 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:43.008 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Why?

00:07:43.008 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I never really
got the feeling

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:90%
like I deserved you either.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And I kinda got the impression
that you agreed with me.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what you thought?

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:84%
If I recall, that's the
way it felt at the time.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, you let it go.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:90%
And now, you're happily married.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: And you?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Me what?

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:90%
You're not married?

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.767 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: No, but I am happy.

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I've had a few
serious relationships.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I just never felt like stopping.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Why do you see
marriage as stopping?

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.460 align:middle line:84%
There are an infinite number
of experiences out there

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and a whole lot of
people to have them with.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if I found someone
who understood me,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
someone who saw the
world the way I did.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:90%
But that hasn't happened.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Life has been full, though.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it has.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't surprise me.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.037 align:middle line:84%
None of what you just
said surprises me.

00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
You've always been
that way, at least

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:90%
as long as I've known you.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Settling down was
never your style,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
unless it was with someone
who was exactly like you

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:90%
or maybe the exact opposite.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same or
the exact opposite?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Probably opposite.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.775 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Why?

00:08:52.775 --> 00:08:53.875 align:middle line:84%
If it was someone
like you, that

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:90%
would have been too obvious.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened to us?

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
You think we were
exactly the same?

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a bit hopeful.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not hopeful.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way I saw it.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:90%
You thought we were soul mates.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that stuff.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that if you're
not ready to look at yourself,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
it's hard when
someone else reflects

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:90%
everything, both good and bad.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.737 align:middle line:90%
So tell me more about Susan.

00:09:18.737 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: You're trying
to change the subject?

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
My greatest fear about this
was this-- that we get together

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and rehash everything that did
or didn't happen between us.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just so easy to look back
and regret certain things.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:90%
But what good does it do?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:90%
We can't go back to them.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is see each
other for who we are now,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and know that maybe we helped
make each other that way.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:90%
I know you changed my life.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And there were times when it
just scared the hell out of me.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And those were the things that
I had to look at the most.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And I've done that.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I've looked into all
the scary corners

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and shed some light in there,
and you probably have too.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, maybe, we
can see something

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:90%
we didn't see back then.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the past is
gone, and I'm glad.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe we
did see it back then,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.071 align:middle line:84%
but we weren't ready
for what it meant.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever.
I'm just glad you called.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:90%
How surprised were you?

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.957 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever
been more surprised.

00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I never understood why you
ended it the way you did,

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.644 align:middle line:84%
but after so many years,
you just let it go.

00:10:26.644 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: You probably
think I broke off

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:90%
communications because of you.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, what else was
I supposed to think?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Did it ever occur to
you that I did it for me?

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:90%
That was one of your problems.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.964 align:middle line:90%
It was always about you.

00:10:39.964 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
You weren't the only
one who had feelings

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:90%
about what happened between us.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.105 align:middle line:84%
I had to break off
communication completely,

00:10:44.105 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
or else neither one of us would
have been able to move on.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:90%
It was the opposite for me.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I think the fact
that we never had

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:90%
any real closure kept it alive.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:84%
If I'd been able to talk
to you-- not all the time,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
but once in awhile-- it
would have been easier.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
It took a whole year before
I was able to let you go.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I find that hard to believe.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say that?

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:84%
You always went
through things fast.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:90%
I doubt I was any different.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:90%
How's your coffee?

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.039 align:middle line:84%
Now, who's trying to
change the subject?

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.005 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think you have
any ideas what I went through.

00:11:18.005 --> 00:11:21.244 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.244 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't think you have any idea.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:28.866 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:29.565 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:29.565 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry I broke
off communications.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.592 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that I regret.

00:11:40.592 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.032 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
things I regret too.

00:11:47.032 --> 00:11:49.422 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:11:49.422 --> 00:11:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But here we are,
six years later.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.116 align:middle line:84%
So are you still working
as a war correspondent?

00:11:57.116 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm still out there, I'm just
not doing the dangerous stuff.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I gave up the war zone
things a few years ago,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: I know.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that I was
disappointed to hear that.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: You know?

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.362 align:middle line:90%
Have you been following me?

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Yeah, I check
every once in awhile.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember when
we were together,

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
you went off to
this war in Africa,

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.687 align:middle line:84%
and I was sure I was never
going to see you again.

00:12:17.687 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the hardest
parts about being with you.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.286 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.286 --> 00:12:24.686 align:middle line:90%
You never let on.

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
It's because you didn't
see me when you were gone.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:90%
For you, it was easy.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: It wasn't easy.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Leaving you was never easy.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.831 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: So you'd
give it up for Susan?

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Besides, it's all about
taking risks these days.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:90%
It's too dangerous.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do now?

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: Mostly just
local freelance stuff.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I just wrote an article about
a local grade school that

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
won the world's record
for making the world's

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:90%
longest string of popcorn.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: No way.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Hey, it was picked up
by two wire services.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Besides, it keeps
me close to Susan.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.486 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: I never thought you'd
give up the wars for popcorn.

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:90%
It's more like they gave me up.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.214 align:middle line:84%
When I got married, I
was done taking risks.

00:13:11.214 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in my
life, I was determined

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:90%
not to screw up what I had.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Unlike before.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't take it personally.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like I just grew up.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I'd
hear you say that.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.811 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even
recognize me anymore.

00:13:27.811 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I do the garden.
I cut the grass.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
-I hardly believe it myself.
-Dog?

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Cat?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Two dogs.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Golden retrievers.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:90%
But no kids?

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Mm-mm.
No, we decided not.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.195 align:middle line:90%
At least not for a while.

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was really
scared to see you again.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Why?

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Afraid of old
feelings, I guess.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.062 align:middle line:90%
Afraid of the first few words.

00:13:55.062 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Afraid of the way that
I might look at you,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
or the way that you
might look at me.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: So how
does it feel now?

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It feels like no time
has passed at all.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Same cafe.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we should go to the park.
-I don't know.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.785 align:middle line:90%
That might be too much.

00:14:13.785 --> 00:14:15.885 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was the point of
this visit-- to heal the past.

00:14:15.885 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: I guess
it is part of it.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
-What's the other part?
-Don't worry.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that later.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Ah, mystery.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel to
have the tables turned?

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:90%
You thought I was mysterious?

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm shooting for transparent.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: I'm not
trying to be mysterious.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.381 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want
it to get too heavy.

00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Good, because I wanna
look back on this fondly.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: So how's it so far?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.909 align:middle line:84%
So far, so good.
It feels familiar.

00:14:37.909 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, I haven't been
back to Ashland since I left.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I moved about
four years ago.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.367 align:middle line:90%
I moved down to Sacramento.

00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:90%
That's where I met Susan.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Then we moved to the Bay Area.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in Phoenix.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I lived with my
sister for a while.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:90%
And then I got my own house.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm dying to hear what
happened to your book.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Nothing, really.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:90%
I self-published.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I did an internet thing.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.724 align:middle line:84%
I never could get a publisher
interested in it, though.

00:15:03.724 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing that made me
fall in love with you at first.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe what
a great writer you are.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.766 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Why'd you
never finish reading it?

00:15:09.766 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:90%
I read most of it.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: But you
never finished it.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.172 align:middle line:84%
It was just before I headed
off to Australia, you remember?

00:15:17.172 --> 00:15:18.305 align:middle line:84%
You had just
finished a new draft,

00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and you told me not to finish
reading until I got down there.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Then you broke up
with me a week before.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't gonna read it then.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Ah, you had a whole
year before that.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: I'm not trying
to make up excuses.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It just didn't feel
very good back then.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Look, you said that there are
certain things that you regret.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.725 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things I regret.

00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:34.325 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of ways I
didn't give everything,

00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:90%
even though I wanted to.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember that time I
got you that old bike?

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to go
riding all the time.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.950 align:middle line:84%
You went one, and I don't
think you ever went again.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You kept saying
that you felt silly.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't in shape.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
You worked my ass up and
down those hills so hard,

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
going to fall off.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:90%
You're in good shape now.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Thank god.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I go to the gym a
couple times a week.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: What?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if we
met now, how we would feel.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It'd be different.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.825 align:middle line:84%
It'd be different because
the people we are now

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:84%
were created, at least in part,
by us being together back then.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.367 align:middle line:84%
If we'd never met, I
might be a big fat slob.

00:16:19.367 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: I doubt it.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:84%
You were a pretty big
influence on my life.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.517 align:middle line:84%
I thought that-- I thought
if I changed enough,

00:16:28.517 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:90%
you might even come back.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.677 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:16:35.677 --> 00:16:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I started working
on it six years

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:90%
ago, right after you left.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wanted to make
myself into a better person,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
so I did something
every day that would

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.999 align:middle line:90%
make me into a better man.

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.665 align:middle line:84%
Some where in the back of
my mind, I thought you'd

00:16:46.665 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
move back to Ashland and
see how much I changed.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
start by accepting

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:90%
yourself for who you are.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
You can change your
face and your body,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't
change your attitude,

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make any difference.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
How many women, or
men, for that matter,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:84%
get plastic surgery
over and over

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:90%
and still don't like themselves?

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:90%
So no more books?

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
It's funny you should ask,
because I've been working

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:90%
on one for a couple months now.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: What's it about?

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, my last one
was about my mother,

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and probably didn't
get published

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:90%
because it was too intense.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to pick
a lighter topic.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Are you gonna tell me?

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:10%
KATHERINE: That's one of
the reasons I contacted you.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:10%
It's about our relationship--
everything that happened,

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:10%
and where it took us.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons
I wanted to contact you.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought I could make
up the where it took us part,

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
but the more I started writing,
the more I realized that I

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:90%
needed to find out the truth.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, where you are
and what you're doing.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.435 align:middle line:84%
So this is all a
part of your research?

00:17:53.435 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I guess it was at first.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But it made me
curious, you know?

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be lying if I said it
didn't stir my heart a little.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Stirred your heart.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.605 align:middle line:84%
You always act like I'm
some kind of snow queen.

00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
You're not the only
one who had feelings

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.327 align:middle line:90%
about what happened between us.

00:18:12.327 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the way
it felt sometimes.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: That's because
you never understood me.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:90%
It was always about you.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.006 align:middle line:90%
I did love you.

00:18:22.006 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Don't stop there.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I had to learn to love myself.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't expect someone
else to do that for you.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:90%
It has to come from inside.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Mm.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a nice concept.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the bottom
line is you couldn't

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:84%
stay in a relationship
with me for more

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:90%
than two months at a time.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:84%
One day, it would be the most
amazing time of our lives.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:90%
And the next day, it was over.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
How many times did
you break up with me?

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Five?

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:90%
It was only three.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: Yeah, but there
were two other times when

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.736 align:middle line:84%
we almost got back
together and you

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:90%
pulled the plug right before.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.941 align:middle line:84%
Those don't count as
two separate times.

00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:10%
Fine.
I'll put them together for one.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it seemed
like it was about you.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But I have a different
perspective on it now.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, you realize it
was all about you.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Don't use that to
try to make yourself

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:90%
sound like the innocent one.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.634 align:middle line:84%
You should be saying
the same thing.

00:19:14.634 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I should be saying
it's all about me?

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.155 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Exactly.
-Wait a minute.

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.806 align:middle line:84%
That's what you say
that I always say.

00:19:18.806 --> 00:19:20.920 align:middle line:90%
It's always about me, right?

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to confuse me.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't confuse you?

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Women love to say that to men.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize how
simple men are?

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Women are the ones
who are complex.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:84%
You say one thing, and
then a minute later,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:84%
you go off in the
opposite direction.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It's called nonlinear logic.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.861 align:middle line:84%
Women used to get burned
at the stake for that.

00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, by men who couldn't
understand what the hell

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Just because a
thought isn't rational

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that it's not true.
Wait a minute.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.346 align:middle line:90%
What were we talking about?

00:19:49.346 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
How did you get me
off the subject?

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're so
nonlinear, being off

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the subject shouldn't
be a problem.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:90%
What were we talking about?

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that you said
that you had realized

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:90%
that it was all about you.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.711 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: I don't think so.

00:19:59.711 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I think I was saying
that you should

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:90%
be saying the same thing.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Blame myself?

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: It's not
about blaming anyone.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, you have
to take responsibility

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:90%
for your own experiences.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way we're
going to learn anything.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.112 align:middle line:84%
And of course, learning
is what it's all about.

00:20:16.112 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:90%
You're so damn cynical.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.745 align:middle line:84%
Of course that's
what it's all about.

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It's better than going through
life thinking you're a victim.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I'm a victim.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I actually think it
was mainly my fault.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:90%
You know why.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:90%
That was just part of it.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:90%
That's not the reason.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.665 align:middle line:90%
I think it was.

00:20:41.665 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:90%
A pretty big part of it.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.685 align:middle line:90%
I should never have told you.

00:20:46.685 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: You think that?

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:54.305 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:57.317 align:middle line:84%
The last time that
we got together,

00:20:57.317 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was the
luckiest man in the world.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.065 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding.

00:21:00.065 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I really thought that.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, there was
this aching feeling inside me,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:84%
because I knew I had to
risk everything and tell you

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:90%
what I'd done a year earlier.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, having
you back didn't

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:90%
seem to make any difference.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:90%
That's not what broke us up.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Deep down, it probably did.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it planted
a seed in your mind,

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think you were
able to trust me after that.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a big risk
you took telling me.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Mmhm.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Probably wouldn't do it again.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.433 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: You would.

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:31.139 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:33.823 align:middle line:84%
If it meant holding onto
you, I probably would

00:21:33.823 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:90%
have kept it inside forever.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Those things never
stay inside forever.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.215 align:middle line:84%
They always have a way of
coming out, one way or another.

00:21:42.215 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Is all this in your book?

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:90%
But not the way you think.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
That was probably the bravest
thing you've ever done.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.146 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:21:51.146 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Going into a war zone was
nothing compared to that.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And it helped make you the
incredible person you are now.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.276 align:middle line:84%
I always felt like I cheated
more on myself than you.

00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:03.064 align:middle line:84%
I thought if I can
work it out inside,

00:22:03.064 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
then I don't even
have to tell you.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But the funny
thing was, the more

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that I worked it
out inside, the more

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I knew I needed to tell you.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It was like being redeemed and
condemned at the same time.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Really, Fredrick, I'm serious.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:90%
That's not what broke us up.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I had to find myself.
I don't know.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it would be
different if it were today.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
get over thinking

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:90%
that it was your fault.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter anyway.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Everything works out the
way it's supposed to.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Of course it does.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:90%
You're happy, right?

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.535 align:middle line:90%

Would that have been so bad?

Me having a son with you

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that would be a shock.

didn't even know was there.

to this book you're writing?

KATHERINE: It's
about falling in love

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and wondering who it is
you fell in love with

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and then realizing that
it was yourself all along.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:90%
You've lost me.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:90%
It's what I just said.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We need another person,
and a part of us

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
thinks that they have
something that we don't have

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:90%
anymore-- something we need.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And then all of our
hormones kick in,

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and we move hell and high
water to get that thing,

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and then not to lose it.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But that just makes us
unsatisfied, you know?

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It makes us crave
the real thing even

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:84%
more, which is why
so many marriages

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:90%
dissolve into complacency.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Which leaves the
obvious question.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
What is the thing that
we think we don't have

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:90%
that we search for in others?

-Understanding?
-Yeah.

This is nonlinear, right?

00:25:38.417 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
all searching for.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:90%
To understand who we are.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%

find that in somebody else?

You can't, stupid.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Though we keep trying.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the way,
we think we lost something.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And we keep searching
outside of ourselves for it.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:84%
What if the thing we thought we
lost was inside us all along?

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:84%
We just have to look
at the right place.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a hard time
seeing how this applies to us.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:07.292 align:middle line:84%
You could never understand why
I kept breaking up with you.

00:26:07.292 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It had nothing to do with you.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I kept looking for you
to give me something

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.600 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't think
I had anymore.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you didn't,
I became frustrated,

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and that wasn't
your job I really

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.580 align:middle line:84%
do think we were
meant to be together,

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
just not for the
reasons we thought.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.735 align:middle line:84%
Whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:26:22.735 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute.
What do you mean by that?

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall every
feeling that from you.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:90%
That's unfair, Fredrick.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I know you take
everything personal.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.874 align:middle line:84%
But don't make it
sound so horrible.

00:26:30.874 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
There are lessons we could
only learn by being together,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:90%
no matter how it turned out.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember
what I thought.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.026 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do.

00:26:38.026 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
You thought we were
going to get married

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:90%
and live happily ever after.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:90%
I did too for a while.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And when it didn't work
out, I had to look deeper.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I didn't
like what I saw.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that you
were one of my greatest gifts.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.580 align:middle line:84%
You have a pretty
strange way of showing it.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say that?

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Six years have passed,
and I haven't heard a word.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly, you
want to write a book

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
about it telling the world
what an amazing gift I was?

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.314 align:middle line:90%
You make it sound so horrible.

00:27:09.314 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not that it's horrible.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But from my perspective,
it completely sucks.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You break up with
me for the third

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.734 align:middle line:84%
or the fourth or the fifth time,
depending on how you define it,

00:27:17.734 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and even though you're
the most important

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
person in the world
to me, you decide

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:20.926 align:middle line:90%
we can't even communicate.

00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:23.417 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't wanna keep
beating a dead horse,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.894 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
what to do with that.

00:27:26.894 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It was like somebody
died and I didn't

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.359 align:middle line:84%
get a chance to
tell them how much I

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:90%
loved them or missed them.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you were able
to go off and have all

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:90%
these brilliant realizations.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't the same for me.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Catherine?

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that you?

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:90%
It's Mike.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.003 align:middle line:90%
You probably don't remember me.

00:27:43.003 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:84%
We had a date like
eight years ago.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Mike.
I do.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: I'm great.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought you move like
six or seven years ago.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: I'm in Phoenix now.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Are you still here?

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.911 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I doubt I'll
ever leave Ashland.

00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry.
I'm Mike.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: No.
-No.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Nothing serious.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.270 align:middle line:84%
This is Fredrick.
MIKE: Right.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I used to see you around town.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Are you guys married now?

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.580 align:middle line:84%
You were dating
back then, right?

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: No.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
We're just spending
the afternoon together.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't want
to, uh, get in the way,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:84%
but if you have time, why
don't you, um, give me a call?

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.820 align:middle line:84%
We could have
dinner or something.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.013 align:middle line:84%
That's my cell
phone on the back.

00:28:20.013 --> 00:28:20.840 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: OK.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, maybe.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.552 align:middle line:84%
It was really nice
seeing you again.

00:28:24.552 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:90%
It was nice to see you too.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Have a great walk.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:90%
(SARCASTIC) That was fun.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.324 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.324 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't have right
to get jealous.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.189 align:middle line:90%
You're married.

00:28:41.189 --> 00:28:44.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Look, back to what
I was saying before,

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I was holding onto
stuff for six years,

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have any
way of letting it go.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:55.791 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was why it was
important for us to meet.

00:28:55.791 --> 00:28:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So when I get to
Baghdad, that taxi

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.381 align:middle line:84%
drops me off at this hotel
called the El Rashid.

00:29:15.381 --> 00:29:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Mmhm.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
You gotta remember, I've been
on the road for like two days

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:90%
straight.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I get to
Amman, somebody

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.445 align:middle line:84%
tells me I have to take a
taxi all the way into Iraq.

00:29:23.445 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It was like this 12 hour
drive, tiny little car.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Driver speaks like
three words of English.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So we finally get to
Baghdad, which is literally

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:90%
my first steps onto Iraqi soil.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I get out of the cab, and
I'm walking up to the hotel.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And I look to the floor, and I
see this huge, really well done

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:90%
mosaic.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I see these old
Iraqi women spitting on it

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:90%
as they pass by.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm walking
over it, I see

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
that there's this face in the
center of the mosaic-- really

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:90%
big, with a snarl on his lips.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think, that
looks just like George

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Bush-- senior, of course.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I look back, and
sure enough, it is.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to walk
over George Bush's

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:90%
face to get into this hotel.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:90%
You're kidding.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.310 align:middle line:84%
No, that's not
even the best part.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the face in the
mosaic is a sign that reads,

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:84%
in English, "Bush
is a criminal."

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.164 align:middle line:84%
Those were your
first steps in Iraq?

00:30:14.164 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make me
feel all that welcome.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.600 align:middle line:90%
I thought, geez.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should tell
everybody I'm a Canadian.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.155 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to hate Canadians.

00:30:19.155 --> 00:30:22.651 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.651 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I met a few seedy
characters in Toronto.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.987 align:middle line:90%
So do you miss the danger?

00:30:28.987 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not the
danger that I miss.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It's more the perceived
danger and how

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
everybody thought about me when
I went to dangerous places.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:84%
It was never dangerous as
you think it's going to be.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
If you keep your head down
and follow a few basic rules,

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
for the most part,
you're going to be fine.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the guys who are always
looking for their big Pulitzer

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Prize winning photo.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:84%
They wind up pushing
the envelope too far

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and getting caught
in the crossfire.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I do miss people thinking
I'm hot shit because I

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.356 align:middle line:90%
traveled to war zones, though.

00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't get the same kind
of respect writing stories

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:90%
about popcorn.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you stopped, though.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Every time a conflict
broke out in the world

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.662 align:middle line:90%
I worried about you.

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:07.040 align:middle line:90%
That's funny.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Why?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when I
was heading to Iraq in '98?

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We had just broken up, you had
already cut off communication.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.331 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
scared about going.

00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Usually, I'm fine.
I never worry.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot
of people getting

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:90%
shot or kidnapped at the time.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.776 align:middle line:84%
And I had this terrible
feeling something

00:31:24.776 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:90%
was gonna happen to me.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So I left a message
on your cellphone

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.071 align:middle line:90%
asking you to call me.

00:31:31.071 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:84%
The idea of going over there
without some kind of completion

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.185 align:middle line:90%
with you made me sick.

00:31:34.185 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was
going to actually

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:90%
draw something bad to me.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.470 align:middle line:84%
All I wanted was
to say good bye.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.721 align:middle line:84%
No big scene, just a
two minute phone call.

00:31:42.721 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:90%
You never called.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.077 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.077 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I would have been fine
with a email, anything.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But instead, I wind up
going off to this war zone

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.960 align:middle line:90%
all screwed up inside.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.836 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
me to say to you?

00:31:55.836 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what you say now.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:90%
That's when I needed it.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Is it all right if
I just say that I was wrong?

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: You're
willing to admit that?

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what excuse I use.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling what I
was feeling at the time.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I should have
called, bottom line.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that feels better.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: You know, if we
look back and second guess

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:84%
every choice we ever made, we're
gonna be in for a long battle.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.981 align:middle line:84%
We all make mistakes--
you, me, and everyone else.

00:32:27.981 --> 00:32:29.970 align:middle line:84%
We're human.
We're all idiots sometimes.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea
how mad I was about that?

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.894 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Mad enough to
hold onto it for six years?

00:32:34.894 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:84%
It proved to me
that I wasn't screwed

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.150 align:middle line:90%
up one in the relationship.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought, damn,
if she won't even

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.134 align:middle line:84%
call me when I'm headed
to Iraq, maybe I'm

00:32:42.134 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:90%
not the one with the problem.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:90%
It made you right.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.070 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Yeah, I guess so.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Did that help?

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.679 align:middle line:84%
-Being right?
-Yeah.

00:32:48.679 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.487 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't even that.

00:32:53.487 --> 00:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, up until that
point, I had never

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.230 align:middle line:84%
been so close to
anybody in my life,

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
and then you pulled the plug.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I needed something
to get over. you.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I actually needed you
to be a bitch to me.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, did It work?

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:05.800 align:middle line:90%
For about a week.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.070 align:middle line:90%
And then what?

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Then, I was right
back where I started.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It took a year for the
pain in my gut to ease up

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.487 align:middle line:90%
and get you out of my dreams.

00:33:15.487 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd see these women
who reminded me of you,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and of course, I
was wildly attracted

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:90%
to every single one of them.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.600 align:middle line:84%
There's this Lyle Lovett song
that goes, (SINGING) I married

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.804 align:middle line:90%
her, she looked a lot like you.

00:33:29.804 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
If I could have gotten
with one of those women,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I would have done
it in a second.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:90%
You didn't jump in with anyone?

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.540 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: I wanted
to, but I didn't.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
in my life, I decided

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:90%
to take a break from women.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:84%
There were lots
of opportunities.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And I mean lots
of opportunities.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.317 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't do it.

00:33:47.317 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had to
feel everything that

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:90%
was coming my way and not run.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And first, all I wanted was a
woman to make the pain go away,

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that
wouldn't have helped.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So you took the
time to look within.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:01.850 align:middle line:90%
As much as I could.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.215 align:middle line:90%
Into-me-see.

00:34:03.215 --> 00:34:05.238 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:34:05.238 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Intimacy.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Into-me-see.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what intimacy is.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Looking within.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.900 align:middle line:84%
We always search for the
answers outside of ourselves.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's all inside.
-What about you?

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.000 align:middle line:90%
What'd you do?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I told do.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I had a few relationships,
nothing too dramatic.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.550 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.860 align:middle line:84%
You gotta to give
me more than that.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I just spilled my guts
out all over the sidewalk.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.949 align:middle line:84%
First, I thought about getting
back with my old boyfriend.

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Christopher?

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.730 align:middle line:90%
But you can never go back.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I knew that if I wanted to
get serious with anyone,

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I had to make a
clean break with you.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.005 align:middle line:90%
I noticed you did that.

00:34:41.005 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:90%
Don't you see why?

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I left Ashland because I
knew as soon as I saw you,

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:90%
it would start all over again.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.420 align:middle line:84%
There's this thing
between us that's

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:90%
intangible, like magnets.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.304 align:middle line:84%
-Do you feel it now?
-Yeah.

00:34:59.304 --> 00:35:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:12.448 align:middle line:90%


00:35:12.448 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Please
don't [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.876 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: That gigantic cat.

00:35:16.876 --> 00:35:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I know, he's so tiny.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.222 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:21.222 --> 00:35:23.582 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:35:23.582 --> 00:35:27.141 align:middle line:90%


00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
-OK.
-Are you still into this stuff?

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:84%
-As if you aren't?
-Whatever.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I read "Conversations with
God" like everyone else.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:90%
You read more than that.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.216 align:middle line:90%
You read more than I did.

00:35:37.216 --> 00:35:38.615 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: Are you
seeing anyone right now?

00:35:38.615 --> 00:35:41.035 align:middle line:84%
That came out of nowhere.
FREDRICK: Sorry.

00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:43.800 align:middle line:90%
It just crossed my mind.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Are you?

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I've become much choosier.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Is that supposed to
make me feel good.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Before, I was picky.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's worse.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.490 align:middle line:84%
-What changed?
-I guess I did.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I know what I want now.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.940 align:middle line:90%
So it took me to get you there.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: You, and a whole
lot of other experiences.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
No man that sparks that
fire breathing soul of yours?

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:84%
You were never short
of opportunities.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like me not being
able to imagine you

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.440 align:middle line:90%
settling down with one woman.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.121 align:middle line:90%
Are you serious?

00:36:13.121 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: That was
the thing with you.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Even when you were with
me, you weren't with me.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:17.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was trying
to tell you before.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:18.390 align:middle line:90%
How can you that?

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:84%
You always used to say
that, and it was never true.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
it was true or not.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It's what I was
feeling at the time.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was true for
you is not the point.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Of course it's the point.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what you're accusing
me of is not being faithful.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.740 align:middle line:84%
-Well.
-One time.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know that one
time is unacceptable.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But just like you've
been asking to understand

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.616 align:middle line:84%
how you're feeling, I
need you to understand.

00:36:39.616 --> 00:36:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Understand what?

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:84%
To this day, I still don't
understand what happened.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I was so in love
with you, and yet, I

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:90%
almost threw it all away.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I've never been so disgusted
with myself in my life.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.641 align:middle line:90%
Then why did you do it?

00:36:55.641 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I guess I tried to prove
that I didn't deserve it,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.710 align:middle line:90%
which is what I really felt.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.062 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, at least
now you understand.

00:37:03.062 --> 00:37:03.995 align:middle line:90%
I just hope you understand.

00:37:03.995 --> 00:37:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I understood back then.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.641 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think I forgave you?

00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Did you really forgive me?

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just some
temporary lapse?

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.561 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:37:11.561 --> 00:37:14.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I just can't
imagine being forgiven.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
exactly what it is.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:22.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why it never
healed inside of you.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.826 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever read this book?

00:37:23.826 --> 00:37:25.680 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: "The Dark Side
of the Light Chasers."

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.380 align:middle line:90%
It's about shadow work.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.710 align:middle line:84%
See, we all have
these shadow parts

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves that influence
nearly everything we do.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, we try to
hide them or get rid of them,

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and that just makes
them stronger.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:84%
This book is about embracing
them and integrating them

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.110 align:middle line:90%
into our lives.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Have you done that?
KATHERINE: Shadow work?

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It's brutal, but it works.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.290 align:middle line:90%
So what was your shadow?

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's none
of your damn business.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, we all
have tons of them.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I were
afraid of commitment,

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I would face that part, name
it, and make friends with it.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I would name her
Uncommitted Connie.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.380 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: What?

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It's silly.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I were
cheap, maybe I would

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.780 align:middle line:90%
name that part Charlie Cheapo.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:90%
You talking to me?

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:90%
You were always cheap.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.340 align:middle line:84%
You just pushed it aside so you
didn't have to deal with it?

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're like
Ridiculous Rita.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Well,
you're Denying Dennis.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Can we go back to being
just Fredrick and Catherine?

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Fredrick the frady-cat.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It sort of reminds
me of couples

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.050 align:middle line:84%
that always have
these cute little

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:90%
pet names they give each other.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But what happens to those
names when they split apart?

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Do they just dissolve?

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Or are they like windows into
worlds we think we forgot?

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's face it.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.140 align:middle line:84%
There's some things
we never forget.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:58.730 align:middle line:10%
Unless, of course,
you're Forgetful Frank.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.300 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: Do you think
magnets change with time?

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:07.707 align:middle line:84%
If you buried a magnet for six
years, would it lose its field?

00:39:07.707 --> 00:39:09.740 align:middle line:84%
If you put it next to another
magnet, would it still attract?

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.677 align:middle line:84%
I think this has more to do
with you and I than magnets.

00:39:12.677 --> 00:39:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Time doesn't seem
to have changed much.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Time doesn't change.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It just waffles.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Waffles?

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, like someone who
can't make up their mind.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Haven't you ever noticed
that one five year

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.320 align:middle line:84%
period may age you 10
years, while another

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:90%
gives you five back?

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Haven't you ever
seen two brothers

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.200 align:middle line:84%
who are about the same age but
live totally different lives?

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.940 align:middle line:84%
One feels totally
worn down by life,

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and the other doesn't seem
to be affected at all.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.310 align:middle line:84%
-You're losing me.
-OK.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:84%
There are these two
brothers, right?

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Little boys.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.226 align:middle line:84%
And one is a total
optimist, while the other

00:39:41.226 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:90%
is a total pessimist.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So one day, the parents decide
to even them out a little bit.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And for Christmas, they decide
to get the pessimist boy

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:90%
everything he could want.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.915 align:middle line:84%
While to the
optimistic, they give

00:39:51.915 --> 00:39:54.484 align:middle line:90%
a big box full of horse manure.

00:39:54.484 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:84%
What kind of messed
up story is this?

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Don't interrupt.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So then, Christmas Day comes,
and the pessimist boy opens up

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.350 align:middle line:84%
his presents to see that
Santa Claus has given

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:90%
him everything he could want.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.420 align:middle line:90%
And he's totally dissatisfied.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:84%
He's like, this
train won't work.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.860 align:middle line:90%
This truck's gonna brake.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to hear
what the other kid though.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So the optimist boy opens up
his presents to see that he has

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.530 align:middle line:90%
a big box full of horse manure.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And his parents look to see
how he's going to react.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, he starts
digging through it,

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.360 align:middle line:90%
having the time of his life.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And his parents ask
him what he's doing.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, I
figured with all this shit,

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:35.490 align:middle line:84%
there's bound to be a
pony in here somewhere.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why you
just told me that story.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.980 align:middle line:84%
It shows you that everything in
life is a decision, even time.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can have
everything you ever wanted

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and be totally dissatisfied, or
have a box full of horse shit

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and be the happiest
person on Earth.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
to the optimist boy

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:84%
when he realized
there was no pony?

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.857 align:middle line:84%
I never thought the
story through that far.

00:40:54.857 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to
remember what it is

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.223 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
about before you went

00:40:57.223 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:90%
off on that bizarre tangent.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.180 align:middle line:84%
That sometimes, the
things that we think

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.874 align:middle line:84%
are worst are really best
for us, and vice versa.

00:41:02.874 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have to
agree with you on that,

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.724 align:middle line:84%
especially in terms of what
we were just talking about.

00:41:06.724 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was the
worst thing I'd done,

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:90%
it changed me completely.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.000 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't done it, I might
not be where I am today.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.900 align:middle line:90%
In a great marriage to Susan.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.801 align:middle line:84%
Well, it took me a year to
realize that we were together

00:41:16.801 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
for whatever the
right reasons were,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.710 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
necessarily my reasons.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.296 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:41:23.296 --> 00:41:25.195 align:middle line:84%
If that hadn't of happened,
I might never have grown up.

00:41:25.195 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't call you a grown up.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.450 align:middle line:90%
As if you are.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm more grown up than you.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:31.841 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:33.740 align:middle line:84%
You're the one writing a book
about a failed relationship

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:90%
that ended six years ago.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and you're
the one who makes

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.850 align:middle line:84%
a living writing stories
about the longest

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.260 align:middle line:90%
string of popcorn in the world.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:90%
At least I make a living.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I make a living.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.219 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean?
I could buy a house.

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:45.639 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a house?
I don't think so.

00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:90%
I bet you Susan's rich.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:84%
We do own our own home.
-You do?

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.100 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE].
KATHERINE: How big is it?

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.439 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Oh, right.

00:41:51.439 --> 00:42:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: I was watching
this movie a while back

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.152 align:middle line:84%
about this couple
who meet in heaven

00:42:13.152 --> 00:42:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and decided that
they should find

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:90%
a way to get together on Earth.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.074 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Do they?

00:42:17.074 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: Yeah,
but they have to go

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.350 align:middle line:84%
through all this terrible
stuff before they can meet.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like they had
to learn whatever

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:84%
it was they came
to Earth to learn

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.444 align:middle line:90%
before they can get together.

00:42:25.444 --> 00:42:26.810 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: It's kind
of opposite with us.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.060 align:middle line:90%
How do you mean?

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, we met back then,
went through a lot,

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.914 align:middle line:90%
only to reunite now.

00:42:32.914 --> 00:42:34.470 align:middle line:84%
What would you say the
main thing that you've

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:90%
learned since then would be?

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.115 align:middle line:90%
The main thing?

00:42:37.115 --> 00:42:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Mmhm.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I guess it would be
that I can't expect

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.350 align:middle line:90%
anyone to give me anything.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I can't
find it inside,

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.840 align:middle line:84%
there's no use in looking
for it on the outside.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.900 align:middle line:84%
You sound like Dorothy
in the Wizard of Oz.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of esoteric
wisdom in that film.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.582 align:middle line:84%
Could you say do
that consistently?

00:42:55.582 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm getting
better at it all the time.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that I'm
perfect at it, though.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.324 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:43:03.324 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:90%
The main thing I've learned?

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.137 align:middle line:90%
Mmhm.

00:43:05.137 --> 00:43:06.270 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna laugh
if I tell you.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I won't laugh.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I learned that I'm
a pretty great guy.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS]
-Oh, is that all?

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a big
problem all along, wasn't it?

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I had all these people
telling me how great I was,

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.745 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't believe it myself.

00:43:17.745 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It actually happened
after we broke up.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I decided you didn't deserve me.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't deserve you?

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it was just
a defense mechanism.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It's what I told myself
to justify lot of things.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.050 align:middle line:84%
But now I know that
it doesn't have

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to do with deserving
anyone or anything.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I brought you into my life, just
like you brought me into yours.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it was
to learn about ourselves.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay with this
I didn't deserve you thing.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:90%
You really believe that?

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, do you remember the last
time that you decided that we

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:90%
should get back together?

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:90%
When I decided?

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.181 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:43:52.181 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:84%
You know I was just
sitting around waiting

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.350 align:middle line:90%
for the big chance.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds
said, but it's true.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you said that we
weren't going to actually

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:90%
be in a relationship.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.270 align:middle line:90%
We were going to be just lovers.

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:04.284 align:middle line:84%
If I recall, that
was your idea.

00:44:04.284 --> 00:44:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was just a
ploy to get you back.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.680 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: At least
you can admit it.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I also told you
that I hoped that we'd

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.450 align:middle line:84%
be able to say that we were
actually in a relationship

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.770 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.250 align:middle line:90%
I was very clear about that.

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And every time, it started
to get intense-- good

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:84%
intense or bad intense--
you had to remind me,

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:23.000 align:middle line:84%
don't forget, we're not
actually in a relationship.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:84%
If I had more
respect for myself,

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I would have said,
the hell with it.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.175 align:middle line:90%
I deserved more than that.

00:44:27.175 --> 00:44:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I deserve somebody who could
actually say the words.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Now you're pissing me off.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before,
that was your idea.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was honest with you too.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to jump back into
the way things were before.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.100 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to take it slower.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And there we were, right
back where we were before,

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:45.225 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think it was
worth taking the chance.

00:44:45.225 --> 00:44:47.810 align:middle line:90%
You never gave it a chance.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:84%
How in the hell was I
supposed to prove anything

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.740 align:middle line:84%
when you had already
decided that everything

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.550 align:middle line:90%
was already over?

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.430 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: I hadn't
decided that.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:90%
I was open to you.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I was open to even being more
serious than we were before.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: What does that mean?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I was even open to
the idea of marriage.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:90%
The idea of marriage.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Marriage is more than
an idea, Catherine.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I was open to more
than the idea of it.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't all hung up on
marriage like you thought.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't about that.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.864 align:middle line:84%
I would have liked to have been
able to have proven myself.

00:45:16.864 --> 00:45:17.730 align:middle line:90%
That would have been nice.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Why are you bringing
this all up now?

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.893 align:middle line:90%
Why are you even here now?

00:45:20.893 --> 00:45:23.797 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my heart's
being torn open again.

00:45:23.797 --> 00:45:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Look, did You.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Think we were just going to
hang out for the afternoon

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and just go home like nothing
ever happened between us?

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Six years have
passed, and I feel

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.415 align:middle line:90%
like you left me a month ago.

00:45:34.415 --> 00:45:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would be good
if we saw each other again.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It is good to see you again.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.760 align:middle line:90%
It's great to see you again.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't you remember why you left?

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It's because we can't
seem to be together

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.867 align:middle line:84%
without this amazing soul
thing happening between us.

00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You're like the one in the movie
that I loved before I was born.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Seeing you again just
reminds me of all that

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.725 align:middle line:90%
and how nothing has changed.

00:45:58.725 --> 00:46:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's just stop for a minute.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want it to get this.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was important
that we'd see each other again.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And what am I supposed
to do with it now?

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.570 align:middle line:84%
You-- you said before that
we didn't have to do anything

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.290 align:middle line:90%
with it, except maybe honor it.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:13.970 align:middle line:84%
You just said that the
one thing you learned

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:17.391 align:middle line:84%
was that you were a
great guy, and you are.

00:46:17.391 --> 00:46:19.290 align:middle line:84%
You said you realized that
you deserved a woman who would

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.290 align:middle line:90%
feel blessed to be with you.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you found
someone who feels that way.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.930 align:middle line:84%
You can be intimate
with her because you

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.629 align:middle line:84%
can be intimate with yourself.
-Listen.

00:46:27.629 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry if I'm blowing
our little reunion,

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but this is a lot
more difficult than I

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.454 align:middle line:90%
thought I was going to be.

00:46:33.454 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:84%
These things have been
kept inside for so long,

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and now they're just
exploding out of me.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.901 align:middle line:84%
I-- I just want you to
know how much it fucking

00:46:38.901 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:90%
hurt when you kept leaving.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:50.980 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know, this
is all good stuff.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad that
you're feeling this.

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.275 align:middle line:90%
Maybe now, you can move on.

00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I can.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Sweetheart, you have to.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
-Don't call me that.
-Sorry.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.560 align:middle line:90%
You know where we're sitting?

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.092 align:middle line:90%
Did you think I'd forget?

00:47:17.092 --> 00:47:18.895 align:middle line:90%
It all started here.

00:47:18.895 --> 00:47:21.420 align:middle line:90%
And ended here.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
come back here.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:24.335 align:middle line:90%
Too much for you?

00:47:24.335 --> 00:47:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Too loaded.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:30.711 align:middle line:84%
I remember those moments
more than any other.

00:47:30.711 --> 00:47:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you should take
what you said to me

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to yourself.
-Maybe.

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember what
you said to me here?

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Which time?

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:90%
The first time we got together.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I said that I wasn't
looking for a woman

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to complete some
empty space inside me.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Looking back, I was
completely deluded.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say that?

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.841 align:middle line:84%
You think we'd be doing
all this if that were true?

00:47:58.841 --> 00:48:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know.
Maybe that's the reason.

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, do you remember
what I said to you?

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.640 align:middle line:84%
You said you wanted
to give it a try.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I said.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I said that at first, I
didn't know if you were

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.710 align:middle line:90%
my brother or something more.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:17.505 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized I
had feelings for you

00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:18.888 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to explore them.

00:48:18.888 --> 00:48:20.720 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.170 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
happiest days of my life.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.980 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that the
happiest and the saddest

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.410 align:middle line:84%
should happen on the
exact same bench.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:29.860 align:middle line:84%
You haven't dug
it up, have you?

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:31.825 align:middle line:90%
It's like a monument.

00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I remember the day you called
me and told me that you had

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.270 align:middle line:84%
a surprise, and I should
wait for you at the store

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:42.580 align:middle line:90%
next to the brewery.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I see you standing there
with this mischievous grin

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.960 align:middle line:90%
on your face.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I walked past that store
probably 100 times.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But then, the idea that
we should have our hands

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.294 align:middle line:84%
cast together in plaster
hit me as the greatest idea

00:48:54.294 --> 00:48:55.900 align:middle line:84%
in the world.
KATHERINE: Yeah.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.740 align:middle line:90%
God, I love that thing.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I used to keep it as a
priceless piece of art

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.190 align:middle line:90%
in the center of my living room.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:03.830 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: That embarrassed me.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.364 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:49:05.364 --> 00:49:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe how
much you loved that thing.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.380 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: It was a symbol of
how much I loved you, Katherine.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why I couldn't
believe what you wanted

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.060 align:middle line:90%
to do with after we broke up.

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.290 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to forgive
me for that either, are you?

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.170 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to have a ceremony
where we would smash it.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:20.482 align:middle line:90%
I-- my god, cat.

00:49:20.482 --> 00:49:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The most precious thing
in the world, and you

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:23.200 align:middle line:90%
wanted to smash it.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I
wanted it destroyed.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Sort of like our relationship.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't do something
to the symbol

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.124 align:middle line:84%
and not expect it to
roll on into the reality.

00:49:32.124 --> 00:49:33.190 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: Your idea was better.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.860 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.190 align:middle line:84%
At least my idea was
a way of honoring

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:37.056 align:middle line:90%
who we were to each other.

00:49:37.056 --> 00:49:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I swear, I can
feel it vibrating.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.686 align:middle line:90%
Give me your hand.

00:49:44.686 --> 00:49:51.530 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.460 align:middle line:90%
You really feel something?

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I think
about it, and it

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.170 align:middle line:84%
makes me happy to
know that there's

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.180 align:middle line:84%
this monument to how
much we love each other

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:04.270 align:middle line:90%
that no one else knows about.

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I ever
wanted to, I could

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.252 align:middle line:90%
just come back to this bench.

00:50:07.252 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.714 align:middle line:90%
I've done that a lot.

00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:13.980 align:middle line:90%
KATHERINE: You have?

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.310 align:middle line:84%
We come back to
Ashland every year,

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and I always come back here
by myself and think about you

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and think about
what you're doing.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.073 align:middle line:90%
And here we are now.

00:50:24.073 --> 00:50:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And here we are now.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we should
do something special?

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:29.944 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:50:29.944 --> 00:50:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you could sing something?

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:33.797 align:middle line:90%


00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I think just being
here's enough.

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.910 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.468 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a new
chapter is beginning.

00:50:40.468 --> 00:50:43.360 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: How do you mean?

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.120 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: The fact
that we're here

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.345 align:middle line:90%
together after all these years.

00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's still this
energy between us,

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.220 align:middle line:90%
and these hands are radiating.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.175 align:middle line:84%
Just feels like something
new is beginning.

00:50:59.175 --> 00:51:01.270 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: I like that idea.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:02.680 align:middle line:90%
You do?

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.411 align:middle line:90%
Does that surprise you?

00:51:05.411 --> 00:51:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I was always concerned
about hurting you.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought that this
might be too much.

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:09.970 align:middle line:84%
FREDRICK: It is
in a lot of ways.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:13.337 align:middle line:90%


00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:14.780 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.704 align:middle line:90%
You said what you needed to.

00:51:16.704 --> 00:51:17.666 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:51:17.666 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:90%


00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we
could stay in touch

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and have it still be healthy?

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.014 align:middle line:90%
Part of me thinks it'd be fine.

00:51:29.014 --> 00:51:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Another part wonders if
I'll ever be able to be

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.512 align:middle line:90%
just friends with you.

00:51:32.512 --> 00:51:35.360 align:middle line:90%
You're probably right.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.591 align:middle line:84%
So how's this book
of yours going to end?

00:51:37.591 --> 00:51:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.115 align:middle line:90%
Is all this gonna be in it?

00:51:42.115 --> 00:51:44.610 align:middle line:84%
At first, I didn't
think so, but now I do.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect ending.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:48.386 align:middle line:90%
That's what we never had.

00:51:48.386 --> 00:51:51.284 align:middle line:90%
Do we ever really end?

00:51:51.284 --> 00:51:53.710 align:middle line:90%
I hope not.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.100 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: I doubt it.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.045 align:middle line:84%
You can't change someone's
life the way that we have

00:51:58.045 --> 00:51:59.995 align:middle line:84%
and just wrap it up in
some tidy little ending.

00:51:59.995 --> 00:52:02.910 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I never thought you
and I would be legendary.

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:06.345 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Legendary fools.

00:52:06.345 --> 00:52:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say that?

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've been fools
for love, especially me.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I carried you around
with me for six years.

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.490 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
this story that I

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.130 align:middle line:84%
heard about these
two Buddhist monks,

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.570 align:middle line:90%
one very old, one very young.

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're walking
along the river bank,

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and they see this
beautiful woman.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And she needs to get
to the other side.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.845 align:middle line:84%
So the older monk decides
that they should carry

00:52:30.845 --> 00:52:33.610 align:middle line:90%
her across, which they do.

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're walk along
for about an hour.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.567 align:middle line:84%
And the younger one hasn't
said anything in a long time.

00:52:38.567 --> 00:52:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, he
looks at his elder,

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and he says, why
did you force us

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to break our vows by carrying
that woman across the river?

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And the older one looks at him
and he smiles, and he says,

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.254 align:middle line:84%
I set that woman down when
I got to the other side.

00:52:52.254 --> 00:52:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Why are you still
carrying her around?

00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:00.060 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.572 align:middle line:90%
Time to set me down.

00:53:01.572 --> 00:53:02.516 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Yeah.

00:53:02.516 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:09.124 align:middle line:90%


00:53:09.124 --> 00:53:11.090 align:middle line:90%
How long you in town?

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I leave tonight.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I think I've finished
what I needed to complete.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:19.620 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna stick around for a
few days, visit a few friends,

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:24.450 align:middle line:90%
maybe see a play.

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I still love this town.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:27.735 align:middle line:84%
It's the best
place I ever lived.

00:53:27.735 --> 00:53:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I wonder
why I ever left.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.860 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.361 align:middle line:90%
Wanna get going?

00:53:34.361 --> 00:53:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we
should do something

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.556 align:middle line:90%
special with the hands?

00:53:37.556 --> 00:53:38.900 align:middle line:90%
I think we already have.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.270 align:middle line:90%
What did we do?

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.652 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think maybe now
they can rest in peace.

00:53:43.652 --> 00:53:46.604 align:middle line:90%


00:53:46.604 --> 00:53:47.588 align:middle line:90%
Feel it again.

00:53:47.588 --> 00:53:55.460 align:middle line:90%


00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It feels calmer.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.116 align:middle line:90%
FREDRICK: Is that a good thing?

00:54:00.116 --> 00:54:01.064 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:54:01.064 --> 00:54:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.675 align:middle line:84%
So do I get to
look at this book

00:54:08.675 --> 00:54:10.280 align:middle line:84%
before everybody else
in the world reads it?

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's from
my perspective.

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
anything to do with you.

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.520 align:middle line:84%
How could it not have
anything to do with me?

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
I write is about me.

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:21.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what intimacy is.

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Into-me-see.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:24.490 align:middle line:90%
You like that, eh?

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:25.800 align:middle line:90%
It's cute.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.120 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know if it's fair.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Life is never fair.

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll make
a movie about us.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.660 align:middle line:90%
A movie?

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Would that surprise you?

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.630 align:middle line:84%
No, nothing you did
would ever surprise me.

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It never has.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.925 align:middle line:84%
This is a great story,
but the ending sucks.

00:54:40.925 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:90%
The ending doesn't suck.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Years later, they meet,
reconcile the past,

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.760 align:middle line:90%
and go their separate ways.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.560 align:middle line:90%
That sucks.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It would suck even more if
it had a Hollywood ending.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Credits roll as we ride
off into the sunset?

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Unrealistic.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.373 align:middle line:84%
I was always the romantic
one in this relationship.

00:54:56.373 --> 00:54:58.670 align:middle line:84%
If that were true, your
movie would be a comedy.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:01.300 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.862 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

00:55:02.862 --> 00:55:04.870 align:middle line:84%
It's probably not the
ending a lot of you wanted,

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:08.150 align:middle line:90%
but that's really how life is.

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Perfect doesn't mean that
everybody gets back together

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.430 align:middle line:90%
and lives happily ever after.

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It's more about accepting
what really happens

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.356 align:middle line:90%
and just getting on with living.

00:55:16.356 --> 00:55:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the thing
I said before about getting

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.290 align:middle line:84%
over this pretty quick--
in retrospect, that

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.380 align:middle line:90%
probably wasn't very smart.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.815 align:middle line:84%
These things take as
long as they take,

00:55:24.815 --> 00:55:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing we
can do to rush them.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
we have the chance

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to look back over our lives
and see some of the things we

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.690 align:middle line:90%
missed the first time around.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we learn a lesson or
two and we get a little wiser.

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:41.370 align:middle line:84%
As for those hands,
well, let's just

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:44.190 align:middle line:84%
say that they're going to
be around as a reminder.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We just have to make
a choice about which

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:50.480 align:middle line:84%
monk we want to be-- either
the one who set her down

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.855 align:middle line:84%
or the one who's
still carrying her.

00:55:51.855 --> 00:55:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those choices
that we all have to make

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:55.020 align:middle line:90%
at one point or another.

00:55:55.020 --> 00:56:18.828 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.828 --> 00:56:21.804 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:56:21.804 --> 00:56:23.788 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:23.788 --> 00:56:25.772 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:25.772 --> 00:56:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.252 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:28.252 --> 00:56:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm the director,
and I appreciate

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:33.190 align:middle line:84%
very much your being here
tonight for the premier

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.700 align:middle line:90%
of "Into Me See."

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It's been a wonderful
evening for all of us,

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
continue the good times now

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:38.790 align:middle line:90%
next door in the restaurant.

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:39.823 align:middle line:90%
There'll be a little reception.

00:56:39.823 --> 00:56:41.633 align:middle line:84%
We'll get some wine
and cheese out for you,

00:56:41.633 --> 00:56:43.566 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll answer some
questions and schmooze a little

00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:44.480 align:middle line:90%
and just have a good time.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.380 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see you there, OK?

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And thanks again for
being here tonight.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.774 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:47.774 --> 00:56:50.244 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:56:50.244 --> 00:56:52.714 align:middle line:84%
Thanks, sweetheart.
Thank you.

00:56:52.714 --> 00:57:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you scared me.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.380 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was alone in here.

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I thought everyone had left.

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I'll live in a minute.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.521 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
say hello first.

00:57:20.521 --> 00:57:24.940 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.797 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:57:25.797 --> 00:57:29.533 align:middle line:90%


00:57:29.533 --> 00:57:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
you'd recognize me.

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Come over here.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:53.658 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.658 --> 00:57:54.800 align:middle line:90%
BOTH: You look great.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.461 align:middle line:90%


00:57:57.461 --> 00:57:58.980 align:middle line:84%
No, but you do.
You really do.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.930 align:middle line:90%
So do you.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.780 align:middle line:90%


00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.190 align:middle line:90%
How long has it been?

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:05.590 align:middle line:84%
20 years?
-22.

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:06.430 align:middle line:90%
But who's counting?

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So how'd you find
out about this?

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you think I'm going
to reveal my secret?

00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to let
you suffer a little more.

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.905 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so we're back to letting
me suffer again, are we?

00:58:17.905 --> 00:58:20.632 align:middle line:84%
You know what I really
want to know is why you

00:58:20.632 --> 00:58:22.540 align:middle line:90%
did this after so many years.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought
you would have moved on.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.096 align:middle line:90%
I did move on, completely.

00:58:27.096 --> 00:58:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to revisit the
moment, I guess, one more time.

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I got tired
of waiting for the book

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.930 align:middle line:90%
that you never wrote.

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:36.361 align:middle line:84%
I tried to write it.
I did.

00:58:36.361 --> 00:58:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But I just was never
happy with what came out.

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, somebody
had to tell our story.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.270 align:middle line:90%
So I thought I'd be the one.

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:43.302 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:58:43.302 --> 00:58:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Why was it so important?

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Why was it-- you really
don't know, do you?

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Ours was one of
the most important

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.844 align:middle line:90%
relationships in my life.

00:58:53.844 --> 00:58:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know anything
about relationships

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:57.130 align:middle line:90%
if it hadn't been for you.

00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:00.340 align:middle line:90%
You mean that.

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:02.756 align:middle line:90%
I mean it.

00:59:02.756 --> 00:59:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:08.320 align:middle line:84%
They pause awkwardly,
look at each other,

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and she goes on, changing
the subject abruptly.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.820 align:middle line:90%
So, um--

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to say.

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's get out of here.
CATHERINE: Let's see.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Where are you today?

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You've been married 23 years.

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Came back to Ashland
10 years ago,

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.260 align:middle line:84%
started your art magazine
five years ago, which is

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.650 align:middle line:90%
now read by half the country.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Your daughter's 20.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not mistaken, you're
gonna be a grandfather soon.

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:37.630 align:middle line:90%
I am very impressed.

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:38.820 align:middle line:90%
You're impressed?

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:40.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm impressed.

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:41.644 align:middle line:90%
How do you know all that stuff?

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:42.810 align:middle line:84%
You drop off the
face of the Earth,

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:44.474 align:middle line:90%
you know everything about me.

00:59:44.474 --> 00:59:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:47.003 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to tell
me that all the while I've

00:59:47.003 --> 00:59:50.690 align:middle line:84%
been following your life, you've
been following mine, are you?

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Jesus.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:53.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask you a second time.

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.470 align:middle line:90%
How did you find out about this?

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, just because
you're not creative enough

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to track someone down
doesn't mean I'm not.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I guess it depends
on how much one

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:03.390 align:middle line:90%
wants to, how much one cares.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not about caring.
It's about courage.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:08.030 align:middle line:90%


01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I-- I guess
the name change might

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
have tripped you up a little.
-No kidding.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't you tell me.
Is he here?

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah.
He's here.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.380 align:middle line:90%
He saw the whole film.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.260 align:middle line:90%
He saw it?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.460 align:middle line:90%
What did he think of it?

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, he loved me, hated you.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, how long have
you guys been in town?

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a couple of days.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.085 align:middle line:84%
We've just been
wandering around.

01:00:27.085 --> 01:00:28.020 align:middle line:90%
A couple of days?

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:31.062 align:middle line:84%
I even saw you in
the park yesterday.

01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%
You saw me?

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.855 align:middle line:90%
Well, why didn't you stop me?

01:00:33.855 --> 01:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
We could have had
lunch or something.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I know.
I know.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It was hard.
It was so hard.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But I really wanted
to surprise you here.

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
You did that.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.726 align:middle line:90%
You blew me away.

01:00:43.726 --> 01:00:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:47.090 align:middle line:90%
You saw me in the park?

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:49.147 align:middle line:84%
While I was sitting
on that bench?

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:49.901 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

01:00:49.901 --> 01:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
That exact same bench.
-Yeah.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.100 align:middle line:90%


01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.870 align:middle line:90%
You caught me.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I sit on that
bench all the time.

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I have.

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:05.050 align:middle line:90%
For a lot of years.

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Every time I sit
on that bench, it's

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.362 align:middle line:84%
like when we were
there together, you

01:01:09.362 --> 01:01:11.580 align:middle line:90%
and me, on that day.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.900 align:middle line:90%
That day.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.996 align:middle line:90%
That day you put on film.

01:01:14.996 --> 01:01:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It was so strange, watching
it and seeing every moment

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
just as I remembered
them all these years.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's nice
to know you didn't

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:23.140 align:middle line:90%
let those memories fade away.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.444 align:middle line:84%
Oh, did you really
think I would?

01:01:24.444 --> 01:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Did you really think
I would just walk

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
away and forget all about you?

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:27.765 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Yes, I did.

01:01:27.765 --> 01:01:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I-- I sometimes thought that.

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:29.883 align:middle line:84%
What else was I
supposed to think?

01:01:29.883 --> 01:01:31.165 align:middle line:90%
Well, you were wrong.

01:01:31.165 --> 01:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I wanted to tell you--

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the most important thing
I wanted to tell you

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
was all that time I was
throwing that word around,

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
intimacy, and feeling
like it was about finding

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.400 align:middle line:90%
myself and me finding me.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is true, and
that is important.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But what that word also means
is having someone else see me.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Letting someone else see you.

01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.733 align:middle line:90%
Letting someone else see me.

01:01:58.733 --> 01:02:03.830 align:middle line:90%


01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:04.529 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:04.529 --> 01:02:08.393 align:middle line:90%


01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:09.765 align:middle line:84%
It feels good to
hear you say that.

01:02:09.765 --> 01:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
It really feels good
to be able to say that.

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: So now, you know
why I made this film.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:16.266 align:middle line:90%
Now, you understood.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
I'd feel about it.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But oh, I was so touched
that you would remember.

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you didn't forget, but
you thought that I would?

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought you
might want to, more.

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:32.072 align:middle line:90%
Well, I did, for a long time.

01:02:32.072 --> 01:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
But you know, years go by.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I got into my soul
space about it.

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:37.959 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS]
No, really.

01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
probably perfect that it

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.760 align:middle line:90%
worked out that way in the end.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Part of our evolution.

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:45.410 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is hard at first.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
We always think our hearts
are never going to mend.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:49.890 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:51.620 align:middle line:90%
New people come into our lives.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Things change.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:59.620 align:middle line:84%
We-- but you never do
forget those who have meant

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.203 align:middle line:90%
so much to you before, do you?

01:03:01.203 --> 01:03:04.941 align:middle line:90%


01:03:04.941 --> 01:03:05.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.090 align:middle line:90%


01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm glad I came.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.990 align:middle line:90%


01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:20.680 align:middle line:90%
So am I.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and I, um-- I did something
that you might not agree with.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: What did
you do, Catherine?

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought it was time
for a little archaeological dig.

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.635 align:middle line:84%
You're not gonna tell you went
back to that park after I left,

01:03:30.635 --> 01:03:31.334 align:middle line:90%
are you?

01:03:31.334 --> 01:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I knew you'd made this film,
which was your way of blessing

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.170 align:middle line:90%
what happened between us.

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I just had to
find my own way.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.921 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was time we let
those hands breathe again.

01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Catherine.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:46.134 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's been 28 years,
and nature being what it is--

01:03:46.134 --> 01:03:47.786 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: What the hell is this?

01:03:47.786 --> 01:03:49.600 align:middle line:90%
CATHERINE: It's all that's left.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of white
dust mixed with the dirt.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I guess time has its way with
everything, including us.

01:03:56.350 --> 01:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, something for
you to remember me by.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Catherine, I can't believe
after all these years,

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
you've finally
given me the finger.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%


01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.896 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether this is
right or completely wrong.

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:18.340 align:middle line:84%
No, it's right.
It's right.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.580 align:middle line:90%
At least, I think it is.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'd buried those
hands all those years ago.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's not about the hands.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It's about the lessons we've
learned from each other,

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and those are just--
those are priceless.

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's just nice,
when you think about it.

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:39.445 align:middle line:84%
SUSAN: Sweetheart,
everyone's waiting for you.

01:04:39.445 --> 01:04:40.145 align:middle line:90%
What's taking you--

01:04:40.145 --> 01:04:41.911 align:middle line:84%
Darling, this is someone
I want to introduce you to.

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.781 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you don't need to
tell me who this is.

01:04:43.781 --> 01:04:45.791 align:middle line:84%
Catherine.
-Hi.

01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, wait a minute.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:47.456 align:middle line:90%
You two guys know each other?

01:04:47.456 --> 01:04:49.000 align:middle line:90%
When did you get to town?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we just came in early.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
I've been here a couple of days.

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:53.890 align:middle line:90%
This is how you found out.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.190 align:middle line:90%
That's right, James.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:56.850 align:middle line:90%
I did what you didn't do.

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:57.920 align:middle line:90%
I found her.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Hey, no fair.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:04:59.870 align:middle line:84%
She got married.
She changed her name.

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:00.569 align:middle line:90%
How'd you find her?

01:05:00.569 --> 01:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
A woman things past the
end of her nose, darling.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Courthouse has the
record of every marriage

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.530 align:middle line:90%
for the last 100 years.

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%
When you said you couldn't
find her under her own name,

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I put two and two together,
went the extra mile,

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:16.240 align:middle line:90%
became a real private detective.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
She had a right to see what
you had created in your film.

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I had the right
to finally meet her.

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad I came.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really glad that
you're the one who invited me.

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, guys, this is--
this is almost much more

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
than I could have hoped
for-- having both of you

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.340 align:middle line:90%
here like this at the same time.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot to take.

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not strange that
we're together at all.

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It should have
happened years ago.

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
There's something I
wanted to say to you

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:46.485 align:middle line:90%
since the day I met this man.

01:05:46.485 --> 01:05:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it OK if I ask you what
that thank you is about?

01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:52.590 align:middle line:90%
SUSAN: She knows.

01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:53.510 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:56.270 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And now I think it's
time we get to this party.

01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's wondering
where the director is.

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, you two have got
some confessing to do.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.056 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out how long
you guys have known each other

01:06:06.056 --> 01:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and gone through this
scheme [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
That's our little secret.

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:14.174 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

01:06:14.174 --> 01:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I forgot how beautiful
Ashland this time is of year.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:18.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like magic.

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:20.470 align:middle line:90%
It is magic.

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
be a great Christmas.

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Shall we?

01:06:24.720 --> 01:08:00.704 align:middle line:90%
