TO THE HEIGHTS
OF HIS FILMMAKING ABILITIES.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%

WITH "DR. STRANGELOVE"

ABOUT STANLEY KUBRICK'S
DARK COMEDY,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT WAS THE SCENES BOTH
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE B-52s.

WHAT THE INTERIOR
OF A B-52 LOOKED LIKE

BY TAKING MANY SEPARATE PHOTOS
FROM MILITARY MAGAZINES

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:90%
AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%

AN ASTONISHINGLY CLOSE REPLICA

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:84%
OF THE ACTUAL INTERIOR
OF A B-52.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT IT WAS THE EXTERIOR SHOT
OF THE B-52

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT REALLY EXCITED
THE BOYS IN THE PENTAGON.

OF THE B-52s FLYING OVER RUSSIA

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%

ESPECIALLY ON THE BIG SCREEN.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS SOMETIME IN THE FALL
OF 1963 OR THE WINTER OR 1964

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THEY CONTACTED
STANLEY KUBRICK

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
AND OFFERED HIM A DEAL
THAT HE COULD NOT REFUSE.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL,
IN A WAY,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:84%
OR AT LEAST, THAT IS HOW
STANLEY KUBRICK CAME TO VIEW IT.

I INTEND TO SHOW YOU

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT STANLEY KUBRICK
WAS NOT ONLY A FILMMAKER,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT THAT HE WAS PRIVY
TO THE MAIN SECRETS

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
OF AN OCCULT SOCIETY
THAT RULES THE EARTH.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%

RULE OUT THE CHANCE

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
TO PRESERVE A NUCLEUS
OF HUMAN SPECIMENS.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:90%

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:90%

HAVE TO STAY DOWN THERE?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:90%
WELL, LET'S SEE NOW.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
THE PENTAGON SAW
"DR. STRANGELOVE,"

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY KNEW
THEY HAD THEIR GUY.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
BUT FOR WHAT?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT EVERYTHING
WOULD CHANGE FOR KUBRICK.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
IF HE ACCEPTED THEIR OFFER,
HE WOULD GET ANYTHING HE WANTED.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
IF HE DECLINED,
THEY MIGHT JUST GET RID OF HIM.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:84%
IN A SENSE, ONCE THE OFFER WAS
MADE, STANLEY HAD TO TAKE IT.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:90%
AND SO STANLEY KUBRICK

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
ACCEPTED A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL,
SO TO SPEAK.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS WITH THIS DEAL AND WHAT
IT WOULD DO FOR STANLEY'S CAREER

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS
IN THIS FILM.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
ALTHOUGH WHAT YOU ARE
ABOUT TO SEE MAY OFFEND YOU,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I ASK THAT YOU STICK WITH
THE IDEA I'M ABOUT TO PRESENT

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:90%
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:90%
IT MAY MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT AS MORPHEUS SAYS
IN "THE MATRIX,"

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:90%
"I DIDN'T SAY IT WOULD BE EASY.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:90%
OVER THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE OF THE DEAL HE MADE,
KUBRICK WAS FREE TO MAKE FILMS

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT WOULD ALTER THE WAY
THAT WE LOOK AT OURSELVES,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:90%
OUR HISTORY, AND OUR DESTINY.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:90%
WITH THIS FREE MEAL TICKET,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK COULD HAVE GONE ON
TO MAKE JOURNEYMAN FILMS.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%
INSTEAD, HE USED THE MEDIUM

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
TO REVEAL THE DARKEST
AND THE LIGHTEST ASPECTS

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:90%
OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
SO, WHAT WAS THE DEAL THAT HE
MADE IN 1963 WITH THE MILITARY?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT DEAL WAS
THAT STANLEY KUBRICK WOULD FILM

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
AND FAKE
THE APOLLO MOON LANDINGS.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
IT HAS NOW BEEN 40 YEARS

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
SINCE THE FABLED MOON LANDING
BY NASA AND THE APOLLO GANG.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUBJECT
OF THE MOON LANDINGS,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
PEOPLE TEND TO FALL
INTO TWO BELIEF GROUPS.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
THE FIRST GROUP, BY FAR
THE BIGGER OF THE TWO GROUPS,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:90%
ACCEPTS THE FACT

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT NASA SUCCESSFULLY LANDED
ON THE MOON SIX TIMES

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT 12 HUMAN BEINGS

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:84%
HAVE ACTUALLY WALKED
ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000 align:middle line:84%
THE SECOND GROUP,
THOUGH FAR SMALLER,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
IS MORE VOCAL
ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS GROUP SAYS
THAT WE NEVER WENT TO THE MOON,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:90%
THAT THE ENTIRE THING WAS FAKED.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT
A THIRD POSITION ON THIS ISSUE.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:90%
THIS THIRD POINT OF VIEW

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
FALLS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
THESE TWO ASSERTIONS.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS THIRD POSITION POSTULATES
THAT HUMANS DID GO TO THE MOON,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT WHAT WE SAW ON TV
AND IN PHOTOGRAPHS

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:90%
WAS COMPLETELY FAKED.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:90%
FURTHERMORE, THIS THIRD POSITION

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
REVEALS THAT STANLEY KUBRICK
IS THE GENIUS

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
WHO DIRECTED
THE HOAXED LANDINGS.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:84%
IN SOME WAYS, NASA'S POSITION
WAS UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A COLD WAR

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:90%
WITH THE SOVIET UNION.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
DID WE REALLY WANT TO SHOW
THE RUSSIANS WHAT WE HAD?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:90%
IN FALL 1963,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
STANLEY KUBRICK HAD
JUST FINISHED "DR. STRANGELOVE"

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
AND WAS LOOKING TO DO
A SCIENCE-FICTION FILM.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000 align:middle line:90%
SOMEONE IN NASA OR THE PENTAGON

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:84%
SAW WHAT KUBRICK HAD DONE IN
"DR. STRANGELOVE" WITH THE B-52s

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
AND, ADMIRING HIS ARTFULNESS,
DESIGNATED KUBRICK AS THE PERSON

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
BEST QUALIFIED TO DIRECT
THE APOLLO MOON LANDINGS.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
IF HE COULD DO THAT WELL
ON A LIMITED BUDGET,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
WHAT COULD HE DO
ON AN UNLIMITED BUDGET?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
NO ONE KNOWS HOW
THE POWERS THAT BE

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
CONVINCED KUBRICK
TO DIRECT THE APOLLO LANDINGS.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:84%
MAYBE THEY HAD COMPROMISED
KUBRICK IN SOME WAY.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
KUBRICK ALSO HAD A REPUTATION

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
FOR BEING A NOTORIOUSLY NASTY
NEGOTIATOR.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:84%
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING
TO HAVE BEEN A FLY ON THE WALL

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN
KUBRICK AND THE PENTAGON.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THE END, IT LOOKS LIKE
KUBRICK FAKED THE MOON LANDINGS

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%
IN RETURN FOR TWO THINGS.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
THE FIRST WAS
A VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED BUDGET

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:84%
TO MAKE HIS ULTIMATE
SCIENCE-FICTION FILM,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:90%
"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY,"

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE SECOND WAS
THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
ANY FILM HE WANTED
WITH NO OVERSIGHT FROM ANYONE

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:90%
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
EXCEPT FOR HIS LAST FILM,
"EYES WIDE SHUT,"

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:90%
KUBRICK GOT WHAT HE WANTED.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:90%
IT IS UNCANNY

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
THE WAY THAT THE PRODUCTION
OF "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:90%
PARALLELS THE APOLLO PROGRAM.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
THE FILM PRODUCTION
STARTED IN 1964.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:84%
IT WENT ON TO THE RELEASE OF
"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY" IN 1968.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
MEANWHILE, THE APOLLO PROGRAM
ALSO BEGAN IN 1964

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
AND CULMINATED WITH THE FIRST
MOON LANDINGS ON JULY 20, 1969.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS ALSO VERY INTERESTING
TO NOTE

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE SCIENTIST
FREDERICK ORDWAY

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
WAS WORKING BOTH FOR NASA
AND THE APOLLO PROGRAM

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
AND WAS ALSO KUBRICK'S
TOP SCIENCE ADVISOR

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:90%
FOR "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
ONCE HE HAD NEGOTIATED THE DEAL,
STANLEY GOT TO WORK.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM
FOR KUBRICK IN 1964

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:84%
WAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE
THE SHOTS ON THE GROUND,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON,
LOOK REALISTIC.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
HE HAD TO MAKE THE SCENES
LOOK WIDE OPEN AND EXPANSIVE,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
LIKE IT WAS REALLY DONE
ON THE MOON

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
AND NOT ON SOME STUDIO BACK LOT.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
NO ONE KNOWS
HOW MANY THINGS HE TRIED,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT EVENTUALLY, KUBRICK SETTLED
ON DOING THE ENTIRE THING

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH A CINEMATIC TECHNIQUE
CALLED FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTION.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS IN THE USE
OF THIS CINEMATIC TECHNIQUE

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE FINGERPRINTS OF KUBRICK
CAN BE SEEN

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
ALL OVER THE NASA APOLLO
PHOTOGRAPHIC AND VIDEO MATERIAL.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:90%
[ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ]

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT WHAT IS
FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTION?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK DID NOT INVENT
THE PROCESS,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT
THAT HE PERFECTED IT.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTION
IS A CINEMATIC DEVICE

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT ALLOWS SCENES TO BE
PROJECTED BEHIND THE ACTORS

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
SO THAT IT APPEARS
IN THE CAMERA

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
AS IF THE ACTORS
ARE MOVING AROUND ON THE SET

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
PROVIDED BY THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:90%
THE PROCESS CAME INTO FRUITION

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THE 3M COMPANY INVENTED
A MATERIAL CALLED SCOTCHLITE.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
THIS WAS A SCREEN MATERIAL

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT WAS MADE UP OF HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF TINY GLASS BEADS.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
THESE BEADS WERE
HIGHLY REFLECTIVE.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION PROCESS,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN
WOULD BE PLACED

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:90%
AT THE BACK OF THE SOUND STAGE.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
THE PLANE OF THE CAMERA LENS
AND THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
HAD TO BE
EXACTLY 90 DEGREES APART.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
A PROJECTOR WOULD PROJECT THE
SCENE ONTO THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:90%
THROUGH A MIRROR,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE LIGHT WOULD GO THROUGH
A BEAM SPLITTER,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:84%
WHICH WOULD PASS THE LIGHT
INTO THE CAMERA.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
AN ACTOR COULD STAND IN FRONT
OF THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WOULD APPEAR TO BE
INSIDE THE PROJECTION.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:90%
TODAY, HOLLYWOOD'S MAGICIANS

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
USE GREEN SCREENS AND COMPUTERS
FOR SPECIAL EFFECTS,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000 align:middle line:84%
AND SO THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION SYSTEM

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
HAS GONE THE WAY
OF THE ADDING MACHINE

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:90%
AND THE MODEL T.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT FOR ITS TIME,
ESPECIALLY IN THE 1960s,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
NOTHING WORKED BETTER
THAN FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTION

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
FOR THAT REALISTIC LOOK
THAT WOULD BE NEEDED

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
BOTH FOR THE APE-MAN SCENES
IN "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE FAKED
APOLLO MOON LANDINGS.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
TO SEE HOW FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION LOOKS ON THE SCREEN,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:90%
LET'S EXAMINE THE APE-MAN SCENES

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
AT THE BEGINNING OF KUBRICK'S
FILM, "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
ONE HAS TO REMEMBER
THAT THE EARLY SCENES IN "2001"

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE ACTORS IN APE COSTUMES
WERE ALL DONE ON A SOUND STAGE.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
NONE OF WHAT YOU ARE SEEING
IN THE APE-MAN SCENES

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
AT THE BEGINNING OF "2001"
WAS ACTUALLY SHOT OUTSIDE.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:84%
THE SCENES THAT SURROUND
THE APE-MEN IN "2001"

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:90%
ARE ACTUALLY SLIDES OF A DESERT

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:84%
BEING PROJECTED
ONTO THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:90%
STANDING AT THE REAR OF THE SET.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
IN ORDER TO CREATE
THESE DESERT BACKGROUNDS,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK SENT A PHOTOGRAPHIC TEAM
TO SPAIN

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:90%
TO SHOOT 8x10 EKTACHROME SLIDES.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000 align:middle line:90%
THESE SLIDES ARE THEN PROJECTED

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:84%
VIA THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION SYSTEM

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:90%
ONTO THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
THE ACTORS IN APE COSTUME
STOOD IN FRONT OF THE SCREEN,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:90%
ACTING OUT THE SCRIPT.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:90%
IF YOU WATCH "2001" ON DVD,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE SEAMS
OF THE SCREEN OCCASIONALLY

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:90%
BEHIND THE GYRATING APES.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK WAS DOING
FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTION

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:90%
ON SUCH A HUGE AND GRAND FASHION

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE TECHNICIANS WERE FORCED
TO SEW TOGETHER

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:90%
MANY SCREENS OF SCOTCHLITE

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
SO THAT KUBRICK COULD CREATE
THE VASTNESS NEEDED

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
FOR THE APE SCENES
TO BE BELIEVABLE.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THIS SCENE TAKEN
FROM AN EARLY SCENE IN "2001,"

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN SEE THE SEAMS IN THE
BLUE SKY IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS NEXT IMAGE IS ONE
THAT I HAVE PROCESSED

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:90%
THROUGH A GRAPHICS PROGRAM.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:90%
IN THIS PROCESSING,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I HAVE INCREASED THE GAMMA
AND INCREASED THE CONTRAST.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
NOW WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE SEAMS
AND THE STITCHING

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:78%
OF THE SCOTCHLITE
FRONT-PROJECTION
SCREEN IN THE SKY.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
TO GET THE PERSPECTIVE CORRECT,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
ONE HAS TO REALIZE
THAT THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
IS RIGHT BEHIND
THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING SET

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
WHICH WAS BUILT
ON A SOUND STAGE.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
THE LINES ON THE SCREEN ARE THE
FLAWS IN THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
THESE FLAWS IN THE SCREEN
GIVE THE SKY A PECULIAR GEOMETRY

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THE IMAGE
IS PROPERLY PROCESSED

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
TO REVEAL THE FRONT-PROJECTION
SCOTCHLITE SCREEN.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
TO SHOW ANOTHER EXAMPLE,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
HERE IS A SCENE FROM
THE WATERHOLE SCENE FROM "2001."

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:90%
THIS IS THE SAME IMAGE,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT AGAIN WITH THE GAMMA
AND CONTRAST INCREASED.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
WHILE WATCHING "2001"
WITH THE SCENES OF THE APE-MEN,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
ONE CAN BEGIN TO SEE
THE TELLTALE FINGERPRINTS

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:90%
THAT ALWAYS REVEAL

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THE FRONT-PROJECTION
SCREEN SYSTEM IS USED.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE SETS THAT SURROUND THE
APE-MEN IN THE MOVIE ARE REAL.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:84%
THOSE ARE REAL ROCKS,
WHETHER PAPIER-MâCHé OR REAL,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
THAT SURROUND THE APE-MEN.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT BEHIND THE FABRICATED ROCKS
ON THE SET,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
THE DESERT SCENE
IS BEING PROJECTED

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:90%
VIA FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTOR.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
ONE OF THE WAYS
THAT YOU CAN TELL

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
THE FRONT-SCREEN SYSTEM
IS BEING USED

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT
THE BOTTOM HORIZON LINE

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%
BETWEEN THE ACTUAL SET

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE BACKGROUND
SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:90%
HAS TO BE BLOCKED.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK STRATEGICALLY
LOCATED ROCKS AND OTHER THINGS

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE SCENE

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:84%
IN ORDER TO HIDE
THE PROJECTION SCREEN.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
IN OTHER WORDS,
THE CAMERA AND THE VIEWERS

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
WOULD SEE THE BOTTOM OF
THE BACKGROUND-PROJECTION SCREEN

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:84%
IF IT WERE NOT BLOCKED
IN SOME FASHION.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:84%
AS PART OF THE TRICK,
IT BECOMES NECESSARY

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
TO PLACE THINGS IN BETWEEN
THE SCREEN AND THE SET

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
TO HIDE THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I HAVE PHOTOSHOPPED A LINE
DIFFERENTIATING THE SET

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE BACKGROUND SCOTCHLITE
FRONT-PROJECTION SCREEN.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:84%
PLEASE NOTE HOW EVERYTHING
IS IN FOCUS,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
FROM THE PEBBLES ON THE GROUND
IN THE SET

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:90%
TO THE DESERT MOUNTAINS BEYOND.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
YOU WILL SEE THAT HIDING THE
BOTTOM OF THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:90%
IS ALWAYS BEING DONE

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION SYSTEM IS BEING USED

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%
IN "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
HIDING THE SCREEN
IS ONE OF THE FINGERPRINTS.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:90%
IT IS EVIDENCE OF ITS USE.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:90%
JUST LIKE THE STAGE MAGICIAN

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:84%
WHO NEEDS THE LONG SLEEVES
OF HIS COSTUME

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
TO HIDE THE MECHANISM
OF HIS TRICKS,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
SO, TOO, KUBRICK NEEDED TO HIDE
THE MECHANISM OF HIS TRICK

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:84%
BEHIND THE CAREFULLY PLACED
HORIZON LINE

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:90%
BETWEEN SET AND SCREEN.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE
FROM "2001."

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
AND HERE IS THE SAME IMAGE
WITH MY PHOTOSHOP LINE.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
AS YOU WILL SEE
BEFORE THIS FILM IS FINISHED,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS SAME FINGERPRINT,
THIS SAME EVIDENCE,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:90%
IS CLEARLY SEEN

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
IN ALL OF THE NASA APOLLO STILLS
AND VIDEO IMAGES.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS THIS FINGERPRINT
THAT REVEALS

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:84%
NOT ONLY THAT NASA
FAKED THE APOLLO MISSIONS,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:90%
BUT HOW THEY FAKED THEM.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
LET'S EXAMINE
A FEW NASA APOLLO IMAGES NOW.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:90%
THIS IS A STILL FROM APOLLO 17.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:90%
THIS IS ALSO A GREAT EXAMPLE

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
OF THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION PROCESS.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN, I HAVE PHOTOSHOPPED
A LINE

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:90%
INDICATING THE BACK OF THE SET.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
ONE CAN SEE
THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT UPRISING

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:84%
BEHIND THE ROVER, WHICH IS
HIDING THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
ALSO NOTICE THAT EVEN THOUGH
EVERYTHING IS IN FOCUS,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
FROM THE LUNAR ROVER TO
THE MOUNTAINS IN THE BACKGROUND,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S A STRANGE CHANGE
IN THE LANDSCAPE OF THE GROUND

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:90%
RIGHT BEHIND MY LINES.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS BECAUSE THE PHOTO
OF THE MOUNTAINS

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
BEING USED
ON THE FRONT-PROJECTION SYSTEM

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
GROUND TEXTURE THAN THE SET.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
AS WE GO ON, WE WILL SEE
THAT THIS FINGERPRINT

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
IS ALSO CONSISTENT
THROUGHOUT THE APOLLO IMAGES.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
HERE'S ANOTHER APOLLO IMAGE.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:90%
NOW HERE IS MY VERSION

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
WHERE I SHOW THE LINE
BETWEEN THE SET AND THE SCREEN.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN, NOTICE THE TEXTURE
OF THE GROUND CHANGES

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:90%
RIGHT BEHIND MY LINE.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
NOW LET'S GO
TO SOME MORE APOLLO IMAGES.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
WE CAN SEE THAT
THE SAME THING OCCURS HERE

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:84%
AS IN THE APE-MAN SCENES
IN "2001."

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:90%
THERE IS ALWAYS A LINE

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
SEPARATING THE SET
FROM THE SCREEN.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
EVEN IF YOU DO NOT
SEE IT AT FIRST,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
IT WILL BECOME APPARENT
AS ONE GROWS MORE FAMILIAR

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION PROCESS

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000 align:middle line:90%
AND HOW IT IS BEING USED

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
TO FAKE THE ASTRONAUTS STANDING
ON THE LUNAR SURFACE.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
GO TO ANY NASA SITE
LIKE www.apolloarchive.com

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:90%
AND START LOOKING FOR YOURSELF.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
NOT ALL LUNAR SURFACE SHOTS
ARE USING THE PROCESS.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
SOMETIMES THE ASTRONAUTS
ARE JUST STANDING ON THE SET

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH A COMPLETELY AND SUSPICIOUS
BLACK BACKGROUND.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
THE EARLY MISSIONS,
APOLLO 11 AND 12,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:84%
USED THE FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTION
SYSTEM ONLY WHEN THEY HAD TO.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT AS THE MISSIONS WENT ON
AND THEY HAD TO LOOK BETTER,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK BEGAN TO PERFECT
THE PROCESS.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THE
FRONT-SCREEN PROJECTION PROCESS

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
ON EVERY MISSION,
THE SERIOUSLY REVEALING IMAGES

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:90%
ARE IN THE LATER MISSIONS,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
PARTICULARLY APOLLO 14, 15, 16,
AND -- MY FAVORITE -- 17.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:90%
HERE ARE A FEW FROM APOLLO 17.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
THE ASTRONAUT IS DRIVING
THE LUNAR ROVER

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
PARALLEL TO THE SCREEN,
AND THE ROVER

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
IS ONLY THREE OR FOUR FEET
AWAY FROM THE SCOTCHLITE.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
PLEASE NOTE HOW THE TIRE TREADS
JUST LEAD TO NOWHERE.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
ACTUALLY, THEY ARE GOING
TO THE EDGE OF THE SET.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:90%
IN THIS ONE, THE ASTRONAUT

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
IS ABOUT SIX FEET IN FRONT
OF THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
PLEASE NOTE HOW EVERYTHING
IS IN FOCUS,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
FROM THE ROCKS AND PEBBLES
CLOSE TO THE CAMERA

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
ALL THE WAY TO THE CRYSTAL CLEAR
MOUNTAIN BEHIND THE ASTRONAUT.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
AS WE SHALL SEE,
EVEN THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
ALSO, PLEASE NOTE
THE OTHER TELLTALE EVIDENCE

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT PERMEATES
THE APOLLO IMAGES.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S A STARK DIFFERENCE
IN THE GROUND TEXTURE

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:84%
BETWEEN THE SET AND WHAT IS
BEING PROJECTED ONTO THE SCREEN.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN ALMOST COUNT
THE NUMBER OF SMALL ROCKS,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE GRANULARITY
OF THE GROUND

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:90%
IS CLEARLY SEEN ON THE SET.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT ONCE WE GET TO THE SCREEN
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY LINE,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:90%
THIS GRANULARITY DISAPPEARS.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS NEXT IMAGE
IS A SLICK LITTLE PIECE OF WORK.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN FIRST VIEWED, ONE IS SURE
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:84%
ACROSS THE VAST, UNBROKEN LUNAR
SURFACE FROM BEGINNING TO END.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE EARTH RISING,
IT IS TRULY A STUNNING SHOT.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
BUT SURE ENOUGH,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
CLOSE EXAMINATION REVEALS
A SET-SCREEN LINE ONCE AGAIN.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGE
IN THE TEXTURE OF THE GROUND

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:84%
IMMEDIATELY
ON EACH SIDE OF THE LINE.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
THE LITTLE PEBBLES AND DUST

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
JUST SEEM TO DISAPPEAR
BEHIND MY LINE.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:84%
FORMER NASA CONSULTANT
RICHARD HOAGLAND

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
HAS EXAMINED MANY OF THE PHOTOS
OF THE APOLLO LANDINGS.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
EXAMINING THE PHOTOGRAPHIC
RECORD OF THE APOLLO MISSIONS

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:90%
AND PROCESSING APOLLO IMAGES

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
THROUGH VARIOUS
GRAPHIC PROGRAMS,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
HOAGLAND HAS DISCOVERED
GEOMETRIES IN THE SKIES

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
SURROUNDING THE ASTRONAUTS
ON THE MOON.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:90%
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, MIND-BLOWING
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS A CLOSEUP.
WE SEE THE HILLS.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
WE SEE JUST HINTS THAT SOMETHING
IS NOT QUITE RIGHT IN THE SKY.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN YOU SCAN IT
AND SIMPLY TURN UP THE GAME,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:90%
TURN UP THE BRIGHTNESS,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE ALL OVER THE SKY
IS A STUNNING SET OF GEOMETRY --

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
GLASSLIKE, SEMI-TRANSPARENT,
SCATTERING GEOMETRY,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:90%
SCATTERING BLUE LIGHT

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
WHICH TELLS US
THAT IT MUST BE FINE PARTICLES,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
FINE STUFF, VERY MICRON-SIZE,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH VARIOUS IMPERFECTIONS,
HOLES, SPARKLES --

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS WHAT KEN CAUGHT THEM
PAINTING OUT IN THE LRL

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU
CAN'T SEE STARS FROM THE MOON.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
THE BRIGHT THINGS
WERE NOT STARS.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
THEY WERE SHINING BITS OF GLASS
SCATTERING SUNLIGHT

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
RECORDED BY THESE PRIMITIVE,
BY TODAY'S STANDARDS,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
HASSELBLAD CAMERAS
ON 35mm EKTACHROME FILM.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
STARTING WITH THIS IMAGE,
WE THEN DID SECTIONALS.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
AND WE FOUND
THAT AS YOU ZOOMED IN,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:90%
YOU GOT MORE AND MORE DETAIL

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THIS SUPPOSEDLY BLACK SKY
ABOVE THE MOON.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
REMEMBER, IT'S A VACUUM.
NO ATMOSPHERE.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING HERE.
IT SHOULD BE PITCH BLACK.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT, AGAIN, IS WHY
THEY WERE PAINTING IT OUT.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS ALL FITS TOGETHER
AWFULLY, AWFULLY WELL,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
AND I USE THE TERM "AWFULLY"
WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY
AT THIS SECTION, YOU'LL SEE NOW

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THERE IS
A STUNNING 3-DIMENSIONAL,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:90%
GIRDER-LIKE GEOMETRY,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
A SCAFFOLDING, REBAR,
A STRUCTURAL MATRIX,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:90%
STANDING ABOVE THE MOON,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:84%
ANCHORED TO THE SURFACE
BY A SET OF SLANTED BUTTRESSES.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:90%
THE GEOMETRY IS PERFECT,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:84%
MEANING IT ABSOLUTELY
IS CONSISTENT

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH WHAT CONSTRUCTIONAL
TECHNIQUES WOULD BE THERE

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU HAD BUILT SOMETHING
MILES HIGH

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle line:84%
ABOVE THE CURRENT SURFACE
OF THE MOON.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU LOOK IN CLOSEUP,
YOU'LL SEE IN THE BUTTRESSES,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
THERE ARE LAYERS OF DETAIL.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS, AGAIN, IS, TO ME,
AMAZING, STUNNING QUALITY

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE WE HAD NOT HAD ACCESS
TO ANYTHING

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:84%
APPROACHING THIS LOW GENERATION
FROM THE APOLLO NEGATIVES.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
HE POSTULATES
THAT THESE GEOMETRIES

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
ARE EVIDENCE OF SOME KIND OF
GIGANTIC GLASSLIKE STRUCTURES

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
BEHIND, ABOVE,
AND SURROUNDING THE ASTRONAUTS

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
AS THEY STAND
ON THE LUNAR SURFACE.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:84%
HOAGLAND EVEN SHOWS US
THAT THERE ARE RAINBOW LIGHTS

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
REFLECTING IN THE SKY,
HIGH ABOVE THE ASTRONAUTS.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:90%
MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN NASA,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
HAVE ATTACKED HOAGLAND
FOR THESE INTERPRETATIONS.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
YET, NO MATTER HOW MUCH
THEY ATTACK HOAGLAND,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
THEY CAN NEVER EXPLAIN
WHAT IT IS

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT HE'S FINDING
ON THESE APOLLO IMAGES.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:90%
I, LIKE HOAGLAND,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
BELIEVE THAT NASA HAS
ACTUALLY GONE TO THE MOON.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I BELIEVE THAT MOON ROCKS

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:84%
WERE TAKEN FROM THE SURFACE
OF THE MOON.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS
STRONG EVIDENCE

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
OF SOME KIND OF PAST
INTELLIGENT ACTIVITY

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT STANDARD ROCKET TECHNOLOGY

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
IS WHAT GOT MANKIND
FROM THE EARTH

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:90%
TO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I'M NOT TRYING TO DEBUNK
HOAGLAND'S DISCOVERIES.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:84%
ALL I'M TRYING TO DO
WITH THE FOLLOWING EVIDENCE

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
IS TO SHOW THAT
THE APOLLO LANDINGS WERE A HOAX

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT STANLEY KUBRICK,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
USING THE FRONT-SCREEN
PROJECTION SYSTEM,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:90%
DIRECTED THEM.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M UNDERSTOOD HERE.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:78%
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
THERE ARE NOT STRANGE
STRUCTURES ON THE MOON.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT
THE STRUCTURES AND GEOMETRIES

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT RICHARD HOAGLAND
IS SEEING IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:84%
TAKEN ON THE LUNAR SURFACE
ARE NOT WHAT HE THINKS THEY ARE.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
HE BELIEVES THAT THESE IMAGES
ARE PROOF

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT NASA IS HIDING EVIDENCE
OF ALIEN CITIES.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS A PROCESSED PHOTOGRAPH
OF ASTRONAUT ED MITCHELL

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:84%
ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON TAKEN
DURING THE APOLLO 14 MISSION.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
OF COURSE,
ALL THE STUFF IN THE SKY

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:84%
AS SEEN IN THIS PROCESSED
APOLLO IMAGE FROM HOAGLAND

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
IS IMPOSSIBLE IF IT WAS TAKEN
ON THE LUNAR SURFACE.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S NO ATMOSPHERE
ON THE MOON.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE
NOTHING IN THE SKY.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:90%
YET WHEN HOAGLAND PROCESSED

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
MUCH OF THE APOLLO
LUNAR-SURFACE IMAGERY,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
HE DISCOVERED
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
ALL OF THIS CRUD IN THE SKY
ABOVE THE ASTRONAUTS.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
NO ONE IN NASA EVEN ATTEMPTS
TO ANSWER HOAGLAND

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
OR ANYONE ELSE
ABOUT THE STRANGE STUFF

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT HE AND OTHERS IS FINDING IN
THE SKIES ABOVE THE ASTRONAUTS.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
RICHARD HOAGLAND THEORIZES THAT
THIS IS PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
OF HUGE ABANDONED GLASS CITIES
ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:84%
HE SAYS THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING
IN THESE PROCESSED IMAGES

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:84%
IS HUGE GLASS TOWERS
THAT ONLY SHOW UP ON THE IMAGES

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
AFTER THEY'VE BEEN PROCESSED
THROUGH THE GRAPHICS SOFTWARE.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
HOAGLAND HAS TAKEN AN IMAGE
ON THE LEFT

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
AND PROCESSED IT IN A MANNER
VERY SIMILAR

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:84%
TO HOW I PROCESSED THE IMAGES
FROM "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
BY INCREASING THE GAMMA
AND THE CONTRAST OF THE IMAGE,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
HE ARRIVED AT THE PICTURE
ON THE RIGHT.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:84%
HOAGLAND INTERPRETS
THE IMAGE ON THE RIGHT

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
AS PROOF OF GIANT GLASS
STRUCTURES

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
BEHIND THE ASTRONAUT,
AND FOR THAT MATTER,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:84%
ALL OVER THE SURFACE
OF THE MOON.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
WHAT HOAGLAND IS REALLY SEEING,
THOUGH,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THE IMPERFECTIONS OF
THE BACKGROUND SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT KUBRICK USED TO CREATE
THE LUNAR BACKGROUNDS.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
THESE IMPERFECTIONS CAN ALSO BE
FOUND IN THE DESERT BACKGROUNDS

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:90%
IN THE APE SCENES IN "2001."

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:84%
LOOKING NORTH,
INTO TAURUS-LITTROW,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
HERE'S SUPPOSEDLY A MOUNTAIN,
HERE'S A BIGGER MOUNTAIN.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:90%
LOOK AT THE SKY UP ABOVE.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IN THE SKY,
YOU WILL SEE THIS INSET.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IN THE INSET, THERE IS
THIS INCREDIBLE RAINBOW.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:84%
WHAT HOAGLAND
IN THE ABOVE IMAGE REVEALS

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THE TEXTURE AND GEOMETRY
OF THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE OF THE VASTNESS
OF THE SET,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE HE NEEDED IT

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
TO LOOK LIKE IT WAS NOT DONE
ON A SOUND STAGE,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK HAD TO SEW SEVERAL
SCOTCHLITE SCREENS TOGETHER.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE HAD CREATED
A LARGE ENOUGH SCOTCHLITE SCREEN

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
WAS HE THEN ABLE TO GET
A LARGE ENOUGH BACKGROUND IMAGE

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:90%
THAT WOULD LOOK EXPANSIVE ENOUGH

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:84%
TO APPEAR TO BE THE SURFACE
OF THE MOON

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
OR A DESERT 4 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
THE SAME PROCESS THAT CREATED
THE DESERT BACKGROUNDS IN "2001"

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THE SAME PROCESS THAT CREATED
THE LUNAR MOUNTAIN BACKGROUND

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:90%
FOR THE APOLLO MISSIONS.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS A PICTURE
FROM HOAGLAND'S RESEARCH.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS PROCESSED IMAGE REVEALS A
RAINBOW-LIKE REFLECTING LIGHT

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
HIGH IN THE SKY ABOVE
THE ASTRONAUTS ON THE MOON.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:84%
HOAGLAND THEORIZES
THAT THIS IS LIGHT

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
REFLECTING OFF
ONE OF THE GIANT GLASS TOWERS

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:84%
STANDING RIGHT BEHIND
THE ASTRONAUT.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
WHAT THIS REALLY IS
IS A LIGHT

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:84%
REFLECTING OFF
ONE OF THE TINY GLASS BEADS

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:90%
OF THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
FOR SOME REASON,
THAT PARTICULAR GLASS BEAD

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
WAS SLIGHTLY OFF
FROM ITS 90-DEGREE ANGLE,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
AND SO IT CAUGHT
THE PROJECTOR LIGHT

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:84%
AND REFLECTED IT
BACK INTO THE CAMERA.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:90%
AGAIN, A SCENE FROM "2001"...

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
...AND NOW ONE OF HOAGLAND'S
PROCESSED APOLLO SHOTS.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR
THAT HOAGLAND'S GEOMETRIES

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
ARE REALLY THE PATTERNS
AND FLAWS

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
OF THE STITCHES
IN THE SCOTCHLITE SCREEN.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:84%
FURTHERMORE,
IF YOU LOOK IN THE BACKGROUND,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE
OF THESE AMAZING GLASS PRISM,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
PRISMATIC DISTORTIONS
CAPTURED BEHIND SCHMITT.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:90%
AND THE OVERVIEW IS THIS.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:90%
HERE'S THE WIDE ANGLE.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S THIS INCREDIBLE COLOR
WHICH CANNOT EXIST.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS IDENTICAL
IN PRINCIPLE TO THIS.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS SHOT OF THE GOLDEN GATE
LOOKING TOWARD THE EAST

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE SUN
SETTING IN THE WEST,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:90%
ERGO THE NAME "GOLDEN GATE."

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS ATMOSPHERE
SCATTERING RED, GREEN, BLUE.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
IT'S BASICALLY THE ATMOSPHERE
ACTING LIKE A MOVIE SCREEN.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT THERE'S MORE --
ONE OF THE MANY THINGS

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT MANY RESEARCHERS
HAVE DISCOVERED

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:90%
ABOUT THE APOLLO FOOTAGE

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT IF YOU SLIGHTLY SPEED UP
THE FOOTAGE OF THE ASTRONAUTS

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:84%
WALKING AROUND
ON THE LUNAR SURFACE,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:84%
THEY APPEAR TO BE DOING
THEIR BUSINESS IN NORMAL SPEED,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000 align:middle line:90%
LIKE THEY ARE ON EARTH.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS APPARENT THAT THE FOOTAGE
HAS BEEN SHOT IN SLOW-MOTION

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:84%
TO GIVE THE EFFECT
OF A LOW-GRAVITY SITUATION.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
IT SEEMS ODD
THAT ONE WOULD MOVE SLOWER

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
IN A LOW-GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT
BECAUSE THE LOW GRAVITY

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:84%
WOULD CAUSE EVEN LESS
RESISTANCE, NOT MORE.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THE SCENES IN "2001"
NEAR THE BEGINNING,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
WE SEE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIP
AND ON THE LUNAR SURFACE

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
ALSO MOVING IN A SLIGHTLY
SLOW-MOTION MANNER.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN, THIS DOESN'T MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:90%
IN A REAL-LIFE SITUATION.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000 align:middle line:84%
IF ANYTHING, THEY SHOULD BE
MOVING FASTER THAN ON EARTH

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE THERE'S LESS GRAVITY.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT SHOWING ASTRONAUTS
MOVING NORMALLY

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
REALLY CAUSES THE ACTION
TO LOOK UNREAL AND STAGED.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
SO KUBRICK DECIDED TO SHOOT
THE MOON SCENES

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:84%
BOTH IN "2001"
AND IN THE APOLLO LANDINGS

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:84%
IN SLOW MOTION
TO MAKE IT MORE CONVINCING.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:84%
IN A WAY, WE WERE BEING SET UP
BY THE FILM "2001"

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
TO ACCEPT THE ODD SLOW-MOTION
IN THE APOLLO SCENES.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN
ONE OF THE REASONS

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000 align:middle line:84%
TO RELEASE "2001" A YEAR
BEFORE THE APOLLO 11 LANDING.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:84%
BY CREATING A SLOW-MOTION
ENVIRONMENT IN "2001,"

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
THE AUDIENCE WOULD THEN ACCEPT
THE SLOW-MOTION ENVIRONMENT

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:84%
BEING PORTRAYED
IN THE APOLLO FOOTAGE.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE IS ONE THING
THAT I'M SURE OF.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:90%
SOME PART OF STANLEY KUBRICK

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:84%
WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW
WHAT HE HAD DONE,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT IS WHY
HE LEFT BEHIND CLUES

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHO DID IT AND HOW.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT ALSO,
WE CAN SEE THAT KUBRICK

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:84%
USED THE FAKING
OF THE APOLLO MOON MISSIONS

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE ONE GREAT FILM.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE HE HAD NEGOTIATED A DEAL

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:84%
WHERE NO ONE WOULD BE GIVEN
OVERSIGHT ON THE FILM,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK WAS ALLOWED TO MAKE
WHATEVER MOVIE HE DESIRED.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:84%
KNOWING THAT NO ONE WOULD OBJECT
TO HIS ANTI-HOLLYWOOD METHODS,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:84%
HE CREATED THE FIRST
ABSTRACT FEATURE FILM,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:90%
THE FIRST INTELLECTUAL MOVIE,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE GREATEST WORK OF ART
IN THE 20th CENTURY,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT
"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:90%

DRAMATICALLY ALTERS THE SCRIPT
FROM STEPHEN KING'S NOVEL

WHAT STANLEY KUBRICK
IS TRYING TO TELL US

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000 align:middle line:90%
IN HIS VERSION OF "THE SHINING."

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000 align:middle line:84%
IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD
FROM THE BEGINNING

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000 align:middle line:90%
THAT "THE SHINING"

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:84%
IS STANLEY KUBRICK'S
MOST PERSONAL FILM,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:84%
OUTSIDE OF POSSIBLY
"EYES WIDE SHUT."

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
BEFORE WE ARE DONE HERE,
IT WILL BE EASY TO SEE

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT STANLEY KUBRICK WAS
ONLY USING STEPHEN KING'S NOVEL

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:84%
AS A LAUNCHING PAD --
EXCUSE THE PUN --

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
TO BE ABLE TO TELL US
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
UNDER THE GUISE OF MAKING A FILM
BASED ON A BEST-SELLING NOVEL.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:84%
HE DID THIS
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT REASON --

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:90%
MAINLY TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT LET'S NOT GET
TOO FAR AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000 align:middle line:84%
IN FACT,
LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE ARE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS
IN THE FILM --

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK TORRANCE,
PLAYED BY JACK NICHOLSON,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000 align:middle line:84%
AND HIS SON DANNY,
PLAYED BY DANNY LLOYD.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND
HERE THAT JACK AND DANNY

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:84%
ARE TWO ASPECTS
OF STANLEY KUBRICK HIMSELF.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK IS THE PRACTICAL,
PRAGMATIC GUY

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:90%
WHO WANTS TO BE A GREAT ARTIST,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:84%
AND HE'S APPARENTLY WILLING
TO DO ANYTHING

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
TO ACCOMPLISH HIS GOAL
OF BEING AN ARTIST --

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:90%
A WRITER IN THIS CASE.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK, LIKE STANLEY,
HAS BLACK HAIR,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:90%
IS IDIOSYNCRATIC,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000 align:middle line:84%
AND EVEN SMOKES THE SAME
CIGARETTES AS STANLEY --

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000 align:middle line:90%

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:84%
DANNY IS THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE GREAT DIRECTOR.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:90%
HE IS THE CHILDLIKE KUBRICK.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS DANNY
WHO IS THE REAL ARTIST.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
THE DANNY SIDE OF KUBRICK
IS PSYCHIC, YOUTHFUL,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000 align:middle line:84%
AND SEES THINGS
THAT NO ONE ELSE SEES.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
DANNY HAS A TENDENCY
TO TELL PEOPLE THINGS

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
KEPT QUIET.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
THE OPENING OF THE FILM
TAKES PLACE

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%

MANAGER OF THE OVERLOOK HOTEL.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000 align:middle line:84%
THE DEAL BETWEEN JACK
AND THE MANAGER OF THE OVERLOOK

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT JACK CAN WRITE --
THAT IS, CREATE --

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:84%
ALL THAT HE WANTS AS LONG AS
HE TAKES CARE OF THE OVERLOOK.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:90%
ONE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT THE MANAGER
OF THE OVERLOOK TELLS JACK

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE PREVIOUS CARETAKER WENT
CRAZY FROM THE STRESS OF THE JOB

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:84%

ALSO WEAR RED, WHITE, AND BLUE

OF THE FILM.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000 align:middle line:90%
YEAH. I GUESS SO.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000 align:middle line:90%
WHAT ABOUT TONY?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
HE'S LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE HOTEL, I BET.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:90%
NO, I AIN'T, MRS. TORRANCE.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000 align:middle line:84%
NOW, COME ON, TONY.
DON'T BE SILLY.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE,
MRS. TORRANCE.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:84%
WELL, HOW COME
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:90%
I JUST DON'T.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THIS SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION,
THE OVERLOOK HOTEL IS AMERICA.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS BUILT,
JUST LIKE THE MANAGER SAYS,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:90%
ON THE GRAVES OF INDIANS.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000 align:middle line:84%

THE OVERLOOK HOTEL IS AMERICA.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:84%
LIKE AMERICA, THE OVERLOOK HOTEL
IS NEW AND SHINY.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS OSTENTATIOUS, CORNY,
AND ARCHITECTURALLY BORING.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:90%
AS THE MANAGER TELLS WENDY,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%

STAYED HERE."

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000 align:middle line:84%
-LOTS OF MOVIE STARS.
-ROYALTY?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:90%
ALL THE BEST PEOPLE.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
VERY DEEP HAPPENING.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK BRUSHED SHOULDERS
WITH THE ELITE OF THE WORLD.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:90%
HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
AND HE'S USING THIS MOVIE
TO TELL US.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND KUBRICK'S
STORY FROM HIS USE OF SYMBOLS.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:84%
AS I LIKE TO SAY, IF A PICTURE
IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000 align:middle line:84%
THEN A SYMBOL
IS WORTH 1,000 PICTURES.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
FOR IT WILL BE THROUGH THE USE
OF SYMBOL

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE REAL STORY OF
"THE SHINING" CAN BE REVEALED.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:84%
BARRY NELSON, WHO PLAYS
THE MANAGER OF THE OVERLOOK,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000 align:middle line:90%
WHILE INTERVIEWING JACK,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:84%
HAS AN AMERICAN EAGLE
RIGHT BEHIND HIS HEAD.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS AS IF THE EAGLE
IS THE POWER BEHIND THE MANAGER.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000 align:middle line:84%
NOT ONLY IS THE EAGLE
THE SYMBOL OF AMERICA,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED
THAT THE LUNAR LANDER

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:84%
OF THE APOLLO 11 MISSION
WAS CALLED THE EAGLE.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000 align:middle line:84%
TO THE MANAGER'S LEFT
ON THE DESK IS AN AMERICAN FLAG.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:90%
SYMBOLICALLY, THE MANAGER

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THE FACE OF THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK HAS CUT THIS DEAL
WITH THE GOVERNMENT

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:84%
TO BE THE CARETAKER
OF THE HOTEL.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:90%
IT SHOULD BE NOTED

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT BARRY NELSON
IS WEARING A TOUPEE,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:90%
WHICH MAKES HIM LOOK

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE JOHN F. KENNEDY.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
THE MANAGER TELLS JACK
THAT HIS MAIN JOB

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000 align:middle line:84%
IS TO PREVENT
THE OVERLOOK HOTEL --

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT IS, AMERICA -- FROM
APPEARING LIKE IT IS DECAYING.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000 align:middle line:90%
THE MANAGER REITERATES

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THIS IS JACK'S
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000 align:middle line:90%
IT'S NOT A VERY DEMANDING JOB.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:84%
THE ONLY THING
THAT CAN GET A BIT TRYING

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:90%
UP HERE DURING THE WINTER

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THE TREMENDOUS SENSE
OF ISOLATION.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000 align:middle line:90%
ON THEIR FIRST DAY IN THE HOTEL,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
DANNY HAS A VISION OF THE
PREVIOUS CARETAKER'S DAUGHTERS,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:90%
AND HE SEES THAT THEY ARE TWINS.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000 align:middle line:84%
THE PREVIOUS CARETAKER'S
DAUGHTERS

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
WERE NOT TWINS
IN THE STEPHEN KING NOVEL.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS DISCREPANCY
BETWEEN THE BOOK AND THE FILM

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:84%
WILL GROW IN IMPORTANCE
AS WE CONTINUE.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK, DANNY, AND WENDY
ALSO MEET DICK HALLORANN,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:84%
WHO IS THE COOK
FOR THE OVERLOOK.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
HE BEFRIENDS DANNY,
AND IT IS THROUGH HIM

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT DANNY DISCOVERS
THAT HE IS NOT ALONE

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN IT COMES
TO PSYCHIC ABILITY.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:84%
DICK WARNS DANNY
TO STAY AWAY FROM ROOM 237.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK, WENDY, AND DANNY HAVE
NOW FULLY MOVED INTO THE HOTEL.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S A LONG, COLD WINTER
AHEAD OF THEM.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:90%
AT FIRST, JACK LOVES THE HOTEL,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT HE IS HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH HIS WRITING.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:90%
ALSO, HE CANNOT SLEEP.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000 align:middle line:84%
MEANWHILE, WENDY AND DANNY
ARE HAVING FUN.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000 align:middle line:90%
JACK IS NOT WRITING.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000 align:middle line:84%
INSTEAD, HE IS THROWING
A TENNIS BALL AT THE WALL

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THE ROOM
WHERE HIS TYPEWRITER SITS.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000 align:middle line:84%
ON THE WALL WHICH IS BEING
STRUCK BY THE TENNIS BALL

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000 align:middle line:84%
IS A NATIVE AMERICAN
ARTISTIC MOTIF

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE A GROUP OF ROCKETS

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:90%
ABOUT TO BE LAUNCHED.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:84%
FINALLY, JACK THROWS
THE BALL AWAY

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IT DISAPPEARS
INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE HOTEL.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK WALKS OVER AND LOOKS DOWN
AT THE MODEL OF THE MAZE

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:90%
WHICH SITS OUTSIDE THE HOTEL.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000 align:middle line:84%
HE SEES WENDY AND DANNY CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAZE,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:84%
TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THE NATURE
OF THE DEAL

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT HE HAS CUT
WITH THE OVERLOOK.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000 align:middle line:84%
WHEN SHELLEY DUVALL AND DANNY
ARE RUNNING TOWARDS THE MAZE,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:84%
SHELLEY SAYS, "THE LOSER
HAS TO KEEP AMERICA CLEAN."

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:84%
THE LOSER HAS TO KEEP
AMERICA CLEAN.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000 align:middle line:90%
REMEMBER, JACK'S JOB

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000 align:middle line:84%
IS TO KEEP THE OVERLOOK
LOOKING LIKE IT'S NEW

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:90%
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000 align:middle line:90%
THE OVERLOOK IS AMERICA.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000 align:middle line:84%
THE LOSER HAS TO KEEP
AMERICA CLEAN.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:90%
20 FEET OF SNOW...

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
A COLD WINTER STORM
HAS NOW BLOWN OVER THE HOTEL.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000 align:middle line:84%
THE STORM IS A SYMBOL
OF THE COLD WAR

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000 align:middle line:84%
BETWEEN RUSSIA
AND THE UNITED STATES.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000 align:middle line:84%
OF COURSE, THE COLD WAR IS
ALSO ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:84%
FOR THE ENTIRE REASON
FOR FAKING THE MOON LANDINGS.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE LIVING
IN A VERY DANGEROUS WORLD,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS SHREWD
TO HIDE OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000 align:middle line:90%
FROM THE RUSSIANS.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS
FOR THE BEARS

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT ARE SEEN
ALL OVER "THE SHINING."

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000 align:middle line:84%
THE RUSSIAN BEAR
AND ITS COMPETITION

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000 align:middle line:90%
FOR THE RACE TO THE MOON

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:90%
WAS A DRIVING FORCE

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000 align:middle line:84%
BEHIND HAVING TO FAKE
THE APOLLO MOON LANDINGS.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000 align:middle line:84%
JACK, HIS FAMILY,
AND THE OVERLOOK HOTEL

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:90%
ARE TRAPPED IN THE COLD,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000 align:middle line:84%
JUST AS AMERICA WAS TRAPPED
IN THE COLD WAR WITH RUSSIA.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:84%
THE STUFFED BEARS
SEEN THROUGHOUT THE FILM

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000 align:middle line:84%
ARE SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTING
THE SOVIET UNION'S EMPIRE.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT THERE ARE OTHER EXPLANATIONS
FOR THESE BEARS,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000 align:middle line:90%
AND WE'LL GET TO THEM LATER.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:84%
SYMBOLICALLY, THE BEARS
SEEN THROUGH THE FILM

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000 align:middle line:84%
ARE ALSO THE REPRESENTATION
OF THE PRESSURE

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE RUSSIANS PUT ON
THE U.S.A. TO GET TO THE MOON.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE HE HIDES.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000 align:middle line:90%
WHERE DOES HE GO?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000 align:middle line:90%
TO MY STOMACH.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000 align:middle line:84%
DOES TONY EVER TELL YOU
TO DO THINGS?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TONY ANYMORE.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000 align:middle line:90%
DANNY IS RACING HIS TRICYCLE

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
DOWN THE HALLWAYS
OF THE OVERLOOK.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
SUDDENLY HE STOPS
AND SEES THE TWIN GIRLS

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:90%
AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:90%
IN UNISON, THEY SAY TO DANNY,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000 align:middle line:84%
"COME PLAY WITH US,
DANNY...FOREVER AND EVER."

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000 align:middle line:90%
COME AND PLAY WITH US, DANNY...

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:90%
FOREVER...

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000 align:middle line:90%
AND EVER...

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000 align:middle line:90%
AND EVER.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000 align:middle line:90%
[ OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING ]

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:90%
AT THIS POINT IN THE FILM,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
WE GRAPHICALLY DISCOVER
THE NATURE OF THE DEAL

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:90%
THAT JACK REALLY HAS CUT

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE MANAGER
OF THE OVERLOOK.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS THE MOST CRUCIAL SCENE
IN THE FILM.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
DANNY IS IN A HALLWAY,
PLAYING WITH HIS TRUCKS.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000 align:middle line:90%
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CARPET

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
HAS THESE STRANGE HEXAGONAL
PATTERNS IN THEM

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH A LONG LINE IN FRONT
OF THE HEXAGONAL PATTERN.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
NOW LOOK AT THESE PICTURES
OF LAUNCH PAD 39

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000 align:middle line:90%
AT CAPE CANAVERAL

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000 align:middle line:84%
AND SEE THAT THEIR LAUNCH PADS
LOOK VERY SIMILAR

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
TO THE PATTERNS ON THE CARPET
THAT DANNY IS PLAYING ON.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:84%
ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT DANNY
IS PLAYING WITH TRUCKS

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IT LOOKS ALMOST
AS IF THE TRUCKS AND EVERYTHING

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000 align:middle line:84%
ARE ON THE LAUNCH PAD
SURROUNDING THE ROCKET.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000 align:middle line:90%
BUT WHERE IS THE ROCKET?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000 align:middle line:90%
SUDDENLY, OUT OF NOWHERE,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000 align:middle line:84%
THE OVERLOOK HOTEL ROLLS
THE TENNIS BALL FROM NOWHERE,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000 align:middle line:84%
THE TENNIS BALL
THAT JACK LOST EARLIER.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS A GESTURE, AND THE GESTURE
SAYS, "WANT TO PLAY?"

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000 align:middle line:84%
MYSTIFIED BY WHERE THE BALL
CAME FROM, DANNY STANDS UP,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:90%
AND THE AUDIENCE FINALLY SEES

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000 align:middle line:84%
WHAT THE NATURE OF THE
SECRET PROJECT IS REALLY ABOUT.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000 align:middle line:84%
AS DANNY STANDS UP, THE ANSWER
IS REVEALED IN AN INSTANT.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000 align:middle line:90%
DANNY IS WEARING A SWEATER

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH A CRUDELY SEWN ROCKET
PICTURED ON THE FRONT.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:84%
ABOVE THE ROCKET
CLEARLY SEEN ON DANNY'S SWEATER

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:90%
ARE THE WORDS "APOLLO 11."

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000 align:middle line:90%
THE AUDIENCE WATCHING THE FILM

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:84%
LITERALLY SEES THE LAUNCH
OF APOLLO 11

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000 align:middle line:84%
RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES AS DANNY
RISES UP FROM THE FLOOR.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:84%
IT ISN'T THE REAL LAUNCH
OF APOLLO 11.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS, OF COURSE, THE SYMBOLIC
LAUNCHING OF APOLLO 11.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000 align:middle line:90%
IN OTHER WORDS, IT ISN'T REAL.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000 align:middle line:90%
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS CRUCIAL

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:84%
TO UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT HAPPENS IN THIS FILM.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
DANNY, BEWILDERED,
WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:84%
HE SEES THAT ROOM 237, THE ROOM
THAT HALLORANN WARNED HIM ABOUT,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000 align:middle line:84%
HAS A KEY IN THE LOCK,
AND THE DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000 align:middle line:84%
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW
THAT THE ROOM IN QUESTION

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000 align:middle line:90%
WAS NUMBER 217

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THE STEPHEN KING VERSION
OF "THE SHINING."

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:84%
FOR REASONS UNKNOWN,
KUBRICK CHANGED IT TO 237.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000 align:middle line:90%
MOM, ARE YOU IN THERE?

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000 align:middle line:84%
THOSE UNKNOWN REASONS
ARE ABOUT TO BECOME KNOWN.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000 align:middle line:84%
DANNY IS LITERALLY CARRYING
A SYMBOLIC APOLLO 11 ON HIS BODY

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000 align:middle line:84%
VIA THE SWEATER TO THE MOON
AS HE WALKS OVER TO ROOM 237.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:90%
WHY DO I THINK THIS?

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE THE AVERAGE DISTANCE
FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000 align:middle line:90%
IS 237,000 MILES.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000 align:middle line:84%
NOW, SOME PEOPLE
MAY ARGUE WITH THIS

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:84%
AND SAY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY
238,000 MILES AND CHANGE.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000 align:middle line:84%
THE MOON IS
IN A SLIGHTLY ELLIPTICAL ORBIT,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000 align:middle line:90%
WHICH MEANS SOMETIMES THE MOON

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:84%
IS MUCH FURTHER AWAY FROM
THE EARTH THAN AT OTHER TIMES.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU DO THE MATH
AND YOU FIGURE IT OUT,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN SEE
THAT THE TRUE DISTANCE

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE MOON IS FROM THE EARTH
IS 237,000 MILES.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:84%

AT THE TIME THAT KUBRICK
FAKED THE APOLLO MOON LANDINGS,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000 align:middle line:84%
IN THE TEXTBOOKS
AND THE SCIENTIFIC WORK

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE MOON WAS 237,000 MILES
AWAY FROM THE EARTH.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS THE FIGURE
THAT STANLEY WAS WORKING WITH,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT IS WHY HE CHANGED
THE ROOM FROM 217 TO 237.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000 align:middle line:84%
THE REAL TRUTH
IS THAT THIS MOVIE

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000 align:middle line:84%
IS REALLY ABOUT THE DEAL
THAT STANLEY KUBRICK MADE

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE MANAGER OF
THE OVERLOOK HOTEL -- AMERICA.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS DEAL WAS TO GET STANLEY
TO RE-CREATE --

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000 align:middle line:84%
IN OTHER WORDS, TO FAKE --
THE APOLLO MOON LANDINGS.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000 align:middle line:84%
DANNY REPRESENTS
THE ARTISTIC SIDE OF KUBRICK.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY
OF THE ARTISTIC REALIZATION

OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE LUNAR
LANDINGS NEEDED TO APPEAR,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000 align:middle line:84%
KUBRICK NEEDED
TO TRUST HIS ARTISTIC SIDE.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000 align:middle line:84%
ROOM 237
REPRESENTS THE FAKE LUNAR SET

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:90%
THAT STANLEY HAD TO CREATE

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:84%
TO MAKE THE LUNAR LANDINGS
APPEAR FACTUAL.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:84%
BUT REALLY ON THIS SET AND
IN THIS ROOM, NOTHING IS REAL.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000 align:middle line:84%
AS THE FILM WILL SOON REVEAL,
ROOM 237 HAS TO BE LIED ABOUT.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000 align:middle line:84%
IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD
AT ALL -- EVER.

NOTHING REAL
EVER HAPPENS IN ROOM 237.

WHEN DANNY OPENS UP THE DOOR
TO ROOM 237,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:84%
WE SEE THE TAG
ATTACHED TO THE KEY.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IF YOU JUST LOOK AT
THE CAPITAL LETTERS ON THE TAG,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT SAYS
"ROOM" -- R-O-O-M --

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN "N,"
AND THERE'S A SMALL "O."

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000 align:middle line:84%
WE DISCARD THE SMALL "O,"
WE'RE LEFT WITH R-O-O-M AND "N."

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET TWO WORDS
OUT OF IT,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THOSE TWO WORDS
ARE "MOON ROOM."

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000 align:middle line:84%
SO, HERE WE HAVE THE TAG
ATTACHED TO THE KEY.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000 align:middle line:90%
IT'S IN THE DOOR IN ROOM 237,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:84%
AND THE LETTERS ON THE TAG
COME OUT TO SAY "MOON ROOM."

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000 align:middle line:84%
IS THIS WHAT STANLEY
CALLED THE LUNAR SET?

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000 align:middle line:90%
REALLY?

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000 align:middle line:84%

MEANWHILE,
DANNY ENTERS THE SCENE,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000 align:middle line:84%
AND IT IS OBVIOUS
THAT SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000 align:middle line:90%
HAS PHYSICALLY HURT DANNY.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000 align:middle line:84%
THIS MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS
ALSO TORN HIS APOLLO 11 SWEATER.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000 align:middle line:84%
WENDY, HORRIFIED,
THINKS THAT JACK DID IT.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000 align:middle line:90%
AND IN A WAY, SHE IS RIGHT,

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE DANNY GOT HURT BECAUSE
OF THE DEAL THAT JACK CUT.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:84%
FRUSTRATED, JACK GOES TO THE BAR
LOCATED IN THE GOLD ROOM.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000 align:middle line:84%
OBVIOUSLY STRESSED,
JACK WHISPERS TO NO ONE

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I BELIEVE THIS SCENE OCCURS
BECAUSE AT FIRST KUBRICK

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000 align:middle line:84%
THOUGHT THAT DIRECTING
THE APOLLO 11

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:84%

WAS GOING TO BE A SEXY JOB.

STARTED OUT AS A SEXY PROJECT

IF I CAN EVER PROVE THIS,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%

MR. HALLORANN,
WHAT IS IN ROOM 237?
