00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And God made the beast
of the Earth after his kind,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and cattle after their kind, and
everything that creepeth upon

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.330 align:middle line:90%
the Earth after his kind--

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.430 align:middle line:90%
and God saw that it was good.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And God said, let us make man in
our image, after our likeness.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So God created man
in his own image,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:90%
male and female he created them.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Once man looked to
God and higher beings

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
to understand his
nature and origin.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
According to Genesis,
God created man and woman

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
from the dust of the Earth,
about 6,000 years ago.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But when man started to dig
in the dust of the Earth,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
he found bones and
implements that appeared

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:90%
to tell another story--

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:90%
evolution.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
These ideas were formulated
by Charles Darwin in his book,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:90%
"Origin of Species."

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:10%
In this book, Darwin did not
say much about human evolution,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:10%
only that much light would be
thrown on the origin of man

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:10%
and its history.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
This brief remark set off
a revolution in thought.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And by the 1870s, the
belief in the origin

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
of man by evolution
from ape-like ancestors

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.170 align:middle line:84%
had become dominant among
scientists and academics

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Western world.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
In the years following
the publication

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
of the "Origin of Species,"
various scientists

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
began drawing family trees
showing how the human species

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:90%
evolved from lower animals.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
This particular tree was drawn
by the German naturalist, Ernst

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Haeckel.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The only problem
with this picture

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
was that there was precious
little evidence to support it.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
At first, they had
only Neanderthal man

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:90%
to fill in the gaps.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Too human-like and too
recent to be a missing link.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But scientist committed
to Darwinian evolution

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
expected that fossils
of a genuine ape man,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
sufficiently ancient,
would soon be found.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Haeckel
commissioned this painting,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.950 align:middle line:84%
showing exactly how
he should appear.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
He called him Pithecanthropus
alalus, the speechless ape man.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And scientists were
not disappointed.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Fossils said to represent a
whole series of intermediates

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
were discovered over the
next several decades.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Here is the picture
that emerged.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.380 align:middle line:84%
In 1894, the Dutch
physician, Eugene Dubois,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
discovered a primitive skull
and thigh bone in Java.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Thus realizing that dream
of Haeckel's Pithecanthropus

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:90%
alalus.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Today, Java man along with
Peking Man and other specimens

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:90%
is known as Homo erectus.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Homo erectus is thought to
have lived from 1.6 million

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:90%
to 300,000 years ago.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.986 align:middle line:84%
Modern man, represented
by Cro-Magnon man,

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
is thought to have
first appeared

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:90%
about 40,000 years ago.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Neanderthal man, now
generally thought

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:84%
to be an offshoot from the
main line of human evolution,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
existed from 150,000
to 35,000 years ago.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
In the 1920s, a South
African scientist

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
found the first
specimen of the creature

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
now called Australopithecus,
a small erect ape-like being

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
thought to represent the
human lineage at two to three

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:90%
million years ago.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
In the 1950s, Lewis
and Mary Leakey

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
discovered Homo
habilis, an intermediate

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
between Australopithecus
and Homo erectus.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
According to the
current scenario,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
the initial stages of evolution
from Australopithecus to Homo

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:90%
erectus took place in Africa.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Homo erectus then left
Africa and spread widely

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
throughout the tropical
and temperate latitudes

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:90%
of the old world.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in this
broad region, it

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:84%
is believed Homo erectus
evolved into Homo sapiens.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens completely
replaced Homo erectus

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and moved on into the northern
regions of the old world.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
No more than 20,000
years ago, Homo sapiens

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
is thought to have
crossed into North America

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:90%
and populated the new world.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the standard
scenario of human evolution.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
But over the past 150
years, much evidence

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
has been discovered
that radically

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:90%
contradicts this picture.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
At all ages in this picture
of fossil history and even

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
earlier, scientists
have found evidence

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
for the presence
of Homo sapiens.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
What is this evidence?

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And why have so few
people have heard of it?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we
should understand

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that our whole picture
of man's prehistoric past

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
is based on four kinds of
physical evidence-- stone

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
tools, incised bones,
human skeletal remains,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and other artifacts.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
A stone tool like this one
from a site in Torralba, Spain

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:90%
may look like an ordinary rock.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But experts in
lithic technology can

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
identify the chipping
and fracturing

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:90%
as the product of human work.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
In a similar
fashion, experts can

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
tell the difference between
marks made by animal teeth

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and those made by flint
tools on fossil bones.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
This cut bone was found
at a Cro-Magnon site.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
This Co-Magnon skeleton
was unearthed in France

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:90%
during the 19th century.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Most paleoanthropologists
would not

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
expect such skeletons
of modern human type

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:90%
to be older than 40,000 years.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Scientists interested
in human prehistory

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:84%
also study artifacts, such as
paintings, statues, carvings,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and pottery, which they tend
to regard as very recent.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
But now let's investigate
the large body of evidence

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:84%
in these categories
that contradicts

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
the modern picture
of man's origins,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
starting with that
found in Europe.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
In the 1850s, Carlos
Ribeiro, the head

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Geological
Survey of Portugal,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
found these tools in the Miocene
strata of the Tagus River

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Valley near Lisbon.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
To get some idea
of the astounding

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
age of Ribeiro's discoveries,
let's look at a chart

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:90%
of the geological ages.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
The Miocene extends from
five to 25 million years ago.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:84%
At present, the most
primitive accepted stone tools

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:84%
all lie within the Pleistocene,
being at most two million years

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Tools of the type
discovered by Ribeiro

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
when Miocene formations
are generally

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
found in the upper Pleistocene
and are characteristic of fully

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
modern man.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.560 align:middle line:84%
At present, extinct apes
are the highest primates

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:90%
assigned to the Miocene.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Then what made Ribeiro's tools?

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Are they really artifacts or
are they products of nature?

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's compare a barrow's tool
with an accepted stone tool

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
made by Neanderthal man
in the late Pleistocene,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:90%
less than 100,000 years ago.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
On both, large
flakes were removed

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
in parallel,
something not likely

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to occur in the course of random
battering by natural forces.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The opposite sides of both
pieces display additional

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:84%
features typical of human
work, such as the bulb

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
of percussion--
caused by a single,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
directed blow that removed
the flake from a flint core,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
the striking platform--

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
the surface upon which
the blow was struck,

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
the eraillure-- a
small chip removed

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:90%
from the bulb of percussion.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
In every respect,
Ribeiro's Miocene tools

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:84%
resemble those
accepted by scientists

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:90%
as the product of human work.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Despite such evidence,
many scientists

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
resisted the conclusion that
human beings manufactured tools

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:90%
in the Miocene.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
At an International Congress
of Archeology and Anthropology

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
held in Lisbon in 1871, a
commission of scientists

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
was appointed to examine the
sites of Ribeiro's discoveries.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
One member of this commission,
the Italian geologist,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Jay Bellucci, found this
tool in Miocene strata.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:84%
All the scientist
present agreed it

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:84%
was identical to late
Pleistocene scraping tools.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:84%
This led some to claim that it
was indeed a late Pleistocene

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:84%
tool that had been washed into
a Miocene formation from above.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But the tool was
found firmly embedded

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
in the upper surface of
an overhanging section

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:90%
of the Miocene layers.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Stone tools, even older
than those of Portugal,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
were found by the abbaye
bourgeois at Tenay in France.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Many of the tools were found
embedded in undisturbed

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Oligocene formations.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And this indicates an age of
from 25 to 38 million years.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Especially noteworthy,
is the retouching

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.740 align:middle line:90%
on the edges of the implements.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
This retouching is confined
to one side of the working

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:90%
edge of the implement.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It is obvious that several
small flakes have been removed

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
in succession and
most are oriented

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
in the same general direction.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Such retouching is generally
regarded as a sure sign

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:90%
of intentional work.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:84%
The implements from
the Oligocene of today

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
display the same features
as this accepted scraper

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:84%
from an upper Pleistocene
site in France.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Here are more examples
of unifacially

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
retouched implements
from the Oligocene

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
at Tenay reproduced from 19th
century scientific journals.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
At another site near
Aurillac in southern France,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:84%
several scientists
recovered stone

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
implements from
Miocene formations

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:90%
during the 19th century.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
In 1905, the German
scientist, Max Verworn,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
sought to confirm
these discoveries

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
by conducting his own
excavations at Aurillac.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
He personally recovered
these implements

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:90%
from Miocene formations there.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Here, the cortex, or outer
surface, of the flint

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
has been removed
from the working

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
edges, which have been carefully
chipped to form a point.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, such
as Henri Breuil,

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
sought to prove the natural
origin of such implements.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
An excavation near
Clermont in France, Breuil

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
found specimens like
these with small chips

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
of flint lying close
to the parent blocks,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
apparently removed by
geological pressure.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Because this occurred
in an Eocene formation,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Breuil believed human work of
any kind could be ruled out.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
He was convinced
human beings could not

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
have existed from 38 to
55 million years ago.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:84%
On the basis of
this preconception,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
he concluded that all of the
flints resembling tools found

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
in the same Eocene
stratum had also

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
been formed by geological
pressure, including this one.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And this one.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Breuil said
that it was stupefying

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to find in an Eocene formation
an implement such as this,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
which he said looked exactly
like a late Pleistocene

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:90%
tool made by Homo sapiens.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:90%
But here is an important fact.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Specimens of this
level of sophistication

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
were not found with
the chips in place.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Just because geological pressure
might have produced effects

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:84%
like this does not mean it can
produce implements like this,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
complete with wear marks
in the appropriate places.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
It would thus appear that Breuil
found a genuine human artifact

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:90%
in an Eocene formation.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
On the coast of East
Anglia in England,

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Jay Reed More and
other researchers

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:84%
reported several
intriguing discoveries.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
This pointed piece of wood
was recovered from the Cromer

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Forest Bed in East Anglia.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:84%
The right end has been cut
off flat, as if by sawing.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:10%
The Cromer Forest
Bed formation dates

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:10%
to the latter part of
the early Pleistocene

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:10%
and is about one to
1.5 million years old.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Jay Reed More noted
that at one spot,

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
it seems that the
line of cutting

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
has been corrected, as is
often necessary when sawing.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
It is hard to see
how such sawing could

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
have been accomplished without
tools considered quite modern.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:10%
Another discovery was this
carved shell, presented in 1881

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:10%
by geologist Henry Stokes
to the British Association

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:10%
for the Advancement of Science.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.910 align:middle line:10%
It was recovered from the
Red Crag Formation, which is

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:10%
1.5 to two million years old.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:10%
It may be recalled that
according to standard opinion,

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:10%
human beings
capable of such work

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:10%
did not appear in Europe
before 40,000 years ago.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:10%
Below the Red Crag
Formation is a layer

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:10%
called the detritus bed lying
upon the Eocene London clay.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.120 align:middle line:10%
It is composed of
fossils and sediments

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:10%
from the Pliocene, Miocene,
and Oligocene periods.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Anything found here could
be anywhere from two to 38

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:90%
million years old.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Jay Reed More
recovered these bone

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:84%
implements from the Detritus
Bed below the Red Crag.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
The fractures that
formed the points

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
go across the natural
grain of the bone,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
indicating intentional work,
rather than natural breakage.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Also discovered in
the detritus bed

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
was this round
object characterized

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
by Henri Breuil, one of
Europe's leading experts

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
on prehistoric man, as a
sling stone, similar to those

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:90%
used recently in New Caledonia.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
The sling stone was
apparently fashioned

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
from a clay-like
substance and its surface

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:84%
shows many parallel
striations indicating shaping

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:90%
with some sort of implement.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:84%
If the current view of
human evolution is accepted,

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
it is difficult to explain what
sort of being might have made

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
this object at least two million
and perhaps as much as 38

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:90%
million years ago.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
In middle Miocene
marine formations

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
on the Northwest
coast of France,

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
the Abbaye de Lonay discovered
this bone from a halitherium--

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:90%
an extinct sea mammal.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:84%
It bears what appear to be the
cut marks of a sharp implement.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Similar markings are found
on this whale bone recovered

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
by Jean Cappellini from a
Pliocene formation in Italy.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
These cut marks are
distinct from those

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:90%
that might be made by teeth.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
A tooth scraping over
the surface of a bone

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
typically leaves a
u-shaped depression,

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
crushing rather than
cutting the bone.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
a sharp flint blade

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
would leave a narrow v-shaped
incision such as found

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:90%
on the bones in question.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
In his original report
published in the 1870s,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Cappellini provided
this magnified

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
cross section of a cut mark on
one of his fossil whale bones.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Cappellini methodology was
as sophisticated as that

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:90%
used by modern scientists.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Thus far, we have been
considering stone tools, cut

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
bones, and other artifacts that
indicate the presence of man

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:90%
in very ancient times.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
One might ask if there
are any human skeletal

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:90%
remains from the same period.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
In the year 1860 at Castenedolo,
Italy on the southern flanks

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Alps, G. Ragazzoni,
a professor of geology,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
discovered human fossils
in a hillside excavation

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of a
five-foot thick layer

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:90%
of blue Pliocene clay.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Ragazzoni carefully examined
the overlying layers

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and determined they
were undisturbed.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1880, the bones of a
fully human man and a child

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
were discovered some yards
away at the same depth.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Ragazzoni again inspected
the overlying layers

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:90%
and found them undisturbed.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
A short time later,
the bones of a woman

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
were found at a
slightly higher level.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
The overlying layers of
yellow sand and red clay

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:90%
were undisturbed.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
This ruled out the
possibility the bones may

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
have been introduced
into the Pliocene clay

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:90%
by burial from above.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
The reconstructed skull of
the woman is fully human

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and provides excellent
evidence for Homo sapiens

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
in northern Italy over
two million years ago.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:84%
According to modern theory,
present day Homo sapiens

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:84%
came into being only
40,000 years ago.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Leaving Europe we now
turn our attention

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to discoveries in other
parts of the world.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
In 1894, Dr. Fritz
Noetling, a paleontologist

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
with a Geological
Survey of India,

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
found this implement in the
Miocene formation in Burma.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Noetling commented
that if this tool were

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to be rejected as the product
of natural forces, then almost

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
all the recognized stone
tools from later periods

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:90%
should also be rejected.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
In the early part
of this century,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
some Argentine scientists
discovered stone tools

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
in the Pliocene
formation at Miramar

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
on the coast of Argentina,
just south of Buenos Aires.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:84%
The formation
contained the bones

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:84%
of typical Pliocene
mammals making it

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:90%
over two million years old.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But the Argentine
researcher, Antonio Romero,

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
insisted that the
formation was quite recent

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and that the Pliocene
animal bones had

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:90%
been washed in from elsewhere.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Carlos Ameghino however,
found in natural connection

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
the bones of the whole rear
leg of a Pliocene species

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
of toxodon an extinct
South American mammal.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is not likely
to have occurred simply

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
by the random
movement of the bones

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:90%
in the currents of streams.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:84%
If the bones really
belong together,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
that means that a Pliocene
animal died in that place

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and that the formation really is
two to five million years old,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
as are the stone
tools found there.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And here is a further
interesting fact.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Carlos Ameghino found
embedded in the toxodon femur,

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:90%
a stone arrowhead.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
More evidence for
the presence of

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:84%
technologically-sophisticated
human beings over two million

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:90%
years ago in Argentina.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
This fully-human skull
was discovered in 1896

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:84%
by workmen excavating a dry dock
in the harbor of Buenos Aires.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It was found in the
rudder pit of the dry dock

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
at a depth of about 35 feet
below the bottom of the river,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
just after the workmen broke
through a hard limestone-like

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:90%
layer of tosca.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
The sediments in which
the skull was found

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
are 1.5 to 2.5
million years old.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Some might object
that no scientist

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
was present at the moment
of discovery by the workmen.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But workmen also discovered
the Heidelberg jaw,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
which is fully accepted as
an example of Homo erectus

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
in the middle
Pleistocene of Europe.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
In the 1850s, miners
first panned for gold

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
in the gravels of
California rivers.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Later, they dug mine
shafts at places

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
like Table Mountain
in Tuolumne County

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
in order to get at the
gold-bearing gravels.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The gravels were originally
deposited in rivers

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
that flowed here
millions of years

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.696 align:middle line:84%
ago during the Miocene
period and earlier.

00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the Miocene,
volcanic eruptions

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
covered the entire
area with basalt.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, in more recent times,
rivers cut new valleys,

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
leaving formations like
Table Mountain with deposits

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:84%
of gold-bearing
gravel now buried

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:90%
beneath layers of basalt.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
In 1877, John H. Neale entered
the Montezuma mine shaft

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:90%
at Table Mountain.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:56.110 align:middle line:84%
He proceeded 1,400
to 1,500 feet inside.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Then at the working
end of the shaft,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
he discovered in the
undisturbed gold-bearing gravel

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
this mortar and pestle along
with several stone spearheads.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Neale testified
he saw no fissures

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
by which the objects could
have entered from above.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
The gold-bearing gravels
at Table Mountain

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
date at least to
the late Miocene

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the objects found
in them would be seven to nine

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:90%
million years old.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Some modern geologists say
the ancient river channels

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:90%
are from the Eocene period.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And could thus be as much
as 55 million years old.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Miners made similar discoveries
at dozens of nearby locations.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
This mortar and pestle
were found in 1861

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
in gold-bearing gravels
16 feet below the surface

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:90%
at Kincaid Flat.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
These turned up at
Gold Spring gulch.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And this, 200 feet inside
the Boston Tunnel Company

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:90%
mine at Table Mountain.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.330 align:middle line:84%
This interesting object
was found in 1864, 16 feet

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
below the surface in
gold-bearing gravel

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:90%
at Oregon Bar in Placer County.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
These examples, and many others,
were reported by J.D. Whitney,

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.030 align:middle line:84%
the state geologist
of California.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, some objected that
they were are hoaxes by miners.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But in 1869, Clarence D. King
of the US Geological Survey

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
discovered this pestle firmly
in place at Table Mountain.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It is shown alongside
a modern Indian pestle

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The American anthropologist,
W. H. Holmes,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.210 align:middle line:84%
rejected the California
finds, mainly

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
because they did not fit in
with his ideas about evolution.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The discovery of
Java man had put

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
an ape man in the
middle Pleistocene,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
so how could you have
advanced stone tool making

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:90%
men in the Miocene or Eocene?

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
According to Holmes, it was
completely out of the question.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, many scientists,
most of them evolutionists,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:84%
had discovered abundant
evidence for a human presence

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
in the Pliocene, Miocene,
and earlier periods.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But with the
discovery of Java man

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and later of Australopithecus,
this evidence

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:84%
disappeared from view,
mostly because it did not

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
fit into the newly-emerging
scenario of human evolution.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Today, practically no one hasn't
even heard of this evidence.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:10%
If you want to
find out about it,

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:10%
you have to dig into obscure
19th century journals

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:10%
in many different languages.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it is
possible to point out

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:84%
discrepancies in
the evidence that

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:84%
goes against the current
theory of human evolution.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:10%
But the evidence that is
said to support this theory

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:10%
is also full of discrepancies.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
First, let's consider Java man.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Since Dubois made his initial
discovery here at Trinil,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
scientists have made many more
finds at other sites in Java.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:84%
These fossils are
now categorized along

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
with the original Java
man as Homo erectus.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
In 1978, a standard
textbook gave the Java Homo

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
erectus fossils potassium argon
dates from 700,000 years to two

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:90%
million years ago.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
A chart in the book
lists 24 discoveries.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Of these, at least 18, or
75%, were found on the surface

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
or came from unknown
locations and are thus

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
unsuitable for
potassium argon dating.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:84%
14 were initially found
by native collectors.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And four were found at a
museum in Holland 30 years

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:84%
after their discovery
with no clue

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to the original
stratigraphic location.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.360 align:middle line:84%
The potassium argon method
does not date the bone itself,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:84%
but rather is used to test
the age of volcanic deposits.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Only if a fossil is found
beneath an undisturbed

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.510 align:middle line:84%
layer of volcanic
material, is it

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
possible to assign it a
date using this method.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Devastating criticism
could have been

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
brought to bear on
the Java man fossils

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:84%
because most were found
on the surface at poorly

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:84%
specified locations by
paid native collectors,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:84%
but no such criticism
was leveled.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Instead, scientists simply
dressed up this imperfect

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.900 align:middle line:84%
evidence with undeserved
potassium argon dates

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that allowed the fossils to be
easily fitted into the accepted

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:90%
outline of human evolution.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
This double standard in
the treatment of evidence

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:90%
is a general phenomenon.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider how this
process of selective acceptance

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and rejection of evidence
operates in a related field

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:84%
we have already
briefly touched upon--

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:90%
the peopling of the new world.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The view now being
vigorously defended

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
is that Homo sapiens
crossed over from Siberia

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:90%
not more than 20,000 years ago.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Yet scientists have
discovered a great deal

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of evidence suggesting a far
more ancient human presence

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:90%
in the new world.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Even though this evidence
is comparable in quality

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and quantity to
the evidence used

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
to support the dominant
view, it is rejected

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:90%
by establishment scientists.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
1899, Ernest Volk,

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
a collector for
the Peabody Museum

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of Natural History at Harvard
found a Homo sapien's femur

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
embedded in glacial
strata at Trenton, New.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Jersey the layer in
which the bone was found

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
is said by the New
Jersey Geological Survey

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:90%
to be about 107,000 years old.

This small statue found
at Nampa, Idaho in 1889,

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:84%
came from an encased well
shaft at a depth of 300 feet.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.640 align:middle line:84%
The level at which
it was found is now

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:84%
dated by the US
Geological Survey

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
as being between 300 and
two million years old.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
The Nampa image is comparable
to the famous Willendorf

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Venus, attributed to
Cro-Magnon man in Europe.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Man is not thought to have
made such works of art

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:90%
until 30,000 years ago.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the Venus
of Willendorf endure

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:90%
was found by a road workman.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
This coin-like
object was recovered

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.675 align:middle line:84%
at a depth of over 100 feet
from a well boring in Illinois.

00:26:08.675 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The Geological
Survey of Illinois

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.600 align:middle line:84%
states that the formation
in which it was found

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.330 align:middle line:84%
is from 200,000 to
400,000 years old.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.540 align:middle line:84%
The discovery was initially
reported by William E. Dubois

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:90%
of the Smithsonian Institution.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.365 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1960s, Louis Leakey
located an early man sight

00:26:28.365 --> 00:26:31.450 align:middle line:84%
at Calico in Southern
California with stone tools

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:84%
found in strata dated
at 200,000 years old.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:84%
In succeeding years,
thousands of implements

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.062 align:middle line:84%
have been recovered
from the Calico site,

00:26:39.062 --> 00:26:40.270 align:middle line:90%
including this beaked graver.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.725 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.725 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
If scientists are reluctant to
modify their view concerning

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:84%
man's entry in
the Americas, they

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:84%
are even more hesitant
to change their view

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that modern man first appeared
within the past 40,000 years

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and he borrowed from ape-like
ancestors originating

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:90%
in Africa.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Evolutionist pride themselves on
having done away with the idea

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
that man was created 10,000
years ago, but not much

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:90%
has changed.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:84%
The present dominant
view is that human beings

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of modern type still
can be dated back

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:90%
only a few thousand years.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Before that, there
was only primitive man

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:90%
fading off into ape-like life.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But this film confronts
us with abundant evidence

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that human beings
of modern type have

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.990 align:middle line:84%
existed for tens of millions
of years into the past,

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:84%
in geological ages
distant from our own.
