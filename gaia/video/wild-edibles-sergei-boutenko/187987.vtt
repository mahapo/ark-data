00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Get closer because
we're outdoors,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to project a lot, and
we're going to become fast

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:90%
friends today.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:90%
First of all, my name is Sergei.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying plants
for a very long time.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what makes
me credible to talk about this.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a botanist.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't claim to be.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I've just been doing
it a really long time.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
My family threw me into this is
the short version of the story.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
When I was just 13
years old, my mom

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.827 align:middle line:84%
decided to hike from Mexico
to Canada on the Pacific Crest

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:08.627 align:middle line:90%
Trail.

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And we had no business hiking.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
We'd never hiked more
than a day before.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They took me to a
Play It Again store,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
invested what
little money we had

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:90%
into really crappy backpacks.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And then mid-April
in 1998, we had

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:84%
a friend drop us off on the
Mexican border to start hiking.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.983 align:middle line:84%
As an adult, I realize
how crazy this is.

00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I was a kid, I
was, like, oh, I guess

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:90%
everybody's family does this.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
When you hike that
far, you obviously

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
can't pack all the food
on your back, right?

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So you have to make
arrangements beforehand

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to pack parcels of food
that you ship to yourself.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And then every time you pass
a little town, you resupply.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, we had no
experience hiking.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.307 align:middle line:84%
We sort of started
guessing, well,

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
how much food could five hungry
hikers really eat in a week?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the resupply points
were about a week apart.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said five, so it was my
mom, my dad, my sister, me,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and then my cousin from Russia
who came to visit us for a year

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
because my uncle wanted her to
get a full, rounded experience,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So for six months of that year,
we took her into the woods

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
to give her the
American experience.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:90%
But that's a different story.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
We get on the trail, and
within a few short days,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
we understand that our
calculations were off.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We just sort of figured, oh, how
many dates can you really eat?

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We allotted five dates
per person per day,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:90%
small bottle of olive oil.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
We were also raw food
vegans at the time,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.340 align:middle line:90%
so we had a lot to think about.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
A week into the trip, we
started running out of food.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.783 align:middle line:84%
So we have two more days left to
hike, and yet our food is gone.

00:02:48.783 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
How many people
have tried fasting

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
before, by a show
of hands, anybody?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not very fun, right?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:90%
You always think about food.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine fasting when you're
expending 4,000 calories a day.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Even less fun.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So we had a little
family meeting.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We had to either decide
whether we quit the trail

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and stop doing
this, or improvise.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And my mom's all
about improvisation,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:90%
so she got some input.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
We, the kids, were
like, well, let's quit.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
My mom's like, yeah,
let's not quit.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:84%
We picked up a little
book on wild edibles,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and we started just learning
about different plants.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
That was one of our little
solutions that we came up with.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
That first week
was really scary.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, we started
learning new plants.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
We used to test all
plants on my father

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't speak
English, and so my mom said

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
that if we lost him,
it wouldn't be as

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
big of an impact on the family.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:90%
That's Russian black humor.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Long story short,
we successfully

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
completed the trail.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, we were
eating 60% to 70% wild edibles

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.585 align:middle line:90%
by volume.

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to stretch
the food parcels that we

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
prepackaged and just
put a bunch of wild food

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:90%
in them, fill them up.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And so from a very early age,
I got to see that it's doable,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:90%
it's realistic.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Just like any new skill,
it's hard at first,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:90%
but you perpetually get better.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:84%
And so today is going
to be about perpetually

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.445 align:middle line:90%
getting better.

00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
really hope to accomplish

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
is that through
repetition, we're

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
just going to learn at
least three new plants.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's my goal for
today, that each one of you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
walks away knowing how to
identify at least three plants.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:90%
If you learn 10, great.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But let's keep the bar low
because my motto is always

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:90%
keep it simple, stupid.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's do 10 minutes
of theory because I

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
think that's important
in the parking lot.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the second part,
we'll go into the park,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
to Jefferson Park
right over there,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're just going to do
hands-on looking at plants,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
studying them, talking about
how you would eat them.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I propose that today, we're
not going to eat anything--

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in fact, maybe we can
make that agreement--

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
simply because I've been
here for about a month,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
exploring, and it's
not the cleanest park.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So in the interest of
keeping everybody safe,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
let's just look at plants,
let's talk about them,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
sniff them, but let's not
put them in our mouth.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Sound good?

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Promise?

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.845 align:middle line:90%
Pinky promise?

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is because outside

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of there being plants
that you shouldn't eat,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
human pollutants are actually
almost as big of a concern,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:90%
in fact, maybe more so--

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.685 align:middle line:84%
pesticides, herbicides, various
chemicals, railroad ties.

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
That's something we're
going to talk about as well.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So why is it important
to learn about plants?

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The main reason is because
it enriches our life.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It teaches us about
our environment.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that I recently
learned from Expand Yoga

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
because I started coming
here and doing more yoga.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's a whole
list of various benefits,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:84%
like, you get more limber,
and psychologically, you rest.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But also, I realized
that yoga teaches you

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
about your immediate
surroundings, right?

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So when Liz and Matt tell
us to get in Warrior II,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
if you've never done
Warrior II before,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
now you know you
can do Warrior II.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, well, reach
around and clasp your hands

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:90%
behind your back.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, holy moly, I
didn't know I could do that.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Now I have that as a skill.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It's in my repertoire.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So you've just
expanded your life

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
because now you know you
could squat down like this.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever needed to,
you could do it, right?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:84%
In that same sense,
plants do the same thing.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.717 align:middle line:84%
You go to the park, and
you're completely novice,

00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and it just looks like greenery.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:90%
You have no idea what it is.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you start crouching down,
you start slowly examining

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:84%
every tiny little
morsel, every plant,

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and your world gets
so much bigger.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You think the world is
huge because there's

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
seven continents, and
you can fly for 11 hours

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and end up in
Russia or wherever.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
How much bigger
is the world when

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you start looking at all
the little microcosms?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So to me, one of the biggest
benefits of wild edibles

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
is that it literally enriches
your life and makes it bigger.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And how fortuitous that Expand
Yoga is sponsoring this?

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like a symbiotic
relationship, almost.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.615 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out if our
worlds need expanding.

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I made some handouts.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Take one, pass it around.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to quiz you.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Remember college, anybody?

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Pop quiz.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
This right here is a
test that I came up with.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
It's in my book.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I have a wild edibles book.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Shameless plug.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple copies that
will be for sale afterwards.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
This is a test that's
going to help us figure out

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
how much we know about the
natural world versus how

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
much we know about the
technological modern world.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So when everybody gets it,
we're going to take it together.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I made this in 2012, so
some of the brand names

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:90%
are now becoming obsolete.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.233 align:middle line:84%
But let's start from
the left, the top left,

00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and let's just shout it out.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.195 align:middle line:90%
What's that first T?

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:13.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Twitter.

00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Twitter.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:90%
No cheating, by the way.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:90%
No looking at the bottom.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
How about the next one?

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Facebook.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Next one?

00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
This is where
everybody gets stumped.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Myspace.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Myspace.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.795 align:middle line:90%
>> How about the check mark?

00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Nike.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Next one?

00:08:30.108 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Apple.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> McDonald's.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> McDonald's.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Mercedes.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Lacoste.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Lacoste.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:90%
A French tennis brand, right?

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
Now it gets harder.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at the
names of the plants.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:90%
What's A?

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oak.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oak.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm impressed.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.521 align:middle line:90%
How about the next one?

00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:52.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Fir.

00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Fir, I like fir.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.402 align:middle line:90%
C?

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:57.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Clover.

00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:58.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorrel.

00:08:58.046 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> How many people say clover?

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand nice and high.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.506 align:middle line:90%
How many people say sorrel?

00:09:04.506 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:90%
It's sorrel.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.752 align:middle line:90%
All right, D.

00:09:08.752 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Maple.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Not maple.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Grape.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.096 align:middle line:90%
E.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:15.896 align:middle line:90%
>> I say maple.

00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Maple.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Maple seed pod or helicopter.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.582 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:19.582 --> 00:09:20.382 align:middle line:90%
F?

00:09:20.382 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> A Douglas fir cone.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Douglas fir cone.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
See how the voices
are kind of getting--

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.335 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, G?

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:30.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Christmas tree.

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I like it.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Christmas tree.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.797 align:middle line:90%
What type of Christmas tree?

00:09:32.797 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it a fir?

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a fir.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes, so fir tree.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.454 align:middle line:90%
H?

00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Aspen.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Watercress.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Aspen.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And I?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.956 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a maple.

00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Maple.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a maple.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you guys did
better than most,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
but we could still expand
our world a little bit more.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
The second handout is what
I call Sergei's Wild Edibles

00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Cheat Sheet.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically a
little printout I made.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a PDF.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And on the front, it has
nine of my favorite plants.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.073 align:middle line:84%
And on the back, it has some
nutritional data and stuff.

00:10:11.073 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to give
you the paper version which

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
you can laminate,
or you could use it

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and love it on
this hike, and then

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.353 align:middle line:84%
if you want to laminate it
later-- because I laminated

00:10:21.353 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:90%
this for Liz and Matt.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Present.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You can go to my
website, which is on here,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:90%
print this off for free.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Take it to the print
shop, get it laminated,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
stick it in your car
or your backpack.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.803 align:middle line:84%
And now you have a
little field guide.

00:10:34.803 --> 00:10:38.285 align:middle line:84%
All right, so there's some
major benefits to wild edibles,

00:10:38.285 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and I want to quickly
run through those

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.430 align:middle line:90%
as well as how to stay safe.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Benefit number one, free food.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
That's synonymous
with wild edibles.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
at it in-depth,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
food costs are
continuously rising.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Every year, they go up 3% to 5%.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote my book in 2013,
they were already expensive.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But in 2019, grocery
store food bills

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:90%
are even higher than before.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you want to eat
healthy, you go to Met Market

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:84%
or you got a co-op,
you can barely

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
get out of there for less
than 100 bucks, right?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
The food that we are going
to learn how to harvest

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and eat today is
significantly going

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
to reduce your monthly
expenditure on food.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So during the summer months,
May through November,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I can offset easily
40% of my food costs

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
just by harvesting food
out of my backyard.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't even have to go far.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.782 align:middle line:84%
Some people think,
oh, wild edibles, it's

00:11:34.782 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:90%
a big pain in the butt.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:90%
You've gotta get in your car.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You've gotta take an entire day
off of work, go somewhere far.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.378 align:middle line:84%
It's literally stuff that's
growing all around your house,

00:11:45.378 --> 00:11:47.170 align:middle line:84%
in a neighborhood park,
that kind of thing.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
So wild edibles equal free food.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Wild edibles are also healthier
for you as well as the planet.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So because these
plants are wild,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%
they're as nature intended.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:84%
They have longer
root systems that

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
can go down below
depleted topsoil

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:90%
and draw vital minerals.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And they also
often grow in soils

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:90%
that haven't been depleted.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Janice Schofield, an author
that I deeply respect,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
she also says that wild edibles
have stronger immune systems

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:90%
for the area where they grow.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
live in Tacoma, Washington,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and you harvest a
dandelion that also

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
lives in Tacoma, Washington,
you can boost your immune system

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:90%
in the local region.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, when you eat chips
or crackers from the store,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
they come in plastic,
triple-wrapped in plastic.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And the sole purpose of that
plastic is to be thrown away.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
That bothers me
every time I do it.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
use for that thing.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It's for cleanliness
and to be thrown away.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
When you eat plants,
anything that's left over

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:84%
goes in your compost,
turns into soil.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It reduces waste.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So healthier for
you and the planet.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Benefit number three is
the epitome of local food.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
The average food,
the average produce

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
travels roughly
about 2,500 miles

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to get from where it's
grown to your plate.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
A dandelion grows
in your backyard.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So literally, you walk
out the back door,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and that's textbook local food.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:90%
So less of a carbon footprint.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:90%
It also diversifies your food.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Michael Pollan, in his
book, "In Defense of Food,"

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
writes that hundreds
of years ago, we

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
used to eat up to 80,000
different species of things.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
species, I'm not just

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%
talking about,
like, elk and deer.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Different plants.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of different plants.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of different
nuts, and seeds, and grains.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And then over time, that's
reduced, reduced, reduced to

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:84%
roughly, he says
3,000, I actually

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:90%
think it's closer to 300.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So we think we live this
diverse life where one day, we

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
have Italian food, then
we have Mexican food,

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:90%
then we have Russian food.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And really, all we're eating is
wheat, corn, corn byproducts,

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.948 align:middle line:84%
rice, sugar, and a
few different things.

00:14:02.948 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think it's important
to have a diverse diet?

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Anyone?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So diversity is important
because all food is comprised

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:90%
of different micronutrients.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And the more diversity we get
in our diet, the more likely

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.135 align:middle line:84%
we are to meet all of our
recommended daily allowances.

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So we eat some miner's
lettuce, it gives us

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
some vitamin C.
We eat some kale,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
it gives us some protein
and some other minerals,

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And when we eat a very diverse
diet, our bodies get enough.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that
the first person that

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.140 align:middle line:84%
coined the phrase
"eat a balanced diet,"

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
he or she probably pointed
at everything and said,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:84%
here's some lakes, eat some
food from there, some algaes.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Here's the ocean, eat some
more seaweed from there.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Eat some pine nuts
from the mountains.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Eat a diverse, balanced diet.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So wild edibles will help
us expand our food options

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:90%
exponentially.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:84%
They also prepare us
for unfortunate events.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Should a disaster
ever happen, you'll

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:90%
actually know what to eat.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And two other benefits that
are worth mentioning is, A,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:84%
they're going to help you
bond and make memories

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
with your friends and family.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:90%
It's really important.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever cooked
a meal together?

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:90%
You laugh.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:90%
You play.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine going outside,
and harvesting the food,

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:90%
and then making the meal.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:90%
It just adds another layer.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we're
all here, outside,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and more of
a commodity these days.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:90%
We're standing.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:84%
We're getting vitamin
D. Probably a little bit

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
too much for our
liking at the moment,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
but we're getting
vitamin D from the sun.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:90%
We're breathing in fresh air.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to crouch,
and we're going to dig,

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to lead to
a benefit we call exercise.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
That's my spiel.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.283 align:middle line:84%
I could talk more
on this, but I think

00:15:57.283 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:84%
we should just get it,
start talking about plants.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
A little warning, we're going
to be very repetitive today,

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and I do that systematically
because I want you to remember.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
One of my wild edibles teachers,
she actually lives in Issaquah.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.735 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Karen Sherwood
of EarthWalk Northwest.

00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
lessons I took away from her,

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:84%
is that if you are repetitive,
you strengthen a muscle,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll remember it
for the rest of your life.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we're going
to remember a lot of plants.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:90%
On that note, let's go.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
This is the only one I found.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I've been coming to this
park for about a month now,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
every couple days.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the only wild
sweet pea that I found.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
controversial plant.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.658 align:middle line:84%
So at every wild edibles
class I've ever done,

00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
somebody's always like, but
what about the guy in "Into

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:90%
the Wild"?

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:84%
He supposedly died
from eating sweet peas,

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.617 align:middle line:90%
a version of this plant.

00:16:54.617 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
want to say about that

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:84%
is that story is
very inaccurate.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:84%
You read the book,
it says one thing.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.222 align:middle line:84%
You watch the movie, it's a
completely different story.

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Jon Krakauer has been criticized
heavily for a lot of his books,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
but "Into the Wild" is
probably the biggest criticism

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:90%
he's received.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:84%
There's an author, his name is
Samuel Thayer, really awesome

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:90%
dude, a forager I respect.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:84%
In his book,
"Nature's Garden," he

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
has a great account of "Into
the Wild," the true story.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what ended up
happening is Chris McCandless,

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%
he starved to death.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.880 align:middle line:84%
That was what the
coroner determined.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't a very good story
because this kid going out

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
into the woods, and
for many, many months,

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
not getting enough calories, and
then starving to death, well,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:90%
how are you going to sell that?

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a much more
interesting story

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to sell this scary fable
about how he just ate a plant,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:90%
and it killed him.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So he supposedly mistook wild
sweet pea for wild potato.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
After he died, both wild
sweet peas and wild potatoes

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:84%
were studied extensively,
and neither of the plants

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.773 align:middle line:90%
were found to be poisonous.

00:18:02.773 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the botanists
that studied the plant

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
said that "I would
eat both plants."

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
lovely, tasty plant.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It tastes just
like a bean sprout.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And it grows all over.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:90%
It develops purple flowers.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they're yellow.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Kind of looks like a house pea.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a vine, right?

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Today, a lot of what
we're going to be doing

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.258 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to say,
please describe it to me,

00:18:28.258 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:90%
please describe it to me.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So just take it, take
a look, pass it around.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Take one, pass it around.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.723 align:middle line:90%
So what does it look like?

00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:46.192 align:middle line:90%
>> It looks like a sweet pea.

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It looks like a sweet pea.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.885 align:middle line:84%
I need more
information than that.

00:18:48.885 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It has rabbit
ears for leaves.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, rabbit ears for leaves.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, curly
cues and tendrils.

00:18:53.965 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Ah, I like curly
cues and tendrils.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So initially, when you go
out, and you look for plants,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
they all look green, and
it's hard to differentiate

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get
scared, because we're like,

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, how do I learn
what a sweet pea is

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:90%
versus a sweet potato?

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.558 align:middle line:84%
He learned about
it in the same way

00:19:12.558 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that you learn how to identify
a cabbage versus a head

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:90%
of iceberg lettuce.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Our brains have
folders in our heads,

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and the folders just
start storing information.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And that information is
called a search image.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.745 align:middle line:84%
So when you're very
young, you probably

00:19:27.745 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
didn't know the difference
between a lemon and an orange,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Your parents could show
you a lemon and an orange,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
you'd be like, I don't
know, they both look round,

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:90%
and they both have a skin.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, as
you came in contact

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
with lemons and oranges,
you started differentiating

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.345 align:middle line:90%
one and the other.

00:19:44.345 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is
going to happen

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:90%
when we talk about plants.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, what
does it look like?

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And somebody says,
oh, it has tendrils,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.690 align:middle line:84%
that's a very good identifying
characteristic that's

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
going to help you
recognize the plant.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're improving
our search image.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
a plant long enough,

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:90%
the folder gets really full.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And then for the
rest of your life,

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
you'll know this is
a wild sweet pea.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
The sweet pea also teaches us
something called meristems.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And meristems are the
growing parts of plants.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:90%
So when a plant is growing--

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:84%
"meristem" actually comes from
the Greek term "to divide."

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So when cells divide
and split apart,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
those are called
meristematic parts.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So when a plant is
young, it's light green,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and it's very flexible.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:90%
It's full of sugars.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It's full of minerals
and vitamins.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it's most
nutritious and most delicious.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
As the plant gets
taller or longer,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
the plant cannot support
itself if it's all flexible.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So it starts developing a
solid foundation, very fibrous.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel this
plant, the bottom

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
is very stiff
compared to the top.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:90%
So this part is meristematic.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Like the tops of
asparagus, for example.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
You can snap them off.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:90%
They're very flexible.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:90%
They're very delicious.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But you go down
the stem, and it's

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:90%
very fibrous, not as delicious.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So as foragers,
we're going to want

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to look for the tops,
the meristematic bits.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So on the wild sweet pea,
in addition to the flower,

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:84%
the meristematic part is
this tender little bit.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.190 align:middle line:90%
On we go.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.792 align:middle line:90%
My gift to you.

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:22.776 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh?

00:21:22.776 --> 00:21:23.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Sergei?

00:21:23.576 --> 00:21:24.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Sergei, yeah.

00:21:24.432 --> 00:21:25.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Sergei.

00:21:25.232 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:90%
So the whole plant is edible?

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.275 align:middle line:84%
>> So the whole plant
is edible, but--

00:21:29.275 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>> The top part, everything?

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
talk about that.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very objective.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:90%
While you can eat this part--

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> How hungry are you?

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> How hungry are you?

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.115 align:middle line:84%
More often than not,
I just go through,

00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and I'd harvest a
small bowl of those.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.132 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'd
throw on a salad.

00:21:44.132 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, on we go.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
My friends get sick of this
because they'll take me out

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
on a hike, and I'm
like, oh, oh, oh.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, five things
to talk about right here.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing that I want
to talk about, which most of us

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:90%
already know, is grass.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Grass is a plant that most
people can already identify.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of different
varieties of grass.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, it's probably
the best survival food

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.830 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
knows what grass is.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.872 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to miss.

00:22:21.872 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
There's some sedges and stuff
that kind of look like grass,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%
but more often than not, people
know what grass looks like.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Grass has all the
vitamins and minerals

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
necessary to maintain
proper body function, which

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:84%
means that if your car ever
gets stuck in the forest,

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know what else
to do, you're really hungry,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:90%
grass will sustain you.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.912 align:middle line:90%
Now we're not cattle.

00:22:40.912 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:90%
We don't have seven stomachs.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to digest.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But again, if we look for
the meristematic bits,

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
the light green parts,
they're kind of chewy.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:90%
And here-- hold on.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I do this on
camera, it never works, but--

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.610 align:middle line:90%
boom, bam.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So maybe let's all try this.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's all come over here,
and just pull on the top,

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and try and expose
this light green part.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So grass is kind
of a tube, right?

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you pull at just the
right place, you can expose--

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.630 align:middle line:84%
you hear like a little
squeak, like a whoop.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:27.896 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.896 --> 00:23:29.824 align:middle line:90%
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:34.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we were
hiking on the trail,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.092 align:middle line:84%
for example, one
thing I would do,

00:23:37.092 --> 00:23:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I would get ahead of my
family because I was walking,

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm the fastest.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I was a 13-year-old boy and
had a lot of energy to expend.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would just walk
all day, and I'd--

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:90%
[CRUNCH] And throw it away.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.720 align:middle line:90%
[CRUNCH] Throw it away.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So by the end of
the day, maybe I

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:90%
had a thousand pieces of grass.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And this part is
actually quite delicious.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's that meristematic,
asparagus-like part.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
thing that accomplishes

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
is because nature is very wise,
so when I harvest this, eat

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
this little bit, and
then throw the grass,

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm planting more grass.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a symbiotic relationship.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Ann Wigmore.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody heard the
name Ann Wigmore before?

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
She's the lady that
popularized wheat grass.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So she was a Lithuanian
woman who had

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of health problems.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And the medical
industry basically

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:90%
said we can't help you.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.272 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed that her cat
was sitting and eating grass

00:24:27.272 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
every time it was sick, and
then it would get better.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So Ann Wigmore
started eating grass,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and her health problems
started going away.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.322 align:middle line:84%
And she was the lady that
pioneered wheatgrass.

00:24:37.322 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So now you go to
the store, and you

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
pay $4 for a little
shot of wheatgrass,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:90%
it's because of her.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But I have a little
secret for you.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:84%
You could just juice the grass
in your yard, and then save $4.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.254 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:24:51.254 --> 00:24:52.468 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same quality?

00:24:52.468 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same exact quality.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing special
about wheatgrass other

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:90%
than it grows the fastest.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I used to grow wheatgrass
for a health institute.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And a certain red,
hard wheat just

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
produces the most
grass the quickest.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's lots of
other wild grasses

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that are more
nutritious than that.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're going to
juice grass or blend it

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:84%
in a smoothie, you have
to ensure that it hasn't

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:90%
been sprayed with pesticides.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So in my own backyard,
I know for two years,

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:90%
we haven't been spraying it.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely throw that
in a green smoothie or juice it.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't go, necessarily,
to a park to do it.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:84%
The next plant is right over
here that I want to talk about.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.114 align:middle line:90%
Anybody know what this is?

00:25:41.114 --> 00:25:42.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Thistle?

00:25:42.022 --> 00:25:43.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it milkweed?

00:25:43.384 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Dandelion things?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I like where you're going.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.530 align:middle line:90%
You guys are not wrong.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:90%
So this is called sow thistle.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And I already knows what
this looks like, so why don't

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:90%
you guys pass it around?

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Sow thistle is in the
same family as dandelion,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.830 align:middle line:90%
which is the sunflower family.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's essentially
the root of lettuce.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So thousands of years ago,
when lettuce didn't exist,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:84%
people just ate dandelions
and sow thistle.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever
chewed on dandelion,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:90%
you know that it's very bitter.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
My guess is how we got
lettuce from dandelions

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
is people got really sick
of that bitter taste,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and so they started looking
for varieties of dandelion that

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:90%
were less bitter.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And once they
found that variety,

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:84%
they started waiting for
that variety to go to seed,

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
growing those seeds, and then
again choosing selectively

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
the least bitter variety
and growing those seeds.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And over time, we
have Romaine lettuce,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
which almost looks
nothing like dandelion,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
but it's in the same family.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So both sow thistle and
dandelion are extremely

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:90%
good for our inner organs.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:84%
The bitterness, the white milky
sap, which some people say

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:84%
is not good to eat--
that's pure BS.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:84%
That bitterness
is actually really

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%
good for cleansing
our gallbladder,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.390 align:middle line:84%
our pancreas, our kidneys,
and it also aids digestion.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
We need bitters to help produce
saliva and bile in our stomach,

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:90%
and it helps digest food.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, now that we
eat donuts, and cheesecake,

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff, bitter
just doesn't compete.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So we throw the
dandelions away, or we

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:84%
complain that they're
weeds, when in fact, we

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
should be eating more of this
and throwing the donut away.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.608 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way
to eat dandelions

00:27:21.608 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is to blend them in
a green smoothie.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when you blend
sweet with bitter,

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the sweetness
counteracts the bitter.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.937 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing
that's good to do with them

00:27:29.937 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:90%
is put them in a pesto.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So you make pesto
with pine nuts,

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.783 align:middle line:84%
a little Parmesan, basil,
just cut out the basil

00:27:35.783 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and throw the
dandelions in there.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the sweet and-- oh,
sorry-- the salty and bitter,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.413 align:middle line:90%
it tastes delicious.

00:27:42.413 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's keep going.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.580 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Sergei.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh?

00:27:54.932 --> 00:27:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you going to
talk about oxalates?

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for bringing that up.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:90%
What was your name?

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Jenny.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Jenny.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:04.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:04.635 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you, Jenny.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you too.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Craig.

00:28:06.507 --> 00:28:07.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Craig.

00:28:07.307 --> 00:28:08.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:08.261 --> 00:28:09.693 align:middle line:90%
And how about dandelion roots?

00:28:09.693 --> 00:28:10.735 align:middle line:90%
They seem so substantial.

00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Can you cook them?

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's talk about it.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.612 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's address dandelions.

00:28:15.612 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I had two questions.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Number one, oxalates.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:84%
There's two ways to
think about plants.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Number one, there's the
botanist, toxicology

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:84%
perspective, which is, is
this plant poisonous or edible

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:90%
based on its chemical buildup?

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at that,
almost everything is poisonous.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you read a book
about toxicology,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
you find that things
like mint are poisonous.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Dandelions have certain
alkaloids or oxalates in them

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:47.583 align:middle line:84%
that are poisonous,
in large quantities.

00:28:47.583 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And the second
perspective is more

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the Native American perspective
where nothing is poisonous,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
it's all about dosage, certain
parts that you can eat,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and the time of year
that you can eat it.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I tend to side more with the
Native American perspective

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
because all the research that
I've done points that that

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:90%
is the right direction.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:90%
So oxalates.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
All greens have some trace
amounts of either alkaloids,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:90%
oxalates, or anti-nutrients.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a mechanism to
preserve the plant.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So the plant doesn't want
you to only eat kale,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
because if we only ate
kale, kale would go extinct.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:90%
So kale tells you this.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It says, you can eat me, but
if you eat 10 buckets of me,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have some signs
of less than perfect health.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a stomach ache.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're going to
get a little hives.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.847 align:middle line:84%
Some relatively minor issues
that we would like to avoid,

00:29:39.847 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless, it's
not going to kill you.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:84%
My mom, Victoria
Boutenko, she came up

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.280 align:middle line:84%
with the concept
of green smoothies

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and popularized them
through her books.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And people loved
it for 10 years.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And then all of this,
don't eat kale and spinach

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.290 align:middle line:84%
because it has oxalates
stuff started coming around,

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
because people supposedly
would get gallstones

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:90%
from that, right?

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
The trouble with that theory
is that chocolate, beer, wheat,

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of other stuff
have oxalates in them too,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and nobody is saying don't
eat chocolate, wheat,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:84%
or beer, at least not
at the local brewery.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's the green smoothie
that gives you the gallstones,

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.675 align:middle line:84%
So I have many resources
online about this subject

00:30:20.675 --> 00:30:21.475 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:30:21.475 --> 00:30:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I actually have a YouTube video.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm on YouTube prevalently.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's a non-issue
if you eat a diverse diet.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
If you were to eat buckets of
kale every single day, again,

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:84%
you might run into
some problems.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.450 align:middle line:84%
If you rotate your greens,
if you rotate the food

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that you eat, it's not an
issue because those oxalates

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:84%
will get eradicated through
your kidneys and liver.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a big deal.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Now if you were
to eat seasonally,

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.200 align:middle line:84%
this would be even
less of an issue

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.227 align:middle line:84%
because in the
springtime, you're

00:30:52.227 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:90%
going to eat lots of dandelions.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Then dandelions go away, you're
going to eat something else.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But because we've, quote,
unquote, "improved" life, where

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:84%
now we have kale all year
round at the grocery store,

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.150 align:middle line:90%
it's more of an issue.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:84%
The second question was,
do you eat things cooked?

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Wild edibles, you're
going to cram them

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:90%
in your diet every which way.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.342 align:middle line:84%
You can throw them
in salads, and I'll

00:31:18.342 --> 00:31:20.800 align:middle line:84%
spotlight some of the things
that you could do with salads.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Put these in
smoothies, juice them.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.320 align:middle line:84%
You can also put them on your
pizzas and saute them up.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Throw them in soups.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Get them into your
diet as best as you can

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.600 align:middle line:90%
because these are superfoods.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And these are supplements that
you don't have to pay for.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:84%
One of my rants on
supplements is that it's

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:90%
kind of controversial.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't
like that I say this,

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
but I've never
taken supplements.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I've tried many times, but I've
found that there's no effect.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Supplements, first, are
sold on a fear-based scheme.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:84%
The nutrients that are
around is not enough.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:84%
If you just eat organic food,
you'll never be healthy.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
That's how that
supplement story starts.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And then you're like, oh, no.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Man, even if I
shop at Whole Foods

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and buy the best
ingredients that I can buy,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.552 align:middle line:90%
I still don't get enough?

00:32:08.552 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should get
your supplement.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:84%
You take the best supplement,
the best, most expensive

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.810 align:middle line:84%
supplement, you twirl it around
and read on the ingredients

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.663 align:middle line:90%
list, and what is it made of?

00:32:19.663 --> 00:32:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Corn.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.233 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
it's like rice protein

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:90%
with some of the good stuff.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Like 90% rice, 10%
everything else.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a really
high quality supplement,

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
it's made out of
fresh, organic produce.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So please explain to me how
if lettuce doesn't have enough

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
of what I need, but
the supplement that I'm

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.138 align:middle line:84%
buying from you is
made from lettuce,

00:32:42.138 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:90%
how does that make sense?

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
this plant right here.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Everybody grab one.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:56.000 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:84%
When we harvest plants,
I encourage everybody

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:90%
to engage all of their senses.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.990 align:middle line:84%
We have five senses
because each one of those

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.570 align:middle line:84%
is a different form
of communication.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those senses is
meant to help keep us safe.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, when people
get poisoned from eating

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:84%
stuff they're not supposed to,
it's because they just like--

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.630 align:middle line:84%
[CRUNCH] And they
only engage one sense.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.413 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's four other
tests that you failed to do.

00:33:27.413 --> 00:33:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing on
that that I want to say

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
is that wild plants
are not dangerous.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.330 align:middle line:84%
The only way that you
would get poisoned

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:84%
is if you're just going
through the woods,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and you just start
eating stuff before you

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:90%
identify what they are.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.310 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.885 align:middle line:84%
There's no bad dandelion
sitting in an alley,

00:33:42.885 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:84%
waiting for you to
walk down that alley

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.390 align:middle line:84%
so they can jump
down your throat.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So number one, if you
can resist the temptation

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.690 align:middle line:84%
to just eat foreign foods,
you'll always be safe.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Then we engage our senses.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So we put all plants through
five different tests.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:90%
First, what does it look like?

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.060 align:middle line:90%
So what does this look like?

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Chamomile.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of like chamomile.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You're a professional.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It smells like chamomile.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.199 align:middle line:90%
>> So it looks like chamomile.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So already, it's
telling us, hey,

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:84%
this looks like a familiar food
that I'm accustomed to eating.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.325 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good point.

00:34:16.325 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you brought that up.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.545 align:middle line:84%
The next test is, what
does it feel like?

00:34:21.545 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's soft.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.139 align:middle line:90%
>> It's soft.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't conceivably eat
this because it feels soft.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:84%
If I were to try and eat
that telephone pole--

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:84%
maybe my eyes
would get confused,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.489 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they would,
but if my eyes got confused,

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd feel it, and my hands would
tell me what my eyes missed.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.110 align:middle line:90%
This is really hard.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:84%
I'd break my teeth
if I would eat it.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.249 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:47.120 align:middle line:84%
This little plant has now
passed the looking test

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.070 align:middle line:90%
and the feeling test.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.699 align:middle line:90%
Now what does it smell like?

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:50.819 align:middle line:90%
>> It smells really good.

00:34:50.819 --> 00:34:51.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Fresh.

00:34:51.619 --> 00:34:53.827 align:middle line:84%
>> If you smash the flower,
it smells like pineapple.

00:34:53.827 --> 00:34:56.925 align:middle line:84%
>> If you smash the flower,
it smells like pineapple.

00:34:56.925 --> 00:34:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad you're
bringing this up

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:84%
because this is
called pineapple weed,

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.833 align:middle line:90%
and it's a wild chamomile.

00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it does.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> So look at that.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.900 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
learn about plants.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:90%
So it looks like chamomile.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, lots of plants
look like chamomile.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.460 align:middle line:90%
We feel it.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It feels soft.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.000 align:middle line:90%
We smell it.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wow, it smells
like pineapple.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So now we just learned,
looks like chamomile,

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:90%
smells like pineapple.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are really good
identifying characteristics.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.540 align:middle line:90%
So we have two more senses.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:90%
What does it sound like?

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.747 align:middle line:84%
In Native American
lore, you would actually

00:35:32.747 --> 00:35:34.830 align:middle line:84%
talk to the plant, and it
would talk to you, which

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:90%
is a quality that I've lost.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But I interpret that sense to be
like, what does the environment

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.480 align:middle line:90%
sound like?

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:90%
I hear somebody mowing.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Is somebody spraying chemicals?

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Is there a big roadway nearby?

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything and is there
any sound that might jeopardize

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.360 align:middle line:90%
the edibility of this plant?

00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the very last test
is, what does it taste like?

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not just
going to grab a bunch of it

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, and just
put it in your mouth, and go,

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:08.615 align:middle line:90%
I hope it tastes good.

00:36:08.615 --> 00:36:10.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
approach it cautiously,

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
just eat a little bit,

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and then you're going to wait.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And then if you do
this cautiously,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and over time, you'll
understand, oh, chamomile.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Wild chamomile,
a.k.a., pineapple weed.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.170 align:middle line:84%
If you dry this, it
makes a really good tea.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Chamomile has
calming properties.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:84%
If you have any sort of
allergic stuff going on

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:84%
because of the seasons or food
allergies, it'll soothe those.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps
to improve sleep.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So what I would do, I would
actually throw these flowers

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:90%
and tender leaves into salad.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I would saute them, put them
on an omelet, if you will.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Throw them in soups.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.376 align:middle line:84%
Or just dry the leaves and
make a tea out of them.

00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you did do that,
if you put it on a salad,

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.320 align:middle line:84%
how many of these would
you do without being--

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so if that was my very
first time eating this plant--

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I would just put a
handful on it, right?

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And then just see what happens.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Put a handful?

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> A handful is fine.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people get
nervous about wild edibles

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:84%
because they think, oh,
if I misidentify it,

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:90%
the consequences are huge.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.670 align:middle line:84%
But the consequences,
most of the time,

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.740 align:middle line:84%
are relatively
insignificant, like you

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.650 align:middle line:84%
might get a little bit
of a stomach upset.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:84%
That being said, we want to
eliminate as many variables

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and consequences as possible,
so we approach new food

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:84%
cautiously, and then we
eliminate those variables.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, actually, on
that sheet that I gave you,

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I have Sergei's
Rules for Foraging,

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's three simple rules.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Number one, don't eat something
if you don't know what it is.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Kind of common sense.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people actually
disregard that, surprisingly.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.793 align:middle line:84%
I get emails all the
time, people say,

00:37:50.793 --> 00:37:52.960 align:middle line:84%
my kids and I went out, and
we harvested this plant.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.085 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what it is?

00:37:54.085 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:90%
We ate a bunch of it.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So I actually made a rap
song that's on YouTube,

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.118 align:middle line:84%
called, "Don't Eat Something
if You Don't Know What It Is,"

00:38:01.118 --> 00:38:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that plays around with
how silly that can be.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:84%
The second rule is eat new
foods in small amounts.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So maybe when you're young,
everything is foreign to you,

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and your parents
are very cautious.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, what happens when
he eats sweet potatoes?

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.290 align:middle line:90%
He's good.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
he eats lettuce?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.823 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's fine.

00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe you
get to peanuts,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and your parents figure out
pretty quickly, oh, peanuts

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.670 align:middle line:90%
don't do so well for him.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So you learn at a young
age what you're allergic to

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.107 align:middle line:90%
and what you're not allergic to.

00:38:36.107 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the interest
of staying safe,

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that's essentially what
you're doing when you're

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:90%
playing around with new plants.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to approach
all new plants as though you're

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.400 align:middle line:90%
potentially allergic to them.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.237 align:middle line:84%
So even though Sergei says
pineapple weed is 100% edible,

00:38:50.237 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the first time you
eat pineapple weed,

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you're just going
to eat a little bit.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And then rule number three
is you don't mix plants.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Because if I made a salad
with 15 new wild edibles,

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and then I had an
allergic reaction,

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:06.553 align:middle line:84%
it'd be very hard to weed
out what caused it, right?

00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:07.720 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's keep going.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.875 align:middle line:84%
So real quick, what do
you guys see right now

00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:90%
when you look at this park?

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.047 align:middle line:84%
What's the first thing
that comes to mind?

00:39:25.047 --> 00:39:25.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Grass.

00:39:25.444 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Dandelions.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Grass.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Dandelions.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Dogs walking.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Dogs walking.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I like all those things.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Because look, you
already just altered

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.180 align:middle line:90%
your world a little bit.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.828 align:middle line:84%
Maybe before this started, you
would have just seen a park.

00:39:36.828 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Now I already heard two
different edibles-- grass

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and dandelions.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And three, I love that
you said "dogs walking,"

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's a really
good thing to consider.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Hey, there's animals.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a high trafficked area.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:49.747 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:39:49.747 --> 00:39:51.080 align:middle line:90%
One more thing about dandelions.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:84%
These things are really
edible, and they're delicious,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:90%
the little flowers.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.673 align:middle line:84%
So when you're at home, I invite
you to-- this is your homework.

00:39:59.673 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Just take one of these flowers,
and plop it in your mouth,

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:02.890 align:middle line:90%
chew it up.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that
it's very sweet.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Kind of has a pleasant,
green, kale-like taste.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:84%
These things concentrate
vitamin D. And guess what?

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.950 align:middle line:84%
In areas where we lack it
many months out of the year,

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.320 align:middle line:84%
this is a really good
thing to put in your diet.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Now how do you eat it?

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Flower fritters.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.450 align:middle line:84%
You can fry them up in a
little bit of oil and batter.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:84%
You can also take these
and stick them in honey,

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and the honey will just
concentrate, preserve them,

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So you make a
dandelion-infused jam.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:36.560 align:middle line:84%
You can throw them
on salads raw.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.620 align:middle line:90%
You can throw them in soups.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.040 align:middle line:84%
One thing I like to do sometimes
is actually take the petals out

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.440 align:middle line:84%
of it, put them in an ice
cube tray, fill it with water,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.240 align:middle line:90%
freeze them.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Now you have flower
petal-infused ice.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the summer, you
drink, it looks beautiful.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to go
into the shade over there,

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:84%
get a little reprieve from the
sun and talk about some plants.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it necessary
to wash those?

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it necessary to wash that?

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:03.620 align:middle line:90%
You want to wash stuff.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Just asking.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I like it.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.947 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounded like you
just throw it right in.

00:41:07.947 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, there's been a few
follow ups about dandelion.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:84%
One is about the roots,
and one about the leaves.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can't get both
here, so we'll do some digging.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:21.398 align:middle line:90%


00:41:21.398 --> 00:41:22.250 align:middle line:90%
And careful.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.673 align:middle line:90%
There's blackberries.

00:41:23.673 --> 00:41:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.940 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Number one, if you can find
a dandelion-- actually,

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd love everybody to grab a
leaf of dandelion if you can.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:46.215 align:middle line:90%


00:41:46.215 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, everybody has a
dandelion leaf, right?

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.913 align:middle line:84%
Here's a test to identify
a true dandelion.

00:41:50.913 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going to flip
it over, and you're

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.513 align:middle line:84%
going to run your finger
along the main vein.

00:41:54.513 --> 00:41:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you feel.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Smooth.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Smooth.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Fuzz on leaf.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Fuzz?

00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Fuzzy.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it should be smooth.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pretty smooth.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So the leaves
are a little fuzzy,

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:84%
but the vein of a
dandelion is smooth.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.850 align:middle line:90%
That's a true dandelion.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's one great
identifying characteristic.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So this one with
fuzz on it is not?

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So the one with fuzz
on it is not a dandelion.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.395 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of different
varieties of dandelions.

00:42:20.395 --> 00:42:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Like I already
mentioned, they're

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.090 align:middle line:90%
in the sunflower family.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:84%
The sunflower family is the
largest family of plants.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:32.402 align:middle line:84%
There's nearly 24,000 varieties,
and a lot of those are edible.

00:42:32.402 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
speak in absolutes.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.978 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
all of them are edible,

00:42:35.978 --> 00:42:37.520 align:middle line:84%
because some people
might be allergic

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.730 align:middle line:90%
to dandelion, for example.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And so for them,
they're not edible.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very good family to
get accustomed to because you

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.130 align:middle line:84%
could potentially expand
your food choices 24,000

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:90%
different ways, all right?

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there's over
300 varieties of dandelions,

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.190 align:middle line:90%
and all of them are edible.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You can eat the leaves in
smoothies, and soups, salads.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.930 align:middle line:90%
You can eat the flowers.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:90%
You can eat the stems.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And you can also eat the roots.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But generally, I
don't eat the roots

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:84%
because when you harvest the
roots, it kills the plant.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So in my book, I have a chapter
called "Respect the Roots."

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.440 align:middle line:84%
With something like a
dandelion, it's not a big issue

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.870 align:middle line:84%
because dandelions are
extremely resilient.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you see 100
dandelions growing,

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:84%
you can eat 99 of them,
and they'll be fine.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But with other plants,
like wild ginger,

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:28.070 align:middle line:84%
for example, it's
really, really sensitive.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:29.782 align:middle line:84%
So if you start
harvesting roots,

00:43:29.782 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wipe
out that population.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And then it won't grow there.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So in an effort to
be more ecological,

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, and responsible, I
often stay away from the roots,

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and just harvest the
greens and the fruits,

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.190 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like that's
nature's gift to us.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.033 align:middle line:84%
And I also am kind
of lazy sometimes,

00:43:48.033 --> 00:43:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it's a
lot easier to harvest

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.525 align:middle line:90%
some greens than some roots.

00:43:53.525 --> 00:43:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
I stand on roots.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
If you were to eat them, you
could bake them in the same way

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that you bake sweet
potatoes or potatoes.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.290 align:middle line:84%
In the South, they actually
make a coffee substitute out

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:84%
of dandelion roots
and chicory roots.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It does not have caffeine, so
you get the taste of coffee,

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.778 align:middle line:90%
but you don't get the stimulant.

00:44:11.778 --> 00:44:12.820 align:middle line:90%
What else can I tell you?

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Is there any other
questions about roots?

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you worry about the
soil that they're growing in?

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Like in this park,
would you eat the roots?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In this park, I probably
would not eat the roots

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.010 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't
done my due diligence.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I haven't called
the parks service

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what they
spray or don't spray.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But in my yard, I
would eat the roots.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.585 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:36.585 --> 00:44:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.280 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're standing under a tree.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what kind
of tree this is?

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Horse chestnut.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Horse chestnut.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So horse chestnuts are not
traditionally considered

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.960 align:middle line:90%
edible.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But since we're here, I
just want to point out--

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:90%
everybody grab a chestnut.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:58.780 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So they look very
similar to the chestnuts

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that we eat around
Christmas time.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:84%
The one major difference between
those and horse chestnuts

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.292 align:middle line:84%
is that the edible ones have
a deep point on one side.

00:45:10.292 --> 00:45:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And these ones are kind
of round with no point.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.125 align:middle line:84%
If you ever want to
identify a true chestnut,

00:45:14.125 --> 00:45:16.810 align:middle line:84%
it's going to look just like
this, but the butt of it

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.500 align:middle line:90%
is going to have a sharp point.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.540 align:middle line:90%
So why are some edible?

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Why are some not?

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It's an alkaloid issue.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.510 align:middle line:90%
We talked about oxalates.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Horse chestnuts just
concentrate more tannins.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.930 align:middle line:90%
So they're very bitter.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:90%
They hurt our stomach.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They're not considered edible,
so you would not eat these.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But the other chestnuts
with the point,

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:84%
they have less tannins,
thus, they are more edible.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, something like
this, Native Americans

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:84%
might not consider
poisonous because there

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
are ways of extracting tannins
from acorns and chestnuts.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.345 align:middle line:84%
But they're very
labor-intensive.

00:45:56.345 --> 00:45:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I'm
a little bit lazy.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I like to throw something
in my blender and get going.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So I can do it, but
I generally don't.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have
some wild grasses.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see there's two
different varieties at least.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have more of a
wild oat type-looking

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.360 align:middle line:90%
grass, which has seeds.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And then you have a big--

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.170 align:middle line:84%
you have another variety
of grass, which probably,

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:27.280 align:middle line:84%
from a foraging standpoint, is
going to be a much better thing

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.830 align:middle line:84%
to spend your time harvesting
because look how thick it

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.410 align:middle line:90%
is versus this.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And you pull on the top.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:38.230 align:middle line:84%
There's more meristematic
bits to eat versus this.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So one thing to think about
if you're harvesting food,

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go for something
that gives you more reward,

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.657 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
the thicker grass.

00:46:46.657 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:84%
The other thing worth pointing
out right here is blackberries.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So blackberries, obviously,
the berries are edible.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.880 align:middle line:84%
But the leaves on
blackberries are also edible.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they're really
good for things like dysentery,

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.390 align:middle line:90%
for fungus stuff.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:84%
They have antibacterial
properties.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're traveling,
for example,

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and you run into stomach
issues, you can eat charcoal,

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:84%
but you can also eat
blackberries, raspberries,

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:90%
thimble berries.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Those leaves will help
settle your stomach.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.862 align:middle line:90%
>> How would you eat them?

00:47:13.862 --> 00:47:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So how would you eat them?

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:18.340 align:middle line:90%
So right here, check it out.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Another lesson in meristems.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.770 align:middle line:90%
So everybody try and get close.

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
as the plant matures,

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.580 align:middle line:84%
the thorns get really
stiff and hard.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.277 align:middle line:84%
But then if you look
at the top part,

00:47:35.277 --> 00:47:36.610 align:middle line:90%
you see that it's lighter green.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the meristematic
part of the blackberry.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And now very carefully
just feel the thorns

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and notice how they're
not quite developed yet.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So you can go through
with a little knife,

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and peel the thorns, and eat the
little stems of the blackberry.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's more like your
little wild asparagus.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Or you can take the
young leaves, which

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.190 align:middle line:84%
are pretty much thornless,
use those in a salad.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Or if you boil them
down, the thorns

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.760 align:middle line:90%
become completely not an issue.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.950 align:middle line:90%
They just go away.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.840 align:middle line:84%
The best way that
I've found to use them

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.020 align:middle line:84%
is you just dry these leaves,
crush them up, throw them

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.040 align:middle line:90%
in tea.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And then take a
little bit with you

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.760 align:middle line:90%
when you travel internationally.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And now you know that this stuff
will help settle your stomach.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Now the one caution about your
blackberries and raspberries

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is you don't want to eat the
leaves when they're wilting.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So you want to eat them fresh,
or you want to fully dry them.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
wilting process, they

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.080 align:middle line:84%
start releasing more
alkaloids or something,

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and it can sometimes
have the opposite effect.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat them fresh, like
within an hour of harvesting,

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:42.670 align:middle line:84%
or fully dry,
completely, no problem.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.160 align:middle line:84%
All blackberries and raspberries
are in the rose family.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Roses, apples, blackberries
are in the same family.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those relatives
are edible and delicious.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:84%
By the way, wild roses are
delicious in salads, just

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.640 align:middle line:90%
the petals themselves.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And since in Washington,
you have a lot of them,

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.765 align:middle line:84%
and they grow like
weeds, eat the weeds.

00:49:05.765 --> 00:49:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Right behind you,
there's another plant

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:90%
It's called common mallow.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:18.490 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:30.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.954 align:middle line:84%
We'll sacrifice this
root for the group.

00:49:33.954 --> 00:49:35.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.522 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear it.

00:49:36.522 --> 00:49:37.480 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Chrysanthemum.

00:49:38.284 --> 00:49:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Geranium.

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Geranium.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, Geranium.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.746 align:middle line:90%
>> What else?

00:49:43.746 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It kind of looks
like a lily pad.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll tell you a little story.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Here in Tacoma,
actually, we're really

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.430 align:middle line:84%
lucky because two
really good foragers

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:55.840 align:middle line:90%
live within driving range.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.850 align:middle line:84%
One of my teachers, her
name is Karen Sherwood,

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:58.930 align:middle line:90%
she lives in Issaquah.

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And every Memorial
Day holiday, she

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:84%
hosts a three-day retreat
outside of Yakima,

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.920 align:middle line:84%
where all you do all day
long is you harvest plants,

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and then you make food,
and you harvest plants,

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:08.430 align:middle line:90%
and you make food.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Really good thing to
look up-- her company

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.455 align:middle line:90%
is called EarthWalk Northwest.

00:50:12.455 --> 00:50:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And then another guy does the
same thing out of Portland.

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.420 align:middle line:90%
His name is John Kallas.

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.650 align:middle line:90%
He's another awesome dude.

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to my
first workshop with Karen,

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:22.630 align:middle line:84%
she said, Sergei,
here's a big bowl.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Go get a bunch of clovers.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Put it in your salad.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put it
in everybody's salad.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So I go out with the bowl,
and I don't collect anything.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't find a single
clover to save my life.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And I come back deflated.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, Karen,
there's no clover.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:40.930 align:middle line:90%
She says, take this bowl.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the field.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Squat, crawl if you have to, but
bring it back full of clovers.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So I go back to the exact
same field where I was.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It was on a farm property.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And I squat, and I
start looking closely.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.970 align:middle line:84%
It was an entire
field of clover.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I just wasn't
looking close enough.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So there, I learned
the importance

00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.560 align:middle line:90%
of describing a plant.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I say, what
does it look like?

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.662 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking for
anything specific.

00:51:03.662 --> 00:51:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I am because I
know what it looks like,

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.940 align:middle line:84%
but I'm looking for keywords
to hear how will you

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.240 align:middle line:90%
remember this plant.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, what
does it look like?

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.950 align:middle line:84%
What I want to hear
from you is, how

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.360 align:middle line:90%
will you remember this plant?

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's try it again.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.118 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:51:19.118 --> 00:51:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>> A doily.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> A doily.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.122 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:51:22.122 --> 00:51:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:23.730 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's soft.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's soft.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.986 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:51:26.986 --> 00:51:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>> A rough stem though.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.390 align:middle line:90%
So look at all these things.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
Geranium and a doily.

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It's got a soft, fuzzy
flower and a rough stem.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Great characteristics.

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It has lots of stems
instead of just one main one.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It has lots of stems
instead of main ones.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at how
it's growing on the ground,

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.926 align:middle line:90%
what can you tell me?

00:51:50.926 --> 00:51:52.712 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's
a creeping plant,

00:51:52.712 --> 00:51:54.670 align:middle line:84%
or do you think it's
going to grow straight up?

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Creeping.

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Very good identifying
characteristic.

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So this plant is called mallow,
common mallow, or Malva.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.445 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a
close relative of okra.

00:52:06.445 --> 00:52:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you see this plant,
this is one of the best eats

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:12.340 align:middle line:90%
that you can forage.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very common weed.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It likes dry soils,
so you'll generally

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.210 align:middle line:90%
find it growing in the sun.

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Every part is edible,
though the flowers--

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:90%
or the leaves--

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.708 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry-- are
the most delicious.

00:52:25.708 --> 00:52:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to eat them,
they taste just like okra.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.790 align:middle line:84%
They have a gelatinous
quality to them.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:33.070 align:middle line:90%
So what can you do with that?

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.230 align:middle line:90%
You could put it in a gumbo.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Can make an okra gumbo.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Great in soups.

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, when you
make a smoothie,

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to separate,
kind of looks unappetizing,

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:49.660 align:middle line:84%
you throw a little common mallow
in it, and it binds it better.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
olden days, they used

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.870 align:middle line:84%
to use this plant in the
cheese-making process

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.180 align:middle line:84%
where they would use
it as a binding agent.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:90%
It also has little flowers.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And the flowers, they almost
look like the little bluebells

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.780 align:middle line:90%
that grow everywhere.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.135 align:middle line:84%
And these flowers are
delicious in salads.

00:53:09.135 --> 00:53:11.260 align:middle line:84%
If you ever go to a potluck,
and you bring a salad,

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.785 align:middle line:84%
and sprinkle a handful on top
of that, people will go bananas.

00:53:14.785 --> 00:53:17.903 align:middle line:90%


00:53:17.903 --> 00:53:19.070 align:middle line:90%
This grows in your backyard.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.242 align:middle line:84%
Any questions about
common mallow?

00:53:24.242 --> 00:53:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you spell that?

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> M-A-L-L-O-W. There's a
guy, his name is David Wolfe.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.070 align:middle line:90%
He's kind of a health nut guy.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.630 align:middle line:84%
He's been all over social
media for many years.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But when I met the guy, right
before we started hiking

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.410 align:middle line:84%
the trail, actually, he
introduced me to this plant.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And what we would
do is we'd just

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.270 align:middle line:84%
take big leaves of mallow,
roll avocado in them,

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and sprinkle them
with lemon juice.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.670 align:middle line:84%
It was a really delicious
snack, actually.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:90%
On we go.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.280 align:middle line:90%
We didn't go very far.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.720 align:middle line:90%
What is this plant right here?

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a bottle.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Somebody said it.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Dead nettle.

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Dead nettle.

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that sounds really scary.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Everybody grab one,
and let's study it.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:18.100 align:middle line:90%


00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:20.720 align:middle line:90%
We might sit here for a while.

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:26.063 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:27.230 align:middle line:90%
There's some over there too.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.200 align:middle line:84%
This is called
purple dead nettle.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.150 align:middle line:90%
And it has a very ominous name.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.950 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not
poisonous at all.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:39.046 align:middle line:90%
This is a wild mint.

00:54:39.046 --> 00:54:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't smell like mint.

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So we're engaging
all our senses.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Everybody smell it.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Kind of has a musky smell.

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's called
purple dead nettle

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:52.040 align:middle line:84%
is because it looks similar
to stinging nettles.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
people don't like the way

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.530 align:middle line:90%
that nettles itches.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's where
it got the name.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:00.390 align:middle line:90%
All mints have a square stem.

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So just like the dandelion
has a smooth stem,

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.270 align:middle line:90%
all mints have a square stem.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:07.730 align:middle line:84%
The mint family is
full of edible plants.

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:09.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a good thing to know.

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:11.060 align:middle line:90%
How would you use this?

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I would just basically
take that much of it

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and throw it in anything,
whether that is a salad.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit fuzzy, so I
probably wouldn't eat this raw.

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could eat it raw,
but because it's a little bit

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.700 align:middle line:84%
fuzzy, I wouldn't
enjoy it as much.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's come up with some
ways that you would eat this.

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:32.104 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:55:32.104 --> 00:55:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>> As a saute.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Tea.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Saute.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I like the tea idea, but
let's get creative here.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:41.460 align:middle line:84%
What else could
you do with this?

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.150 align:middle line:84%
If you say something I
don't like, I'll tell you.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Pizza.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Pizza.

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Tempura.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Tempura.

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I like it.

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Those are all great.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you eat the stem?

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>> You can eat the stem.

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And all mints, again,
help to calm the system.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you have any sort
of seasonal allergies,

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:06.260 align:middle line:84%
or you ate something, and it
doesn't agree with your belly,

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.627 align:middle line:84%
eating a little bit of mint
will help to soothe it.

00:56:09.627 --> 00:56:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really
good thing to know.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.335 align:middle line:84%
So maybe if you're going
traveling internationally,

00:56:13.335 --> 00:56:15.430 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go
above and beyond,

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:18.470 align:middle line:84%
you take some purple dead
nettle, and you dry the leaves.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.022 align:middle line:84%
And you mix it with some
blackberries or raspberries,

00:56:21.022 --> 00:56:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and you dry the leaves.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And you make yourself a little
bag of greens, which hopefully,

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.410 align:middle line:90%
customs won't sniff you for.

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I usually put it in a
little supplement bottle.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.488 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
supplements are good.

00:56:34.488 --> 00:56:35.943 align:middle line:90%
They have a nice little thing.

00:56:35.943 --> 00:56:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I just make a
tea out of them abroad.

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, who remembers the
quiz that I gave them?

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Everybody grab some of these.

00:56:56.020 --> 00:57:01.696 align:middle line:90%


00:57:01.696 --> 00:57:04.610 align:middle line:84%
These are little
baby helicopters.

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And helicopters identify
a plant, or a tree,

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and what's that tree?

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Maple.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Maple.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So this forest-- this park
has lots of different types

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.260 align:middle line:90%
of trees in it.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And trees are a class
of foods that I would

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.657 align:middle line:90%
consider as a survival food.

00:57:23.657 --> 00:57:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the
common trees that we're

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:28.348 align:middle line:84%
used to encountering have
edible parts, and maple

00:57:28.348 --> 00:57:29.390 align:middle line:90%
is certainly one of them.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.390 align:middle line:84%
They're in that grass area,
where it's not the best

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:33.560 align:middle line:90%
meal that you'll ever have.

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But they are edible, so
in dire circumstances,

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.740 align:middle line:84%
you could eat these
tiny little maple seeds.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.240 align:middle line:90%
They'll give you some nutrition.

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.300 align:middle line:84%
You can also see how some of
these leaves are very tender.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's maple,
so they're very sticky.

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Grab a leaf.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Feel a leaf.

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And that stickiness is
actually maple syrup, right?

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:56.540 align:middle line:84%
The lifeblood of a maple
tree is a clear fluid

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.280 align:middle line:90%
that's like maple juice.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And then people will go
in here, and tap the tree,

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and get a big bucket full
of this clear maple juice,

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.430 align:middle line:90%
maple blood.

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll boil it
down for about 30 hours.

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:08.330 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's 30 hours.

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It might even be longer.

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it'll
concentrate and turn

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.182 align:middle line:90%
into maple syrup.

00:58:14.182 --> 00:58:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And just like you can
do that with maple,

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.020 align:middle line:90%
you could also do it with birch.

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:21.260 align:middle line:90%
You could do it with aspen.

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in Europe,
during World War II,

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:27.620 align:middle line:84%
when there was food shortages,
a lot of people in Russia,

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and Germany, and France,
they actually went,

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and they would eat
little buds of maples,

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:34.460 align:middle line:90%
the seed pods, the leaves.

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And they would cook
them in their soups.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.720 align:middle line:90%
It's pure nutrition.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's really good
to know about that.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Hey, this is a maple.

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:43.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a beech.

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:44.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a birch.

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And all parts of those
things are edible.

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:49.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a layer
inside the bark called

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the cambium layer,
the inner layer,

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.780 align:middle line:90%
it makes for good eating.

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.360 align:middle line:84%
That would be in the same
category as roots though.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.635 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know exactly
what you're doing so as

00:58:58.635 --> 00:58:59.510 align:middle line:90%
not to kill the tree.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Over here.

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:23.530 align:middle line:90%


00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:31.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, if I was a wild
edible superhero,

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:34.468 align:middle line:84%
and I had a tool
belt, on my tool belt,

00:59:34.468 --> 00:59:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I would certainly
include this plant.

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So grab a leaf and
pass it around.

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:45.130 align:middle line:90%


00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to see if I can't
find the other-- there's

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:48.870 align:middle line:90%
two varieties of this plant.

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Here, grab a leaf,
pass it around.

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:54.115 align:middle line:84%
This is called plantain, and it
has no relation to the banana.

00:59:54.115 --> 00:59:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:00.370 align:middle line:90%
This is a very fun plant.

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:02.290 align:middle line:84%
This plant has a lot
of amino acids in it,

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:07.150 align:middle line:84%
which is also known as protein,
a lot of plant-based protein.

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:09.740 align:middle line:84%
The reason I would have this
on my belt as a superhero

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.790 align:middle line:84%
is because this plant can
literally save your life.

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So plantain has this
miraculous quality

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:19.430 align:middle line:84%
to draw poison out of
your system topically.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a
couple years ago, I

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.640 align:middle line:84%
was showing off in
front of some friends,

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
and I was doing a handstand.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I fell in the grass, and
I got stung on my back

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:30.010 align:middle line:90%
by numerous bees.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not allergic,
so it wasn't a big deal.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you are, it could have
been a really big deal, right?

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:37.000 align:middle line:90%
So it started to hurt.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:37.990 align:middle line:90%
It was uncomfortable.

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And I knew what to do.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I ran around, and
I found this plant.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.767 align:middle line:90%
I chewed it up, made a poultice.

01:00:43.767 --> 01:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Spit it into my friend's
hand, and I said, can you

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.980 align:middle line:90%
please rub it on my back?

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 minutes,
the pain is gone.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever get stung
by an ant, a bee, a spider.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.600 align:middle line:84%
If you step on a
rusty piece of metal,

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get to
the hospital right away,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.150 align:middle line:84%
this plant will actually
draw toxins out of your skin.

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Janice Schofield,
an author that wrote

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a book called "Discovering
Wild Plants," she

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
talks about how her dad, I
guess he was accident prone,

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and so one time, he treated a
gunshot wound with this stuff.

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And another time, he
had blood poisoning,

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
which is a very
serious thing, and he

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:23.650 align:middle line:84%
was able to not die,
basically, by applying plantain

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:24.550 align:middle line:90%
to the wound.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
of psyllium husk?

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> What is psyllium husk?

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:31.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like a-- oh, here you go.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Liz found it.

01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the other
variety of plantain.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Good job, Liz.

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is
lance-leaf plantain.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.470 align:middle line:90%
This is broad-leaf plantain.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So psyllium husk is a
supplement-type food

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.050 align:middle line:90%
that helps digestion.

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like natural
vegan gelatin, right?

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Where does psyllium
husk come from?

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.875 align:middle line:90%
Plantain.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a wild-crafted food.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So plantain will develop
these seed pods that

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:00.460 align:middle line:90%
look very similar to baby corn.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a little too
early for it right now,

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.560 align:middle line:84%
but they'll develop these
massive, long stalks

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that can have up to
20,000 seeds on them.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And those little stalks are
delicious when you boil them.

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:13.510 align:middle line:90%
They taste just like baby corn.

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
When those 20,000 seeds all
develop husks around them,

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
people somehow
shake the husk away,

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
psyllium husk is.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So what are some of the key
identifying characteristics

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:28.394 align:middle line:90%
of plantain?

01:02:28.394 --> 01:02:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fibrous at the bottom.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fibrous at the bottom.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Another color inside.

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the top of the
leaf is a darker green

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.100 align:middle line:90%
than the bottom of the leaf.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.435 align:middle line:90%
Can everybody see that?

01:02:43.435 --> 01:02:45.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:45.498 --> 01:02:46.915 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something
very obvious.

01:02:46.915 --> 01:02:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>> The veins grow out long.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So the veins grow
out really long.

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that?

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They're very easy
to distinguish.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:55.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that too.

01:02:55.786 --> 01:02:57.718 align:middle line:90%
>> It smells wonderful.

01:02:57.718 --> 01:02:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I want to eat it.

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:01.518 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that you
like greens, don't you?

01:03:01.518 --> 01:03:02.318 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:02.318 --> 01:03:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I love greens.

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> So here, check this out.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Here's one of my own personal
identifying characteristics.

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the
stem of plantain,

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.680 align:middle line:90%
and you carefully crush it.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>> So cool.

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> So try that.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.860 align:middle line:84%
If you can find
plantain near you,

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.970 align:middle line:84%
see if you can expose
some of the threads.

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:26.858 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

01:03:26.858 --> 01:03:28.750 align:middle line:90%


01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Here, I'll come over here.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Here, play around with that.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show these folks.

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:38.230 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:39.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, so yeah.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
See how they have
these lateral veins?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:03:44.008 --> 01:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If you just pull
really carefully,

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:47.395 align:middle line:90%
it starts exposing threads.

01:03:47.395 --> 01:03:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like it's been sewn.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Like it's been sewn.

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So now you know what
plantain is like, right?

01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're ever in
doubt, like, is that plantain?

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to say, oh,
veins that you can easily see.

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Long seed pods.

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you pull on the stalk,
it's going to reveal threads.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:08.807 align:middle line:90%
plantain.

01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you eat the leaves?

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, you
can eat the leaves.

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty rich
in chlorophyll,

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
which is not a bad thing,
but they do taste strong.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.610 align:middle line:90%
This would be an advanced green.

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So put it in a soup.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Throw it on a pizza.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I literally cram wild
edibles into everything.

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was researching my
book, I'm sitting there,

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.948 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just like, what
is this plant good for?

01:04:29.948 --> 01:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I have nutritional
data in there.

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I kid you not, the
USDA, there's a website

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.450 align:middle line:90%
called nutritionaldata.com.

01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
USDA information

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.518 align:middle line:84%
from the '60s, when
the government just

01:04:44.518 --> 01:04:46.810 align:middle line:84%
had a bunch of money they
were throwing at figuring out

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:49.210 align:middle line:90%
what food is rich in.

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, they have
quite a few wild edibles

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.020 align:middle line:90%
on there.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.895 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there,
compiling these charts.

01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:57.005 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, well,
what is plantain good for?

01:04:57.005 --> 01:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally
good for everything.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:59.430 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:00.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not an exaggeration.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.572 align:middle line:90%
What is dandelion good for?

01:05:02.572 --> 01:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It's literally good
for everything.

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's got tons of
vitamins and minerals.

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It's got amino
acids, antioxidants.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
I was like, it's

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
kind of silly to remember exact
things because it's literally

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.872 align:middle line:90%
good for everything.

01:05:15.872 --> 01:05:17.887 align:middle line:84%
OK, see this plant with
the purple flowers?

01:05:17.887 --> 01:05:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll meet you right by it.

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:29.850 align:middle line:90%


01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:31.815 align:middle line:90%
Look how pretty this is.

01:05:31.815 --> 01:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what
kind of plant this is,

01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:36.630 align:middle line:90%
but I know that it's a mustard.

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I know
that it's a mustard

01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
is because mustards are in
the Brassica family, which has

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
nearly 2,000 different plants.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It includes broccoli,
cauliflower, cabbage.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And all mustards
smell like mustard.

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:52.797 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we rely
too heavily on our eyes.

01:05:52.797 --> 01:05:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And we can just be like, oh, I
don't really know what this is.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.713 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it looks like.

01:05:56.713 --> 01:06:02.588 align:middle line:84%
But then you come over here, you
grab a leaf, you crush it up.

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a mustard, it should
start smelling like mustard.

01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to come over
here and do this with me.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.520 align:middle line:90%
This one's pretty faint.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
There's other characteristics,
but the leaves on this

01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.902 align:middle line:90%
are pretty faint-smelling.

01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Can anybody get a
little hint of mustard?

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:26.420 align:middle line:90%


01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Look at how big this leaf is.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So did we get a little
hint of mustard?

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
If not, there's another
mustard over here

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.490 align:middle line:90%
that you'll definitely smell it.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Look how big this leaf is.

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:39.650 align:middle line:84%
You can literally wrap,
make little wraps in this.

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
One thing I like to do,
I call it gorilla wraps.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, ooh.

01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.590 align:middle line:90%
No, just kidding.

01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:47.885 align:middle line:84%
You take a banana, and you
wrap it in a green leaf.

01:06:47.885 --> 01:06:49.010 align:middle line:90%
It could be a collard leaf.

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:50.010 align:middle line:90%
It could be a kale leaf.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:51.950 align:middle line:90%
It could be a wild mustard leaf.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.822 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find
is that the greens will

01:06:53.822 --> 01:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
complement the
fruit, and the fruit

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.110 align:middle line:90%
will complement the greens.

01:06:57.110 --> 01:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
You could also make a
nice dolma out of this.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:03.950 align:middle line:90%


01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Say you like low calorie diets--

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
here's a perfect
little tortilla.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Also, it has these
beautiful flowers.

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:11.710 align:middle line:90%
All mustards have four petals.

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:14.690 align:middle line:84%
They can be different colors--
yellow, white, purple, pink.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And come over here
and grab one of these.

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
All mustards also
have six stamen.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Stamen are those
tiny little antennae

01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:25.310 align:middle line:90%
that are in the flower.

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So they have four
petals, six stamen.

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:32.575 align:middle line:84%
Four of those are going to be
long, and two will be short.

01:07:32.575 --> 01:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And then this one,
in particular,

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
has its own version
of the seed pod, which

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.777 align:middle line:90%
is like a little pea, almost.

01:07:38.777 --> 01:07:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And you can eat those too.

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.050 align:middle line:84%
They have a spicy,
peppery taste.

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So if I was picking
this plant for food,

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:46.070 align:middle line:90%
I'd be like, look, big leaves.

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
something with those.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.165 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll cut
them into a salad.

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But since they're big, I'd
probably make a wrap out

01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:52.460 align:middle line:90%
of this.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.710 align:middle line:84%
This, I'd probably throw
on top of the salad

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:56.870 align:middle line:90%
because they're nice, peppery.

01:07:56.870 --> 01:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
They would enrich it,
make it look beautiful.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the seed
pods would just

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.110 align:middle line:90%
add a little bit of crunch.

01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:05.240 align:middle line:90%
They'd be like a wild sweet pea.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
John Kallas, who has a book
called, "Wild Edibles--

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:09.650 align:middle line:90%
From Dirt to Plate."

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
He says that wild mustards,
through his research,

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
are the most nutritious
green on the planet.

01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a really
good one to know about.

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go this way because
I want to actually demonstrate

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
how different two
mustards can look,

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and yet, they still
smell like mustard.

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.279 align:middle line:90%
Check out this plant.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.095 align:middle line:84%
If you touch it, it
starts shooting seeds.

01:08:33.095 --> 01:08:33.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

01:08:33.895 --> 01:08:34.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:34.745 --> 01:08:35.545 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:36.979 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought they
were mad at me.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on, you guys.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a bittercress,
which is a mustard.

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:43.279 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've been
criticized for in my book

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't have regions
for where the plants grow.

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I did
that is because plants,

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.894 align:middle line:84%
just like humans and
animals, they love to travel.

01:08:49.894 --> 01:08:51.140 align:middle line:90%
[DOG BARKING]

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.859 align:middle line:84%
And they have different
mechanisms for doing this.

01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:56.899 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
This plant, it propagates
when you touch it.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.689 align:middle line:84%
It literally shoots
out feet away.

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:04.479 align:middle line:84%
That's the plant
saying, I'm going

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.979 align:middle line:90%
to produce a lot of offspring.

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:11.069 align:middle line:84%
Maybe let's go over there
so the dog settles down.

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So plants love to travel,
and in the natural world,

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.080 align:middle line:90%
they get pretty far.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
regional thing, that's

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:23.870 align:middle line:84%
just something we humans
have made up for convenience.

01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:26.120 align:middle line:84%
But nature isn't here
for our convenience.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.557 align:middle line:90%
Let's take one of this.

01:09:28.557 --> 01:09:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
crush it up and see

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.819 align:middle line:90%
if it smells like mustard.

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:35.599 align:middle line:90%
Yep, smells like mustard.

01:09:35.599 --> 01:09:36.399 align:middle line:90%
You get it?

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:51.700 align:middle line:90%


01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Who gets mustard?

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.145 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if
you get mustard.

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I get a, like, a musty smell.

01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:00.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's a very distinct.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So not like the yellow
mustard that comes in a can,

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%
but like arugula mustard.

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Think that.

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:10.270 align:middle line:90%
You get it?

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:13.830 align:middle line:90%


01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:16.440 align:middle line:90%
So this is called bittercress.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's a mustard relative.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:20.826 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what kind
of tree this is?

01:10:20.826 --> 01:10:21.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Elm?

01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Alder?

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It looks very
similar to an alder.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you just
look at the leaves,

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
they kind of look
like alder leaves.

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.940 align:middle line:90%
This is actually a beech tree.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the tall
tales of a beech

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
is that it has
elephant-like skin.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's a great
identifying characteristic.

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
right beneath your feet.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we
can figure it out.

01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So give yourself a
little squat, and see

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.150 align:middle line:90%
if you can't find some nuts.

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Beech nuts.

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Beech nuts.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is how this works.

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I think
that's an alder.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at your surroundings

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and you start engaging
your other senses.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And you find beech nuts.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
there's no nuts in it.

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:05.656 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

01:11:05.656 --> 01:11:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the
squirrels took them.

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:08.610 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:09.410 align:middle line:90%
We found some nuts.

01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is a beech
nut right here.

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So in nature, we also
compete with other critters.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And squirrels are much
better at harvesting nuts

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
than we are because they've
had lots more practice.

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's also not nut season.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So right now, if we
lived seasonally,

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
right now would be our time
to eat mustards, and kale,

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and dandelions, and grass.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And then later on
in the season, we

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
would be eating more nuts,
things like beech nuts.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So these are essentially
similar to acorns.

01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
The Native tribes used
to make meal out of them,

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.798 align:middle line:84%
and make breads, and
cookies, and all kinds

01:11:49.798 --> 01:11:51.090 align:middle line:90%
of little biscuits out of them.

01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, there's
not a whole lot

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:54.212 align:middle line:84%
to talk about because
these are last year's nuts,

01:11:54.212 --> 01:11:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's not great.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.520 align:middle line:90%
But it is a good food source.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.320 align:middle line:90%
They're edible.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
They require a little
bit more food prep

01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
than some of the greens,
again, because they

01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
have tannins in them,
and tannins come off

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.440 align:middle line:90%
as extremely bitter.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So traditionally, you
would either soak them

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.030 align:middle line:90%
or boil them in water.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans would
actually take a wicker basket,

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
put a bunch of nuts in there,
like acorns, and just stick

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.950 align:middle line:90%
that basket in the stream.

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
ingenious, because it

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
wasn't any extra work
for them, but the water

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.972 align:middle line:84%
that was perpetually changing
would wash the tannins out.

01:12:24.972 --> 01:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
take those nuts

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
after 24 or 48 hours,
grind them, make a flour,

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and then make food out of it.

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So looks like an alder,
has elephant-like skin,

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and then when you get
close and personal,

01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:40.620 align:middle line:90%
you see that it has little nuts.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And now we just
identified beech.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:46.730 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
all gardeners should know.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:47.715 align:middle line:90%
The little white stuff.

01:12:47.715 --> 01:12:48.515 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:12:48.515 --> 01:12:50.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that meadow palm?

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> That might be one
common name for it.

01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:53.690 align:middle line:90%
I know this as chickweed.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So everybody grab
yourself a chickweed.

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:58.976 align:middle line:84%
This is the macro part
of the wild edible walk.

01:12:58.976 --> 01:12:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Chickweed is
like a wild lettuce.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:03.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a very common herb.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a very common
weed in gardens.

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you go, and you plant
a garden, a lot of weeds

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
start growing there.

01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you weed them out
before they really get big,

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
before you can
identify what they are,

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
you miss out on a
bunch of free food.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends in
Missoula runs a garden.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.590 align:middle line:90%
He just runs a big farm.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the stuff that grows
in between the rows of corn,

01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
or onion, or whatever,
is things like chickweed.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually more
nutritious than the food that's

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:31.890 align:middle line:90%
being grown.

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:33.223 align:middle line:90%
We just forget to look for them.

01:13:33.223 --> 01:13:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So Kiley, my girlfriend,
can attest to this.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We're planting our
garden right now.

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And she really
desperately wants to weed,

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.920 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, save that.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.400 align:middle line:90%
That's really good food.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a vitamin C powerhouse.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is like nature's
Emergen-C. I believe

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
a cup of this has over 90
milligrams of vitamin C,

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.670 align:middle line:90%
so that's antioxidant-rich.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.862 align:middle line:84%
It's got properties that
will help fight off cancer.

01:13:56.862 --> 01:13:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be less
likely to ever develop cancer

01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.987 align:middle line:90%
if you eat this stuff.

01:13:59.987 --> 01:14:01.170 align:middle line:90%
And it tastes awesome.

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.030 align:middle line:90%
It's like a really mild lettuce.

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:06.633 align:middle line:90%
Let's examine the flowers first.

01:14:06.633 --> 01:14:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what they look like.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.530 align:middle line:90%


01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>> The petals.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> How many petals does it have?

01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody's vision good
enough to count the petals?

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> 10?

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> 10?

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> So very good.

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It looks like 10 petals,
but it's actually only 5,

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
but the petals are
very deeply cleft.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see what you're saying.

01:14:25.784 --> 01:14:26.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:14:26.657 --> 01:14:27.740 align:middle line:90%
They're like double-cleft.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> See what I mean?

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a double petal.

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that chickweed has--

01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
this is very hard to
explain, but you can see it--

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is it has a mohawk hairline
on one side of the stem that

01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:40.160 align:middle line:90%
alternates in between leaves.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So if this is a section,
and then that's a section,

01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and below that leaf is another
section, there's a hairline.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It'll jump to opposite
sides of the stem.

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:52.895 align:middle line:90%


01:14:52.895 --> 01:14:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's a plant
that likes shade.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Look.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It's growing under a tree.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.490 align:middle line:84%
It's communicating
more information to us.

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
It likes shade, so this
beech is doing that for it.

01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:11.610 align:middle line:90%
And it likes to spread on grass.

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:13.910 align:middle line:90%
This is like a wild sprout.

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Super good raw in
sandwiches, wraps.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
If you ever go to the
deli and get a sandwich,

01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
if that's your
guilty pleasure, just

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
make sure you throw
some chickweed on it.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of Christmas-like
trees in this world, right?

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.387 align:middle line:84%
Can be very difficult
to tell them apart.

01:15:30.387 --> 01:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a little
trick right here and now.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Pine needles are
long, generally, long.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Spruce needles kind of
almost look like mint stems.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
They have four corners,
so you can spin them

01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:42.740 align:middle line:90%
in between your fingers.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
If you can spin it,
it's probably a spruce.

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
If you can't spin it,
it'll be flat, it's a fir.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So now you just learned
all about conifers.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Long needles-- pine.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Short needles that kind of
look like pipe cleaners,

01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
at first glance, could
either be spruce or fir.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And then you do the test.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.100 align:middle line:90%
It spins-- it's a spruce.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't spin-- it's a fir.

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:10.410 align:middle line:90%
So this is your test over here.

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Come over here.

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:21.368 align:middle line:90%


01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do this at
least three times while we're

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.460 align:middle line:90%
in the park.

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Grab a needle.

01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I know it's kind of cheating
because that branch probably

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.730 align:middle line:90%
fell off this tree.

01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:35.060 align:middle line:90%


01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.484 align:middle line:90%
What kind of tree is this?

01:16:37.484 --> 01:16:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Spruce.

01:16:38.770 --> 01:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%


01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a party
trick right here.

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Next time you're hiking
with your friends,

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:47.880 align:middle line:90%
just say, guess what?

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.680 align:middle line:90%
This is a spruce.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.710 align:middle line:90%


01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
All evergreens have
edible properties.

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
They actually also
concentrate vitamin C.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They're really good
for respiratory stuff.

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you have any sort of
cough or phlegm going on,

01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:09.500 align:middle line:84%
the best thing to do for that is
to make a tea from the needles.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So you basically
get a pot, throw

01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:15.710 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of needles in
there, and then heat it up,

01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:18.380 align:middle line:90%
boil it for like two minutes.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Then let it cool so
that it's drinkable.

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And pour yourself a nice little
glass of pine needle tea.

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Kind of has a
Christmasy vibe to it,

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:29.928 align:middle line:84%
but it has a really nice,
lemony characteristic.

01:17:29.928 --> 01:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great thing to
do when you're camping.

01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:34.262 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you want to engage
your kids, or your friends,

01:17:34.262 --> 01:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
or your partners, next
time you go camping--

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
this is Sergei's
homework number two--

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
just harvest some either
spruce, or pine, or fir,

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and make some trailside
tea for yourself.

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you eat the spruce tips?

01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> You can eat the spruce tips.

01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:52.473 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
beat me to the punch.

01:17:52.473 --> 01:17:55.640 align:middle line:90%
There's a tree that has them.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad that you
pointed that out.

01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The only caution
on evergreens is

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.987 align:middle line:84%
if you're pregnant
or nursing, you

01:18:02.987 --> 01:18:04.820 align:middle line:84%
want to avoid them
because there's something

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that small kids and
fetuses don't like.

01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
pregnant, avoid that.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.063 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they're completely
edible and beneficial.

01:18:14.063 --> 01:18:17.930 align:middle line:90%


01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a nice
little birch here.

01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is like a
survival food, in my opinion.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:26.060 align:middle line:90%


01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
If I was starving to death,
I would come over here,

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'd eat some of
the tender leaves.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
These buds are a really
good food source.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
bit past its prime,

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
but these little guys, when
they're green, like baby corn.

01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:42.400 align:middle line:90%
You can boil it.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you can imagine if you've
got maybe a gallon of these,

01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that would be a pretty
substantial food source.

01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Again, the inner cambian
layer, the bark of the tree,

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.160 align:middle line:90%
is edible.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.327 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't do it
right, you can kill the tree,

01:18:54.327 --> 01:18:55.800 align:middle line:90%
so I generally avoid that.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.210 align:middle line:90%
But birches are edible.

01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
This is probably the most
pathetic miner's lettuce

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.460 align:middle line:84%
specimen I've ever seen, but
because it's in the park,

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.653 align:middle line:90%
I figured we'd talk about it.

01:19:06.653 --> 01:19:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll let you take a picture.

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:13.580 align:middle line:90%


01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.176 align:middle line:90%
Look at how unique that looks.

01:19:15.176 --> 01:19:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really interesting.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is called a basal
rosette, this growth pattern.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Mustards do this too.

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:25.310 align:middle line:90%
They kind of spread out.

01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one
stalk and leaves.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.308 align:middle line:90%
So everybody grab one of these.

01:19:32.308 --> 01:19:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Take one, pass it around.

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:36.460 align:middle line:90%


01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Miner's lettuce is one of
the tastiest wild edibles.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
This tastes like
butterhead lettuce.

01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And it also has lots
of vitamin C in it.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
We used to do trade shows,
like health fairs and book

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.370 align:middle line:90%
conventions.

01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And so at one of these
fairs, our neighbor

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.493 align:middle line:84%
in the booth next to us,
he got on his high horse,

01:19:54.493 --> 01:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
where he's like,
I'm going to make

01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Sergei eat some supplements.

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have nothing
against supplements

01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
other than that they try
and sell them to people

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:04.820 align:middle line:90%
through fear-based tactics.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So this guy would
not let me alone.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you need
to try my supplement.

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You're just not getting
enough nutrition in your diet.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And he had some
device that somehow

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:16.160 align:middle line:84%
could calculate how
many antioxidants

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.760 align:middle line:90%
were in your system.

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And so finally,
he made me a deal.

01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:22.447 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'll leave you
alone if you take my test.

01:20:22.447 --> 01:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And if I find that you're
lacking in antioxidants,

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:26.290 align:middle line:90%
you have to try my supplement.

01:20:26.290 --> 01:20:28.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, whatever.

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:30.320 align:middle line:90%
So he puts me through the test.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And his scale was
like 0 to 10,000.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I forget his unit
of measurement,

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.710 align:middle line:90%
but it's not really important.

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So as close to 10,000 is
ideal as possible, right?

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:48.600 align:middle line:84%
When he measured
me, I had 50,000.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So I was literally
off his chart.

01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So then he was like, OK,
well, something went wrong.

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%
So he tested me again.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Same result. He tested my mom.

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.580 align:middle line:90%
She had 45,000.

01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.510 align:middle line:90%
My dad had the most.

01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:00.770 align:middle line:90%
He had 70.

01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, OK, wait,
what do you guys do again?

01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So then he was like, OK,
I'm prepared to listen.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So miner's lettuce is
really rich in antioxidants.

01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
It's good to get as much
as we can in our diet.

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And this will do it, as
well as all of the greens

01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:16.680 align:middle line:90%
that we've been talking about.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.305 align:middle line:84%
And so we've already
identified that it

01:21:18.305 --> 01:21:19.610 align:middle line:90%
grows in a basal rosette.

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:25.340 align:middle line:84%
The key tell of miner's lettuce
is the disk-shaped leaves.

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the stem goes directly
through the middle of the leaf.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a satellite dish.

01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:30.795 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a satellite dish.

01:21:30.795 --> 01:21:31.595 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's like a--

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:34.550 align:middle line:90%
[BEEPING SOUNDS]

01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Pop quiz.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.748 align:middle line:84%
How do you identify
a true dandelion?

01:21:37.748 --> 01:21:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Smooth vein.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Smooth vein.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.164 align:middle line:84%
How do you identify a
miner's lettuce leaf?

01:21:45.164 --> 01:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It looks like
a satellite dish.

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Looks like a satellite dish.

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:50.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the right answer.

01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:53.300 align:middle line:84%
It has a disk leaf,
and then the stem

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.760 align:middle line:90%
goes directly through the leaf.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%
How would I eat this?

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.958 align:middle line:84%
This is a great
plant to eat raw.

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like spinach
if you try and cook it.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.940 align:middle line:84%
You need to get pounds of it,
and then when you cook it down,

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.710 align:middle line:90%
it's going to go, whoop.

01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So more often than not, I would
just eat it raw in a salad.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It's really delicious.

01:22:11.690 --> 01:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You almost don't need
to do anything to it.

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.020 align:middle line:90%
It tastes great.

01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they look
so puny and pathetic

01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
here is because this
plant likes shade.

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So it usually grows under
trees, on hillsides.

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:24.728 align:middle line:90%
If you go to Chambers Bay--

01:22:24.728 --> 01:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
where you never want to
harvest, because you don't want

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.940 align:middle line:90%
to harvest from golf courses--

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:32.420 align:middle line:84%
but if you do the loop, you'll
see that along the hillside,

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.705 align:middle line:90%
there's tons of miner's lettuce.

01:22:34.705 --> 01:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
variety there

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.940 align:middle line:84%
called Siberian
miner's lettuce, which

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.100 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit different.

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.010 align:middle line:90%
On we go.

01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Everybody grab one.

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.712 align:middle line:90%


01:22:47.712 --> 01:22:49.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, actually,
let's take this moment

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:51.340 align:middle line:90%
to just chill for a second.

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I know we're getting close,
but we have maybe three or four

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:57.650 align:middle line:90%
more plants to look at.

01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:00.460 align:middle line:90%
So these are wild daisies.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And daisies are in
the sunflower family.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of sunflowers, we
already discerned, are edible.

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
There's almost 24,000
different varieties.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So these little ground daisies
are really good to eat raw.

01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, actually, if
you find some leaves,

01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
they're pretty hard to
get to under the grass,

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:25.000 align:middle line:84%
but the leaves remind
me of arugula, almost.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
They kind of have this
slightly skunky smell to them.

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I would throw
the leaves in a salad.

01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I would throw the
flowers in a salad

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.070 align:middle line:84%
because they're
beautiful, they're edible.

01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I would, again, take the
petals, and throw them

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
in an ice cube tray, and
make petal-infused ice.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe while I was harvesting
dandelion greens and flowers,

01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I would take some
of these daisies,

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.475 align:middle line:84%
and mix them with the
flowers, and throw them

01:23:48.475 --> 01:23:50.800 align:middle line:90%
in honey or maple syrup.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And that way, when it gets cold,
cloudy, and dreary in Tacoma,

01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I would go to make
a piece of toast,

01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and I would just spread some
of that jam on my toast,

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and get a little boost of
vitamin D. It's literally

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:02.230 align:middle line:90%
that simple.

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing I want to
talk about since we're here

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.050 align:middle line:90%
is clover.

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So most lawns in the
world, at this point,

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.403 align:middle line:84%
I've been to 66 countries,
and I can say with confidence

01:24:10.403 --> 01:24:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that in every country
that I've been to,

01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to
find clover on a lawn.

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So most lawns have
clover on them.

01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Grab a clover leaf.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.490 align:middle line:90%


01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Clovers are in the pea family.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So they're like wild peas,
which is the first thing

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.940 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And peas have a lot
of protein in them.

01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And they also have B vitamins--

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:39.230 align:middle line:90%
B1, B2, B3, B6, B12.

01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:42.200 align:middle line:90%
They also have phosphorus.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe magnesium,
manganese, and zinc.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So they're very, very
nutritious and delicious.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.380 align:middle line:84%
You could just take
this little leaf

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and throw it in
your soup, salad.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Cook it.

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Eat it raw.

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I like smoothies,
personally, because I

01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:55.710 align:middle line:84%
feel like that's the easiest
way to get greens in our diet.

01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:58.635 align:middle line:84%
One of my comments on my
book on Amazon, some guy

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
went through my book and counted
how many times I say smoothie.

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.568 align:middle line:90%
And I think I say it 250 times.

01:25:03.568 --> 01:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I didn't
realize how much this guy likes

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.110 align:middle line:90%
smoothies.

01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But the only reason I do is
because it's just an easy way

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.570 align:middle line:90%
to get greens in our diet.

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
You just wake up, make
a smoothie for yourself.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And that ensures
that you're going

01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
to get at least two salads in
smoothie form in your diet.

01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is a great thing
to do in smoothies.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
to identify this thing.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.300 align:middle line:90%
So all peas have three leaves.

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're lucky,
then they have four.

01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Clover has four, sometimes.

01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And we call that a
four-leaf clover.

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that a
four-leaf clover is actually

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.320 align:middle line:84%
more nutritious than
a three-leaf clover?

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.170 align:middle line:90%
It's 25% more nutritious.

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Another identifying
characteristic of clover

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is that the leaf has a
crescent-shaped little white

01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:51.344 align:middle line:90%
part on it.

01:25:51.344 --> 01:25:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, it's beautiful.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful, right?

01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:57.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, now take the leaf
really close and personal,

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.422 align:middle line:84%
and look at the edges,
and tell me what you see.

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's jagged all around.

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It's jagged.

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:05.108 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like it has
tiny little spines on it.

01:26:05.108 --> 01:26:09.410 align:middle line:90%


01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Those are great identifying
characteristics.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.437 align:middle line:90%
It's literally that easy.

01:26:13.437 --> 01:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Right now, what
you're doing is you're

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
building your search
image of clover.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
We're spending time with
these plants intimately,

01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and you don't even realize,
maybe fully, right now,

01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:24.290 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing.

01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:26.468 align:middle line:84%
But later on, you go home,
or in a month, in a year,

01:26:26.468 --> 01:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be sitting
in a park with your friends,

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.170 align:middle line:90%
having a picnic.

01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:33.368 align:middle line:84%
And your hand is going to wander
because you get a little bored.

01:26:33.368 --> 01:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
pick up a clover,

01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be like,
huh, three leaves, oval,

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.920 align:middle line:90%
clover.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And that means I did my
job somewhat correctly.

01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:45.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, on we go.

01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
A few more, and then
we're going to head home,

01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:48.350 align:middle line:90%
answer some questions.

01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that
needs to go can go.

01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:53.585 align:middle line:90%
What kind of tree is this?

01:26:53.585 --> 01:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Pine.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we know?

01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Long needles.

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Long needles.

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:01.150 align:middle line:90%
A fun fact about pines.

01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Aw, this ruined my surprise.

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So another way to identify
pines is they always

01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:10.280 align:middle line:90%
either have two or five needles.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.120 align:middle line:90%
So they're going to be long.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they're either going
to have two or five needles.

01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can make
tea from these needles.

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Just boil these down.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm here to
look at today is this.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pine pollen.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're allergic to pollen,
probably not the best edible

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:29.700 align:middle line:90%
for you.

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not allergic to
pollen, this is pure protein.

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.980 align:middle line:90%
This is amino acids.

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So how you would harvest
this is you put a plastic bag

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.200 align:middle line:90%
over this, and you just shake.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Or you can literally just
take these, and just eat them,

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
or throw them in a
smoothie, or a soup.

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're making
some pizza, you could

01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:54.100 align:middle line:90%
put some of that in the dough.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Get creative.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And that stuff's
really nutritious.

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I want to
show you while you're here

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:05.380 align:middle line:84%
is this plant that
grows underneath it.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:08.777 align:middle line:90%
Let's all grab one of these.

01:28:08.777 --> 01:28:09.610 align:middle line:90%
We'll get some more.

01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:13.990 align:middle line:90%


01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:15.744 align:middle line:90%
Grab one, pass it around.

01:28:15.744 --> 01:28:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Neato.

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, this is another one
of those plants that we can

01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:25.760 align:middle line:84%
identify much easier
by smell than sight.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.724 align:middle line:84%
So crush this up, and tell
me what this smells like.

01:28:30.724 --> 01:28:31.872 align:middle line:90%
>> I could almost smell it.

01:28:31.872 --> 01:28:32.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

01:28:32.672 --> 01:28:33.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:28:33.159 --> 01:28:34.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Wintergreen or
something like that.

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that smells good.

01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is called yarrow.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And yarrow develops a very
big umbrella-like flower

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.070 align:middle line:90%
in late summer.

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it's white.

01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it's yellow.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it's pink.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.650 align:middle line:90%
And yarrow is another sleep aid.

01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:52.788 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
problems with insomnia,

01:28:52.788 --> 01:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
if you just have trouble
falling asleep at night,

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
you could take some
of that wild chamomile

01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.480 align:middle line:84%
that we learned about, you could
take some of those daisies,

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and you could take some yarrow,
which smells very sweet,

01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:06.410 align:middle line:90%
almost makes you salivate.

01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
You could dry it,
put it in a tea.

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And now you have a
foraged sleep aid.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Pretty cool, huh?

01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:16.520 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
nice about yarrow

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is if you ever cut yourself,
and you're in the woods,

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
you can literally press
this into your wound

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
because it has antiseptic,
antibacterial properties.

01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:27.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Vikings
used to use this.

01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:29.600 align:middle line:84%
They would actually fill
their wounds with it

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.490 align:middle line:90%
when they got battle wounds.

01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans
did similar stuff.

01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:37.610 align:middle line:84%
One time, when I was on the
trail, I cut through my palm

01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
while trying to cut
a piece of fruit

01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:43.070 align:middle line:90%
that we had in our backpack.

01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I was 50
miles away from a hospital,

01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
so there was no way that
I could stitch it up.

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But what I actually
took is rose petals,

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
because they're
natural bandages,

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and then I would alternate
that with yarrow.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can look
at my palm later,

01:29:57.710 --> 01:29:59.090 align:middle line:90%
but there's almost no scar.

01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:00.560 align:middle line:90%
It's sealed up really nicely.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Wild edibles can literally
save your life sometimes,

01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and this is another
one of those.

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:06.150 align:middle line:90%
What kind of tree is this?

01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:11.130 align:middle line:90%


01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:12.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Fir.

01:30:12.126 --> 01:30:15.114 align:middle line:90%


01:30:15.114 --> 01:30:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Fir.

01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.252 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of tree is this?

01:30:18.252 --> 01:30:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Fir.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we know?

01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.214 align:middle line:90%
>> It's flat.

01:30:21.214 --> 01:30:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It does not roll.

01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It does not roll
around in your--

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Flat.

01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Flat needles.

01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a fir.

01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:26.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, on we go.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:40.980 align:middle line:90%


01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:44.098 align:middle line:84%
Boys and girls, what
kind of tree is this?

01:30:44.098 --> 01:30:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Fir.

01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:46.646 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we know?

01:30:46.646 --> 01:30:48.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Flat.

01:30:48.065 --> 01:30:49.011 align:middle line:90%
>> No rolling.

01:30:49.011 --> 01:30:53.750 align:middle line:90%


01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, who thinks spruce?

01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:56.985 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

01:30:56.985 --> 01:30:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Who thinks fir?

01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Fir.

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:00.513 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, you're right.

01:31:00.513 --> 01:31:01.315 align:middle line:90%
It's a fir.

01:31:01.315 --> 01:31:03.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, on this one,
let's also point out

01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:06.330 align:middle line:90%
the bright, little, green tips.

01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Who was talking
about those earlier?

01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:08.850 align:middle line:90%
You were.

01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So these are awesome eating.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
These are like the
springtime green tips,

01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and they taste like lemon.

01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So these parts you throw
straight into salads.

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.420 align:middle line:84%
They concentrate
vitamin C. They're

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.590 align:middle line:90%
good for your respiratory.

01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
They get phlegm
out of your system.

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:29.340 align:middle line:90%
You can pickle them.

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:33.220 align:middle line:90%


01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the springtime, now,
I've come through here

01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
with a little bowl, and
I just start taking them.

01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:41.910 align:middle line:90%


01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And before long, I'd have
enough to really make a meal of.

01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
You can also use these
in tea, but they're not

01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:56.400 align:middle line:84%
quite-- these are the
meristematic bits of the fir,

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.860 align:middle line:84%
so they're not going
to be as fragrant.

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I think for tea, you use
the more mature ones.

01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And then for eating,
for salads, you

01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:06.160 align:middle line:84%
use the more nutritious,
more delicious bits,

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.220 align:middle line:90%
which is the meristematic bits.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:10.820 align:middle line:90%


01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:13.236 align:middle line:90%
OK, what kind of tree is this?

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Spruce.

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Who said spruce?

01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to pick on you.

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Come over here.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.280 align:middle line:90%


01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Grab a needle.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.980 align:middle line:90%


01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
a good example.

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So the last pine
had two needles.

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:33.510 align:middle line:90%
This pine has five needles.

01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Count them up.

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:37.100 align:middle line:90%


01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.334 align:middle line:84%
This will be the
last one right here.

01:32:39.334 --> 01:32:40.308 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:32:40.308 --> 01:32:41.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

01:32:41.282 --> 01:32:42.082 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:32:42.082 --> 01:32:44.204 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe it.

01:32:44.204 --> 01:32:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sweet.

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, take a leaf,
pass it around.

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:52.188 align:middle line:90%
Here, we'll do this.

01:32:52.188 --> 01:32:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Take one, pass it around.

01:32:53.230 --> 01:32:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Take one, pass it around.

01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:59.513 align:middle line:90%


01:32:59.513 --> 01:33:00.930 align:middle line:84%
First, we're going
to do the test.

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Flip it over.

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.836 align:middle line:90%
Is this a dandelion?

01:33:04.836 --> 01:33:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably not.

01:33:06.330 --> 01:33:07.326 align:middle line:90%
>> It's smooth.

01:33:07.326 --> 01:33:09.318 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not that smooth.

01:33:09.318 --> 01:33:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It looks like it.

01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It looks like it.

01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Slimier.

01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we know that
it's not a dandelion?

01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not smooth.

01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's hairy.

01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's hairy.

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So this, in fact,
is not a dandelion.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a dandelion relative.

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is called cat's ears,
probably because it kind of

01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:30.990 align:middle line:90%
looks like a little cat ear.

01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:32.040 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly edible.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.620 align:middle line:84%
It has similar
properties to dandelion,

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:38.310 align:middle line:84%
which is that it's good for your
inner organs, your gallbladder,

01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:40.020 align:middle line:90%
pancreas, liver, kidneys.

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it's fuzzy, this one is
a better green to eat cooked.

01:33:43.570 --> 01:33:44.970 align:middle line:90%
It's much more pleasant.

01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So again, you throw it in
soups, in pastas, stir fry.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.565 align:middle line:84%
This is a great
green for stir fries.

01:33:50.565 --> 01:33:53.840 align:middle line:90%


01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.640 align:middle line:90%
How else?

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.530 align:middle line:90%
You could bake it.

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:56.800 align:middle line:90%
You could put it in lasagna.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
You could do whatever the
heck you want with it.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But this is a great green,
and it's literally everywhere

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:02.940 align:middle line:90%
into Tacoma.

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.607 align:middle line:84%
And the other identifying
characteristic

01:34:04.607 --> 01:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is it will develop
yellow flowers, kind

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.250 align:middle line:90%
of like a dandelion.

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But a dandelion has
one flower per stem,

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and cat's ears will have
multiple yellow flowers

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.920 align:middle line:90%
per stem.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I promised this
will be the last one.

01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:19.440 align:middle line:90%
This will be the last one.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's head back to Expand.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
If anybody wants to buy a
book, I have a couple of those.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.627 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I'll
answer questions.

01:34:25.627 --> 01:34:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And if people need
to go, they can go.

01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Or we can linger for a little
bit and talk more about plants.

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:48.000 align:middle line:90%
