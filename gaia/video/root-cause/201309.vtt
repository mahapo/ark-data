And I said, I'm
happy to do that,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
but let me just dig a
little bit about what

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%
could have happened to you.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I got back pain.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:90%
I went to an orthopedist.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The orthopedist said--
he did an MRI on my back.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
He said I had a herniated
disc, did surgery

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:90%
on me to remove the disc.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:84%
About six weeks
later, I was worse.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The orthopedic surgeon
did another MRI on me.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
He said the disc had moved
more, that I needed to have

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:90%
a laminectomy at two levels.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And he took me in, and he did
a laminectomy at L4 and L5.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Laminectomy means the back
half of the bones on the spine

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
are pulled off so that there's
more room for the discs

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:90%
and more room for the nerves.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
At which point I saw
her, and she was worse.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And what came up
on the examination

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that I did, that she had some
inflammation in her jaw bone.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you
have any dental work

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:90%
done prior to this back pain?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, come
to think of it, I did.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I had an infected tooth.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:90%
I had a root canal done.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:90%
The root canal failed.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I had another redo
of the root canal.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It also failed.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I had the root
canal tooth pulled,

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and I had a graft
put in there, and I

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:90%
had an implant put in there.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let's do an
experiment in the office.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I can inject a local
anesthetic on that tooth.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
If your back pain is
related to that tooth,

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and I block the nerve
coming from that tooth,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
it may make your back
pain feel better.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.622 align:middle line:84%
And that may be the
reason for your pain,

00:12:05.622 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
because after two
failed surgeries,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
another one, the chances of
it working aren't very good.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:90%
So she said, I'm in.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So I took some local anesthetic,
and I injected her tooth,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:90%
and I waited about 15 minutes.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
back into the room,

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.938 align:middle line:84%
she was standing
up going like this.

00:12:21.938 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, how does it feel?

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:90%
She says, it feels 90% gone.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, and probably this
is linked to that tooth.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.942 align:middle line:90%
I just want to make sure.

00:12:28.942 --> 00:12:31.358 align:middle line:84%
You come back in three days,
we're going to do this again.

00:12:31.358 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that
this just isn't a relief

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:90%
reaction, sort of a mental--

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
this is all psychosomatic,
and it's gone.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
We did it again, and
she said, it's gone.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back to
the oral surgeon

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to have him
take the darn implant out.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Within a couple of
weeks, her back pain,

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:52.398 align:middle line:84%
except for what was leftover
surgical trauma, was gone.

00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A root canal procedure
is still a very,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
very popular thing in dentistry
because no one wants to lose

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.950 align:middle line:90%
a tooth.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:10%
But more and more,
people are beginning

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:10%
to realize even from the current
day modern and very traditional

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.145 align:middle line:10%
literature that it's impossible
to sterilize a root canal

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:11.945 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:13:11.945 --> 00:13:14.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Most conventional dentists
believe there's no problem with

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:10%
them, but I personally
couldn't disagree more.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're are
hidden source of toxicity

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:90%
for almost anyone.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason that root canals
have an inherent problem is

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:10%
that because we know that
nowhere else in the body can we

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:10%
leave dead tissue.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere else in the
body-- your appendix dies,

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:84%
you have dead
tissue that doesn't

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
heal in any other
area of the body,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:84%
we know we have to
remove that because it's

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
a haven for bacteria, and it's
not compatible with health.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:90%
And the same is true in a tooth.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:90%
A tooth is a living structure.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It has a blood supply.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:90%
It has a nerve supply.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when a tooth
dies or becomes infected

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and we decide to go in
and do a root canal,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
even the best endodontist,
a root canal specialist,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
can do a great job at cleaning
out the main canal of any

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:90%
of the teeth.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.750 align:middle line:84%
But what they can't
get to are all

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:90%
of these thousands of tubules.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
You can see if you cut a tooth
in half or under a microscope,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
can see these thousands
of tubules that run out

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
in every different direction
at all sorts of angles

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:90%
off from the main canal.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Those microtubules are big
enough for bacteria to fit

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:10%
in, but not much else.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:10%
And the problem is if you've
got six to eight miles

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:10%
of microtubules in a single
tooth, it's impossible.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
You can see why it's impossible
to sterilize that tooth.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So after the root canal has
been performed, unfortunately,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
bacteria still reside
within the tooth.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have this
nice, warm, incubated tooth

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
where the bacteria
are able to flourish.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And now, there is no access from
the patient's own immune system

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:84%
to the tooth, because in the
process of doing the root canal

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
treatment, the blood
supply and the nerve

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
have been severed
from that tooth.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, the body can't deliver
its own immune defenses

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to help keep the
infection in check.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:10%
>> 70% to 90% of all medical
problems actually originate

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:10%
in the mouth.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Conventional dentistry
still has a focus

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
on the mechanistic
Newtonian mentality,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that the teeth are not connected
to the rest of the body.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, embryologically,
the teeth

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
developed from the
same tissues that

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
gives rise to your sympathetic
and the parasympathetic nervous

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
The blood supply in
the mouth literally

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:84%
will take any toxins
via the lymphatic system

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.948 align:middle line:84%
and take it down to the
thyroid, the thymus, the heart,

00:15:35.948 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the body.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.645 align:middle line:90%
So there is a direct connection.

00:15:38.645 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:10%
>> The teeth is not just
like a stone in the mouth.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:10%
It is extremely
densely connected.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
The pulp is extremely densely
connected to the lymph system,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:90%
to the autonomic nervous system.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
More than any other
organs, it's connected

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to the afferents, the sensitive
nerves to the brain directly

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and to all the region's systems.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Every tooth connects
up energetically through

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
the meridian system to
certain organs and glands.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So for example, on the
upper side of the jaw,

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
the last two molars
and this bicuspid

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
actually connect
up energetically

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:90%
to the left breast.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And on this side, it's
to the right breast.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And 95% of the time, women
who have breast cancer who

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
undergo a thermographic
study will

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
be found to have hot spots
in the jaw on the same side

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
as that malignant breast.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> 97% of our breast cancer
patients in an age between 30

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and 70, we tested
all these patients.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:53.955 align:middle line:84%
They had a root canal or a
toxic situation in the teeth.

00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The discussion of the
energetic relationship

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of the teeth to the rest of
the body is very interesting.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:10%
Every tooth lies a specific
acupuncture meridian

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:10%
and relates to certain
organs, and tissues,

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:10%
and vertebrae,
and muscle groups.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And so very often, you
see a direct relationship.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there
was a 19-year-old girl.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:84%
Her first year in
college, she had

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:90%
a root canal on a front tooth.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
That front tooth relates to
the kidney and the bladder.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
She started to have bladder
infections and kidney

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:90%
infections.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
She tried every treatment
known, and she was constantly

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
going on antibiotics,
and nothing helped.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
When she came to me, when
I tested that root canal,

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I saw the direct relationship
, and told the mother--

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.155 align:middle line:84%
and it was very hard, because
here you are a 19-year-old girl

00:17:47.155 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and it was her front tooth.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I
think in this case,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
really, the thing needs to be
done is to remove that tooth.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't
want to hear that,

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
so they went and tried
other treatments.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And then about
three months later,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
still suffering from
chronic kidney problems

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and urinary bladder problems,
she took the tooth out,

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.435 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
end of the problem.

00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember years ago
having a physician say,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I just can't buy into this
concept of this electricity

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:90%
going through these meridians.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a meridian
in all the cadaver

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:90%
labs I've ever been in.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, when you can
do an EKG on your cadaver,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll be able to
show you a meridian,

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
because you can't find it
when the person's dead.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at doing
an EEG, or an EMG, or an EKG,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at the electricity
going through the body,

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and that is
completely mainstream.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Each tooth actually lies
on a different meridian.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So those energy pathways
that we discussed, they

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:90%
go through particular areas.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking
at the wisdom teeth,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a small
intestine and a heart.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
As we move forward down the
top and we have these molars,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
then we're looking at breast,
we're looking at thyroid.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
On this side, we're
looking at pancreas.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:84%
On this side, we're
looking at spleen.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Then we move forward
to the bicuspids,

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and they're lung
and large intestine.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
We go to the eye
teeth, and it's called

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
an eye tooth for a
reason, because it's

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:90%
connected to your eye.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:84%
It's also connected to the
liver and to the gallbladder.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And then these four front
teeth top and bottom

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:84%
are connected to the urinary
tract, to the anal canal,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to the adrenals,
to the pituitary,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to your kidney,
everything that's

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:90%
related to that urinary tract.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I use a piece of equipment
that was originally

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
called EAV, electro
acupuncture according to Voll.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I put electricity into
the body, and then you

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:90%
gather data from that.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm testing
teeth, I actually

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
have the person holding
a bar in their hand.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And that bar is the
collection point.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And they touch a tooth and
put it in the circuitry.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I introduce,
by touching

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
on a particular
acupuncture point,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I introduce the
electricity into the body

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
to see if it can go all the
way through that meridian.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And you start seeing where
electricity is being blocked.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And now, you start asking
questions about the person's

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:90%
health, and they go, wow.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:90%
How did you know that?

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even tell you that
I was having problems there.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Because when the electricity
can't get through,

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:90%
it compromises that meridian.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people have trouble
getting their mind around

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
the fact that their teeth
are making them sick.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:10%
But let me just tell you
that a year or so ago,

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:10%
we looked at the last 60 cancer
patients that we had seen.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And 96% of them had
an infected tooth

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
in the same power supply serving
as their primary cancer, 96%.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I know this might
sound really funny to you,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.981 align:middle line:84%
but I've always wanted
to learn how to surf.

00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:57.234 align:middle line:84%
The sun, the spray, that
feeling of conquering a force

00:20:57.234 --> 00:20:59.639 align:middle line:90%
beyond your control.

00:20:59.639 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's symbolic.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Because after all my
trials and tribulations,

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I still felt like I'd just
drawn a bad lottery number.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:84%
You know you're sick
when you can miraculously

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:90%
attract a gorgeous girl.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
You're punching way
above your weight,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.662 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get it up.

00:21:20.662 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And I know every
guy will say this,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:90%
but it hasn't happened before.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Suffice to say, she
left pretty soon after.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
How was this journey
going to end?

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Would I reach the top of the
mountain, conquering everything

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:90%
that came before me?

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Would it be the death of me?

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I obsessed over these
questions and everything else.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Even friends and family,
they became less important.

the body would suggest ignoring

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:84%
it, and the same with
dental abscesses.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that they're
frequently asymptomatic.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Most people who come to see
me who have root canals,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.742 align:middle line:90%
they turn out to be infected.

00:22:30.742 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
But they're not coming
with a sore tooth.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Nobody comes to see
me with a sore tooth.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
They come with their arthritis,
their fatigue, their cancer,

their heart disease.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out when I get a
scan done of the root canal,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that there's bone being absorbed
because of chronic infection

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.400 align:middle line:90%
of the tooth.

believes that you should save

a tooth at all costs.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And if the patient
dies, well, that

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
was the price of
saving the tooth--

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
they don't really
come with the concept

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
that you should take things
that are dead out of the body.

I had family members who had

root canal treated teeth,
and I had done root canals,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:10%
because I was never taught to
question if residual infection

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:10%
was having any kind of negative
implication on the overall

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:10%
health of the patient.

research on root canal treated

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
teeth that clearly demonstrated
how toxic they were all

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of the time was the work
of Dr. Weston Price.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Weston Price, who did
25 years of research on root

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:10%
canals, found that they could
cause almost anything from

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:10%
mental disease, to heart
disease, to arthritis.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So when Weston Price started
doing root canals on his

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:84%
patients, he found that a lot
of them were getting sick.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And so he started
doing some research.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:90%
He'd take out the tooth.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
He would sterilize the tooth
on the outside, making sure

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that there was nothing
as far as bacteria,

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.030 align:middle line:84%
slip it under the skin of
a rabbit, and found out

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:06.521 align:middle line:84%
that the rabbit had whatever
disease the patient had.

00:24:06.521 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Who, let's say, had heart
disease, kidney disease,

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
arthritis, neurologic
disease, you name it.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And even more amazingly, he
would take that same tooth

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and successively put it
underneath the skin of 20, 30,

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
50 consecutive
rabbits, and they all

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
developed the same
medical syndrome

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
as the original person
who supplied that tooth.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was a direct
connection between

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
the pathogens of
these dead teeth,

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
the galvanic currents
between the different metals

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.025 align:middle line:90%
in the mouth.

00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example, we had
a patient with emphysema

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:90%
on steroids for over a year.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I tracked it down to a strep
infection in the jaw bone

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:84%
where he had a tooth
removed 15 years prior.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Once I got rid of the strep
infection in the jaw bone,

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
his emphysema
totally disappeared.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So the mouth is the
toxic waste dump

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that's impacting on
the rest of the body.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Dr. Price was a dentist,
and root canals had become

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:90%
posh.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Originally if you
were a poor person

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and you couldn't
afford dentistry,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:84%
then your teeth
would be taken out.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So when someone had money,
and they went to the dentist

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and said, gosh, I've just
kind of been neglectful.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I haven't gotten in.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if there's a
way you can save my tooth,

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
because if I open
and laugh, people

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
are going to think I'm poor,
because I don't have my teeth.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually more patient
driven that dentistry start

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
taxiderming teeth to keep
them in someone's mouth,

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and then put a nice
shiny gold crown on

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:84%
there so that when
they laughed, everybody

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:84%
thought they had money, because
you saw these gold teeth then.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately, the dental
schools look at the mouth

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:84%
as being a mannequin, and
that you can do any type

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
of procedure without any direct
impact on the rest of the body.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But this is the farthest
thing from the truth.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Data we've just recently
gotten shows now that

my fellow cardiologists,

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:10%

has a heart attack,

and they find the
cholesterol is OK.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:90%
The lipids are OK.

There's no risk factors.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And they might not use these
words with the patients,

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
tell you and they think,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.895 align:middle line:90%
that patient just had bad luck.

00:26:56.895 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of these things aren't
genetic problems, you know?

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.372 align:middle line:84%
why didn't more
people know about it?

00:31:54.372 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> About 95% of dentists have
X-ray equipment in their office

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:03.240 align:middle line:84%
which is only two-dimensional,
which means when they take

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the X-ray from here, they
can only see width and height

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:90%
on the tooth.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:90%
They can't see depth.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And you might take a picture
of a root canal tooth,

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.790 align:middle line:90%
and it looks fine.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you do another kind of
X-ray-- it's called cone beam.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.640 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a cat scan--

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:84%
where you can get a
three-dimensional view

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of that tooth, we very commonly
find that these root canal

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:84%
teeth are abscessed,
and there is

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:84%
an abscess sitting
around the tooth that

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.878 align:middle line:90%
isn't visible on the 2D X-ray.

00:32:35.878 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We were doing our
training, and I had a patient.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I had taken a cone
beam on, and she

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
was struggling with
some emotional problems,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and chronic fatigue, and
just a lot of things.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And we were reviewing her cone
beam with the technician, not

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:90%
a biological dentist.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.942 align:middle line:84%
Like, this as a technician
from the company.

00:32:53.942 --> 00:32:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
OK, let's just go

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.942 align:middle line:84%
to each one of the
root canal treated

00:32:56.942 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
teeth and kind of
flip this image

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and see if we see any pathology.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.830 align:middle line:10%
And so as we're flipping
through, he's like, oh, man.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:10%
These look terrible.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.700 align:middle line:10%
There's a cyst here,
and there's a cyst here.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I see root canals all the
time look great on an X-ray,

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:90%
but they do not test well.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.650 align:middle line:84%
They're a real problem
for the individual.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Every root canal tooth
contains dead tissue.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And dead tissue is a
haven for bacteria.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We analyzed 87 very well-done
root canal treated teeth,

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:84%
many of them by endodontists and
many more by general dentists.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was that regardless

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.620 align:middle line:84%
of how well the root
canal was performed,

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:84%
by far the vast majority had
a higher degree of toxicity.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:84%
There was not one of those
87 that was non-toxic.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.310 align:middle line:84%
The toxins are oftentimes
the waste material

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.930 align:middle line:90%
from the bacteria.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:84%
They can be also just
portions, for example,

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of the cell wall of a bacteria.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, they're the
waste material of the bacteria.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps one of the
world's leading authorities

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:10%
on biological toxins is
Boyd Haley at the University

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.179 align:middle line:10%
of Kentucky.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
What Dr. Haley
found and published

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:84%
is that the toxins
from a root canal tooth

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.370 align:middle line:84%
are equal in toxicity
to the standard

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.550 align:middle line:84%
by which all biological
toxins are majored,

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.679 align:middle line:90%
namely hydrogen sulfide.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.739 align:middle line:84%
He also found that the toxins
from a root canal tooth

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:30.760 align:middle line:84%
are equal in toxicity
to botulism poisoning.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:84%
As you know, that's one of the
worst that we know about here.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> All root canals are
infected without any exception.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a big study done by
an American holistic dentist

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Very officially, they tested
30,000, three-zero thousand--

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:84%
root canals extracted
over the years,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:58.286 align:middle line:84%
and they were all infected
without any exception.

00:34:58.286 --> 00:35:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> There used to be a laboratory
at the University of Kentucky.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.220 align:middle line:84%
It was called Affinity
Labeling Technologies.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.613 align:middle line:84%
It was a laboratory
from Dr. Boyd

00:35:04.613 --> 00:35:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Haley, who was the chairman
of the department of chemistry

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And he set up a lab test
where you could stick a cotton

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:84%
pledget-- it was sort
of a hard cotton thing--

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.840 align:middle line:84%
underneath a tooth that
you suspected as being bad,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and you shoved it underneath
the gum, pulled it out,

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and then you'd have
a sample of fluid.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And the samples would
go their laboratory,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and what they would
do is a bioassay

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
to find was there
toxic material coming

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.780 align:middle line:90%
from the root of the tooth?

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And this laboratory
doesn't exist anymore.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.323 align:middle line:84%
But I have an old
report from a patient.

00:35:38.323 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:84%
This was a patient
with chronic fatigue.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.050 align:middle line:90%
He came to me.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
When I examined him
I thought, gee, I

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:84%
think your problem is a
toxic root canal tooth.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Go to the dentist.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Have this test done.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.710 align:middle line:84%
He went and had the
test done, and these

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.270 align:middle line:90%
are the results of the test.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the test
looks at is these

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
are six enzymes which
are part of what's

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.530 align:middle line:90%
called the Krebs cycle.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:03.220 align:middle line:84%
These are the energy
producing part of the cell.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And these enzymes are able
to take a sugar molecule

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:90%
and get the energy out of it.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:84%
If these enzymes are
blocked, then that cell

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:90%
can't make energy.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And what bio toxins do is
they block these enzymes

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:18.820 align:middle line:90%
from working.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
is took the stuff

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.500 align:middle line:84%
from the tooth, the bad
tooth and the good tooth,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and they incubated it
with these enzymes.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
measurement system

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:84%
where they say, how bad
was that enzyme blocked?

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular
patient, the average

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:40.300 align:middle line:84%
was 93% inhibition, which
is blocking of that enzyme.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And by coordinating with
dentists around the country,

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.430 align:middle line:84%
over 5,000 extracted root canal
treated teeth were submitted

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.770 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Haley for testing.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:90%
100% of them were toxic.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And just to make sure this
wasn't something they just

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the
tooth or the mouth,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.140 align:middle line:84%
they also submitted some
teeth that were extracted

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:90%
for orthodontic purposes.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
normal teeth, but they

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:84%
needed to let the
other teeth grow in.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
None of these teeth inhibited
any of these enzymes.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:84%
This was finally
the smoking gun.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:84%
This was cause and effect that
the root canal simply cannot be

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:90%
sterilized inside the mouth.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be put into a
situation where the infection

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:84%
inside the root canal
could ever be resolved.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not sensed locally
because the tooth when you root

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
canal it, you disconnect from
the nerve so that it's no more

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:84%
sensitivity, so the patient
can't feel the toxic effect,

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.380 align:middle line:90%
can't feel this.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the amazing
things is when people come

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.730 align:middle line:84%
into the office and I say, I'm
going to tell you what's going

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:50.200 align:middle line:90%
on with you.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.633 align:middle line:90%
You have insomnia.

00:37:51.633 --> 00:37:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You have trouble
with your memory.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.175 align:middle line:90%
You can't deal with stress.

00:37:54.175 --> 00:37:58.235 align:middle line:84%
You can't deal with stimulus,
and I go down this list.

00:37:58.235 --> 00:38:01.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times they start
crying, because usually

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm the first physician
who has described

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:84%
to them without them telling me
what's going on in their life.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Because all the other physicians
they've seen have just said,

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.387 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's all in your mind.

00:38:11.387 --> 00:38:13.765 align:middle line:84%
Here, take these antidepressants
and you'll be fine.

00:38:13.765 --> 00:38:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The root canal
specialists want to protect

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:90%
their procedure, OK?

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
try to reassure people

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.313 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what their intent is.

00:38:25.313 --> 00:38:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to say they're
not interested in the health

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:90%
and welfare of their patients.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But they truly believe the
root canal procedure is fine.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.930 align:middle line:90%
It does a good job.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And they don't believe that
it's chronically infected.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:84%
But the scientific evidence
takes this out of belief range,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Belief has nothing
to do with it.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It's-- science shows the root
canal is always infected,

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and the only differentiation
is somewhere a little bit more

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:56.294 align:middle line:84%
toxic and more infected
than the other ones.

a dentist when I grew up.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And he'd pat my head
and say, fine, fine.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Only he never told me how
hard it was to become one.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:90%
When I was older, I learned.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:84%
He went to college
for eight years

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and had to study dozens
of subjects-- not just

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:53.222 align:middle line:84%
dental ones, but physiology,
and anatomy, and bacteriology.

00:40:24.218 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I found out that in America,
about 25 million new root canal

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:90%
procedures are done each year.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And while this did
alarm me, what it really

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.600 align:middle line:90%
made me wonder was, why me?

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:43.005 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't all these people have
root canal problems like I did?

00:40:43.005 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So oftentimes I'm asked,
why would a root canal have

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.420 align:middle line:84%
a systemic health impact
on one person and maybe not

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.780 align:middle line:90%
on another?

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
is because we're all

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.830 align:middle line:84%
susceptible to toxicities
in different ranges.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:84%
As you know, there
are some people

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:84%
who can tolerate cigarette
smoking, for example,

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.900 align:middle line:84%
for 60 or 70 years and have
no apparent ill effects.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet there are people who
can smoke for a year or two

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.435 align:middle line:90%
and develop a carcinoma.

00:41:12.435 --> 00:41:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone processes
toxins differently.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.120 align:middle line:10%
So there are some
patients who are

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.970 align:middle line:10%
able to handle a root
canal treated tooth,

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.880 align:middle line:10%
and their immune system
isn't overloaded by that.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Yet there are other
patients we find

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.180 align:middle line:84%
who just one root canal
has a dramatic effect

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.740 align:middle line:90%
on their immune system.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The practice that I have
is a very selective practice.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.610 align:middle line:10%
Most of the people we see
have chronic serious illness.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, probably in the
general population,

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
these aren't diagnosed
because the guy who's

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.060 align:middle line:84%
seeing the patient
for high blood

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:84%
pressure, for chronic back
pain, is not associating it

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and he's not testing,
could this be

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:90%
a dental issue that's referred?

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's very important that
dentistry and medicine get

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.830 align:middle line:10%
together.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:10%
It's important
that physicians are

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.770 align:middle line:10%
as aware of the
importance of the mouth

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.080 align:middle line:10%
as it is for the
dentist to realize

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.250 align:middle line:10%
that some of the procedures
that he or she does in the mouth

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:10.860 align:middle line:10%
severely and strongly impact
the health of the body.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Perfect example, we had a
patient referred to us who had

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.600 align:middle line:90%
stage four throat cancer.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line was he
had two root canal teeth.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.585 align:middle line:10%
The radiographs looked pristine,
and a thousand dentists

00:42:23.585 --> 00:42:26.390 align:middle line:10%
that would view them would say,
these are absolutely normal.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.920 align:middle line:10%
The pathogens that were in
these two root canal teeth

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.380 align:middle line:10%
were in his throat exactly
where the cancer was.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I extracted the two teeth.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:38.220 align:middle line:84%
We ozonated the jawbone,
homeopathics and ionic silver.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:84%
In three weeks, the
stage four throat cancer

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:44.880 align:middle line:84%
was totally resolved, documented
with pet scans, blood tests,

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.200 align:middle line:90%
and visual.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the impact of
toxic root canal teeth.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.610 align:middle line:10%
>> There was one relation
study between diseases and root

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:59.370 align:middle line:10%
canals published in a very
prestigious oncology newspaper

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:10%
in the United States which
showed that 90% of all

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:10%
the prostate cancer, they
contained in its needs tissue

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:10%
the cancerogenic bacteria
which come from root canal.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:19.800 align:middle line:10%
>> I felt bad because I
had done a lot of those,

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.295 align:middle line:10%
and I actually had thought at
one point that that's what I

00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:23.670 align:middle line:10%
wanted to do the
rest of my life.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:90%
I thought, how can this be?

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.170 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
been going on for so long.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
specialty around it.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But whenever colleagues
started presenting me

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.490 align:middle line:84%
with different
pieces of research,

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I obviously came
to the conclusion

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that I did not want to do
root canal treatment anymore

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I could not confidently
say that I was not

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:90%
doing harm in some situations.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The bottom line is
when you do a root canal,

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.050 align:middle line:84%
it cuts the flow of energy to
these different organs and can

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.850 align:middle line:90%
affect them.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't get rid of an
infection unless you have

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:84%
a viable immune system
with complete access to all

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.880 align:middle line:90%
the parts that are infected.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is uniformly eliminated
when a root canal is done.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The analogy that I
like to use, in my office,

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.870 align:middle line:10%
there is a sliding door.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:10%
You are on one side of the
door with the door closed,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:10%
and you have Christmas
lights in your hand.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You want to know if all
the lights light up.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I am on the other side
of the sliding door,

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and I have an extension
cord plugged in ready to go.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But you and I are
hitting the door.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.360 align:middle line:90%
We can't connect.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So if someone comes by and they
start standing on the door,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.660 align:middle line:84%
how much of the
door has to be gone

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.610 align:middle line:90%
before you and I can connect?

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Not a thin piece of
balsa wood, all of it.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Once all of the door is
removed, then you and I

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.870 align:middle line:84%
are able to make a connection,
just like the body does.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It totally reconnects, and
the electricity goes through.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> After everything
that I'd uncovered,

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.540 align:middle line:90%
I knew my teeth had to come out.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I saw a biological dentist,
and the first thing he spotted

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.050 align:middle line:90%
was--

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:02.685 align:middle line:84%
>> So it looks like you've
got some trauma to your front

00:45:02.685 --> 00:45:03.485 align:middle line:90%
tooth.

00:45:03.485 --> 00:45:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, that punch in the mouth.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.145 align:middle line:84%
Why was I such a sucker
for a damsel in distress?

00:45:08.145 --> 00:45:12.936 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.936 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's have a
look at the X-ray here.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:10%
And all this discoloration
is where the infection is.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:10%
So we've got a deep
pocket infection up top,

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.360 align:middle line:10%
and that's what's been
causing the health issues.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.443 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to extract
the root canal tooth.

00:45:25.443 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And with a dental
bur, we're going

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to remove the periodontal
ligament down to the bone.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll give you a
new tooth, a zirconian tooth.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.110 align:middle line:10%
And we'll bridge
it to either side.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:10%
So in the next three
or four months,

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.648 align:middle line:10%
this will heal up
nicely and you'll

00:45:38.648 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:10%
notice a dramatic increase
in your energy levels.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Any questions?

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.727 align:middle line:90%

up with boundless energy.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:84%

if you have a root canal,

and you're convinced of the
information I'm talking about

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and the science behind
it, you want to get it out

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.600 align:middle line:84%
of your body, you want to have
it stop negatively impacting

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:27.330 align:middle line:84%
your health, well, you need to
find a dentist who knows what

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.440 align:middle line:84%
he or she is doing, because
it involves more than a simple

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.430 align:middle line:90%
extraction.

the bacteria and the toxins

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.030 align:middle line:90%
go into these bones, too.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:58.555 align:middle line:84%
This has to be drained
and treated, too.

>> And this is where I also
find ozone gas so indispensable,

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.910 align:middle line:10%
because you can just punch
with a very tiny needle.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:10.290 align:middle line:84%
You go into the area, and
then you inject ozone gas.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And that gas will go
off into all the areas

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:18.408 align:middle line:84%
off this main tunnel, all the
areas where we have infection.

treatment goes on with the gas,

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.970 align:middle line:84%
they feel that that area
where it's going off into

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:45.945 align:middle line:90%
is shrinking.

00:47:45.945 --> 00:47:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> This jawbone area has a
very dense nerve network.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:53.550 align:middle line:84%
These nerves don't
relay, you know?

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not like here
goes to the spinal cord

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.120 align:middle line:90%
goes somewhere else.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.780 align:middle line:84%
These nerves go right into
the middle of the brain

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.090 align:middle line:84%
where the regulation of
the nervous system occurs.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.800 align:middle line:90%
They're called cranial nerves.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.732 align:middle line:84%
This cranial nerve is the
biggest one in the body,

00:48:07.732 --> 00:48:08.940 align:middle line:90%
and it goes right into there.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very delicate
and protected area.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So if someone has a chronic
smoldering infection

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.310 align:middle line:84%
with biotoxin in
this area, it can

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:20.870 align:middle line:84%
affect the brain, the regulation
of the brain, their energy,

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.105 align:middle line:90%
and lots of other things.

00:48:22.105 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, we had
a woman with so-called

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Hashimoto's disease,
an autoimmune problem,

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and it was coming from a
cytomegalovirus from a third

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.290 align:middle line:84%
molar extraction site in the
jawbone plus nickel ions from

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.450 align:middle line:90%
an orthodontic retaining wire.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Once those two
substances were removed

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.660 align:middle line:84%
from the thyroid
and the sources,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.900 align:middle line:84%
the Hashimoto's
totally disappeared.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So autoimmune problems
are there for a reason.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't attack
itself for no reason.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.180 align:middle line:84%
There's something there
that's causing that reaction.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So the doctor has
to be alert to this,

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.750 align:middle line:84%
because if he wants cures,
especially with cancer,

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.070 align:middle line:90%
you've got to address these.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.140 align:middle line:84%
They're big stressors
on the body,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and they take a lot
of immune attention.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And if the immune
system's like, don't

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.730 align:middle line:84%
let the toxin get into
the brain and kill me,

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:11.860 align:middle line:84%
it's letting the cancer cells
go here, or men in the prostate,

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.540 align:middle line:90%
or in the colon--

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.130 align:middle line:90%
the big ones-- or in the lung.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:16.835 align:middle line:90%
These are the four big cancers.

00:49:16.835 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Your chance for cancer
is significantly increased,

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's just spreading out of
the ignorance of the so-called

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:84%
specialists that they don't
want to accept this fact,

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.970 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
absolutely clearly proven.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.660 align:middle line:10%
>> So in doing the
testing of the bacteria,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:43.480 align:middle line:10%
we found that there are in root
canals, 53 different bacteria.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.720 align:middle line:84%
28 of them are directly involved
with the health of the heart,

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.180 align:middle line:84%
that they are known from
the scientific literature

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.190 align:middle line:84%
to create certain
heart conditions.

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of them specialize in
attacking the heart valve.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Many of them cause what's called
endocarditis, inflammation

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.975 align:middle line:90%
of the vessels inside the heart.

00:50:04.975 --> 00:50:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And we now have studies from
the Journal of the American

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:14.110 align:middle line:84%
dental association that show
that when you have one or more

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:17.410 align:middle line:84%
root canals in your mouth,
statistically speaking,

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.990 align:middle line:84%
you have a greater chance of
heart attack, plain and simple.

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:10%
>> We know with increasing
evidence that the cause

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.440 align:middle line:10%
of coronary artery
disease is inflammation

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.410 align:middle line:10%
of the endothelial, the lining
of the blood vessel wall.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:33.310 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do in medicine
is work out what is inflaming

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.418 align:middle line:90%
the wall of the artery?

00:50:34.418 --> 00:50:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately what
the body does is the body

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.480 align:middle line:84%
tries to seal off
the inflammation.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.240 align:middle line:90%
The body uses cholesterol.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It uses calcium to seal
off that inflammation.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:84%
You're getting what's called
a plaque, the same plaques

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that we get on our
teeth, which is basically

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.040 align:middle line:84%
bacteria covered by a
biofilm, then covered

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.510 align:middle line:90%
by layer of calcium.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.340 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what we're
seeing in coronary arteries.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So the trick is not
to try and get rid

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.680 align:middle line:84%
of that cholesterol,
which is going there.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It's been put there by
the body to protect us

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:02.150 align:middle line:90%
against the inflammation.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:04.210 align:middle line:84%
The trick is to try and
work out what is causing

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:06.010 align:middle line:90%
the underlying inflammation.

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Dental infections are a big part
of that because of the sending

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:13.345 align:middle line:84%
of bacteria from the mouth
straight into the bloodstream

00:51:13.345 --> 00:51:14.470 align:middle line:90%
into the coronary arteries.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:16.246 align:middle line:90%

can occur in a person,

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:23.193 align:middle line:84%
and it can be undone if it's
done properly by a doctor who

00:51:23.193 --> 00:51:24.235 align:middle line:90%

00:51:24.235 --> 00:51:31.060 align:middle line:84%

organic toxins where we can see

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:84%
if the body is, so to say,
impregnated by these dental

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.930 align:middle line:84%
toxins which come
from the root canals.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.350 align:middle line:90%
We can measure these.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We called them axonal hormones,
cancerogenic substances which

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:90%
are organic molecules.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Once we have the basic
toxic source removed from

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:53.870 align:middle line:84%
the patient, then things
like infrared sauna is good.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:54.950 align:middle line:90%
You'll sweat.

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.740 align:middle line:84%
There's nutritional agents
that we can give you.

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And we can tease these things
out of you and get them out.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Then, our basic
program is we find out

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.790 align:middle line:84%
what nutrients they're missing,
and we give it back to them.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Some of it's oral supplements.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Some of it's done intravenously.

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:14.140 align:middle line:84%
We do IV vitamin C. We
use pulse magnetic fields,

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:17.110 align:middle line:84%
because in cells that
don't make energy,

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.450 align:middle line:84%
those cells don't have
energy, and the membrane

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:22.570 align:middle line:84%
around the cell can't control
very well what goes in and out.

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.480 align:middle line:84%
If we put them in an environment
where there's a gentle pulse

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.010 align:middle line:84%
magnetic field, it recharges
that cell membrane.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, that cell can
detoxify itself.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:34.250 align:middle line:84%
In over three to six months,
sometimes a little bit longer,

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:90%
we can get these things out.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You can get your levels
down to where they're safer,

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and then we can help
you restore your health.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I was starting to feel great,
so I went to an EAV machine

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.380 align:middle line:84%
operator to make sure my
energy flow was on track.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.420 align:middle line:90%
But something was off.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I found I had another blockage,
this time in one of my wisdom

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:54.250 align:middle line:90%
teeth.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I dug deeper and got
a cone beam scan.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I was told it was a cavitation,
something else you really

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.600 align:middle line:90%
don't want.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Just my luck.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I had to get that
sorted out now as well.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Step one was actually finding
out what a cavitation is.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Cavitations are basically
residual infections

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:18.280 align:middle line:84%
in the jawbone which result
from extraction of teeth.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.020 align:middle line:84%
If the extraction site
is not meticulously

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.730 align:middle line:84%
curetted and
cleansed, the bacteria

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:25.933 align:middle line:84%
just infiltrate into
that wound and live there

00:53:25.933 --> 00:53:27.600 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the
life of the patient.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Every bone in your body
is connected to another bone

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:32.760 align:middle line:90%
by way of a ligament.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Your tooth is connected
to your jaw bone

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.895 align:middle line:84%
by way of what we call
a periodontal ligament.

00:53:38.895 --> 00:53:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> If a tooth is properly
pulled, when the tooth is out,

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.800 align:middle line:84%
the dentist will also
take out that ligament.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And if that ligament
is gone, that bone

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.220 align:middle line:84%
will heal in so that
there is full bone,

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.090 align:middle line:90%
and you have a restored jawbone.

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But if the doctor
pulls that tooth

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't take
out that ligament,

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:84%
that space where that tooth
was may seal over on the top

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.060 align:middle line:90%
and be a cavity.

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So that periodontal
ligament staying in the socket,

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:84%
it prevents communication from
the body being able to send

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.460 align:middle line:84%
the osteoblast and the
osteoclast to that extraction

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.530 align:middle line:84%
site and fill in
with healthy bone.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a barrier.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And it will be a place
where the body then will use

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:31.150 align:middle line:84%
as a storage depot for junk,
toxic junk, bacteria, funguses.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And it won't hurt.

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:36.120 align:middle line:84%
It may not be completely
visible on a regular X-ray,

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.710 align:middle line:90%
but it is sitting there.

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So the periodontal
ligament prevents healing.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.040 align:middle line:84%
One actual study on
the 5,000 cavitations

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:52.450 align:middle line:84%
left after wisdom teeth were
removed, 4,999 had not healed.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Only one in 5,000 had healed.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:59.418 align:middle line:84%
>> The majority of people
in the United States

00:54:59.418 --> 00:55:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and in the developed countries
around the world that have had

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:06.550 align:middle line:84%
extracted teeth for any
reason also have cavitations.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's inside that
hole is nothing different--

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and this sounds disgusting, and
it sounds like an exaggeration,

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.920 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the same as wet
infectious gangrene.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> These cavitations
in the jaw bone,

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:26.590 align:middle line:84%
they can create
significant diseases,

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:32.095 align:middle line:84%
significant neurological
diseases like, for example, MS.

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:35.952 align:middle line:84%
>> That cavitation can
occur from different things.

00:55:35.952 --> 00:55:38.160 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a person could
have a clotting disease,

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.320 align:middle line:84%
or they could have had a
football injury, something

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that made the bone
not be healthy

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.550 align:middle line:90%
in that particular area.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:49.570 align:middle line:84%
The most common reason is
that the tooth was removed

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and the periodontal
ligament was not taken out.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that void of
where the tooth was never

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.970 align:middle line:84%
did fill in appropriately
with healthy bone.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:00.940 align:middle line:84%
The second most common reason
is that that bacteria that's

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:05.170 align:middle line:84%
in a root canal tooth
will find a microfracture

00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:08.680 align:middle line:84%
through that particular root
surface and kind of worm hole

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.260 align:middle line:84%
through the bone
and create a void.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not uncommon
for a cavitation

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.700 align:middle line:90%
to occur next to a root canal.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The most common spots
are the wisdom teeth.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:23.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The wisdom teeth are unique
in that there are four circuits

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.190 align:middle line:10%
going through it
instead of just two.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.900 align:middle line:10%
It's heart, small intestine,
and the sympathetic and

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.910 align:middle line:10%
parasympathetic systems.

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you see people whose
adrenal glands are not working.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they have
infection where their wisdom

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.520 align:middle line:90%
teeth were taken out.

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.645 align:middle line:10%
Because you're going to
have infections in the bone

00:56:41.645 --> 00:56:44.680 align:middle line:10%
where your wisdom teeth
were taken off for 50 years,

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.230 align:middle line:10%
and essentially
have no pain there,

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.727 align:middle line:10%
but it completely
destroys your life.

00:56:49.727 --> 00:56:51.310 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have
enough adrenaline,

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.140 align:middle line:90%
you have trouble going to sleep.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:57.488 align:middle line:84%
And then you have trouble
dealing with stress.

00:56:57.488 --> 00:56:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets to where
you can't stand any stimulus,

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.540 align:middle line:90%
so you don't like loud music.

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.220 align:middle line:90%
You don't like loud noises.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't be around
a rowdy crowd.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:08.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't be around
people who are arguing.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I just
described as a person

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:11.555 align:middle line:90%
whose life's in the toilet.

00:57:11.555 --> 00:57:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> For instance, I myself had
my wisdom teeth out when I was

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.110 align:middle line:90%
in dental school.

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:23.200 align:middle line:84%
About 30 years later, I
developed a heart arrhythmia.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.110 align:middle line:90%
And nothing seemed to help it.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I would take
intravenous vitamins.

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:29.145 align:middle line:90%
I tried homeopathics.

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was doing it.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.853 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
I said, wait a minute.

00:57:31.853 --> 00:57:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Let me check see if
I have a cavitation.

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:38.500 align:middle line:84%
That wisdom tooth which is on
the heart meridian, you see,

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.606 align:middle line:90%
was causing the problem.

00:57:40.606 --> 00:57:45.970 align:middle line:10%
>> If you can get a good
normal 3D cone beam X-ray

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:49.750 align:middle line:10%
of your jawbone, then you do
have a much higher reassurance

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:53.320 align:middle line:10%
that you don't have this
cavitation process going

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.536 align:middle line:10%
on inside the jawbone as well.

00:57:55.536 --> 00:57:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And if the
dentist unroofs that,

00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and scoops that stuff out, and
then removes that ligament,

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:04.975 align:middle line:84%
and then that heals, that
patient can get well.

00:58:04.975 --> 00:58:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the questions
that we get is,

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:11.800 align:middle line:84%
are there things I can do prior
to my procedure to increase

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.950 align:middle line:84%
my ability to heal properly
from a surgical procedure like

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:19.090 align:middle line:84%
a cavitation or from
a root canal removal?

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:21.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
things that you can do

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.450 align:middle line:84%
is to have proper nutrition,
be eating a clean diet,

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:28.045 align:middle line:84%
be getting enough proteins and
enough vitamins and minerals.

00:58:28.045 --> 00:58:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When that tooth comes out,
you want to make sure that

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:33.835 align:middle line:84%
the socket is cleaned
out really well.

00:58:33.835 --> 00:58:35.710 align:middle line:84%
You want to remove that
periodontal ligament.

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:38.620 align:middle line:84%
If there's infection, you want
to get rid of the infection.

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And then you let it heal.

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I like to let the body fill it
in with its own natural bone.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to wait at least
three months for that.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.170 align:middle line:10%
You want to check it and
make sure that it did heal,

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:51.270 align:middle line:10%
and you don't have cavitation.

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:52.532 align:middle line:90%
But let's say it's healed.

00:58:52.532 --> 00:58:53.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you replace the tooth?

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have
different options.

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, an option is
you don't replace it.

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.680 align:middle line:90%
You leave it alone.

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Another option is you can use
something removable, which

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.560 align:middle line:90%
most people don't like.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not very comfortable.

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The other option is you
could put a bridge in, where

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.110 align:middle line:90%
you're bridging that space.

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
types of bridges.

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:14.710 align:middle line:84%
The traditional bridge,
which I don't like,

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:17.650 align:middle line:84%
is where you have to
mutilate the teeth

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:21.610 align:middle line:84%
on either side of that space
to hold the missing tooth.

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:25.627 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with that is
when you mutilate those teeth,

00:59:25.627 --> 00:59:28.210 align:middle line:84%
you increase the odds that those
teeth could need a root canal

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:29.540 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So I prefer to use a
bonded type bridge,

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:35.910 align:middle line:84%
where the abutment
teeth as they're called,

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:40.240 align:middle line:84%
or the supporting teeth,
have minimal preparation,

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and that holds
the missing tooth.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only downside
with that really

00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:84%
is that it periodically
will come loose and need

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.640 align:middle line:90%
to be recemented.

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, of course, the best
option is to take really good

00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:56.230 align:middle line:84%
care of our teeth and gums with
a comprehensive dental program

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:57.610 align:middle line:90%
so we never need a root canal.

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But let's say that
hasn't happened, like me

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
people I know.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there was
trauma involved,

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.590 align:middle line:90%
and you didn't get an option.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't really walk
around with no front teeth.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not very good for business.

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to have
some sort of bridge?

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to have
some sort of implant?

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> An implant is where
you're going into the bone

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're placing what
traditionally has been

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.070 align:middle line:90%
a titanium implant.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, today, we have
also ceramic implants.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.430 align:middle line:84%
The advantages
and disadvantages,

01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
well, titanium, the
problem is you're

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:34.015 align:middle line:90%
putting a metal into the bone.

01:00:34.015 --> 01:00:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Titanium itself
is known as a hapten.

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
It means the ions
in the titanium

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:43.710 align:middle line:90%
itself can trigger autoimmune.

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you are genetically
predisposed to something

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
like Hashimoto's, celiacs,
scleroderma, lupus,

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
rheumatoid arthritis,
it might get turned on.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And even if that
implant is removed,

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
the trigger's
already been pulled.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So now, you've got problems
that you didn't have.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I've got metal
that is directly

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:06.080 align:middle line:90%
going into my meridian system.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's like sticking a
spoon in an electric socket,

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and bending it around, and
sticking it in the bottom part.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And it shorts out
the whole meridian.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.425 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're finding is
that many physicians that are

01:01:16.425 --> 01:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
referring their patients here,
and also patients that are

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.050 align:middle line:84%
doing their own research,
are desiring to have no metal

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:22.850 align:middle line:90%
in their mouth.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
They want to eliminate anything
that could create a current.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we now have
zirconia implants, which

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.970 align:middle line:90%
it's more like a ceramic.

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete
non-metal implant

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that looks the same as a
titanium implant and functions

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
the same, but is considered
much more biocompatible

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.905 align:middle line:84%
for the tissue and
for the patient.

01:01:43.905 --> 01:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And it interferes
with stability much,

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
much less than
titanium implants.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I do not say zirconia
implants are 100% good.

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But they are much better,
tolerable to the body

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.315 align:middle line:90%
than titanium implants are.

01:02:02.315 --> 01:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So good medicine
would include this,

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we want to do.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.760 align:middle line:90%
We want just the best medicine.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
We want to give people
things that don't hurt them

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:12.290 align:middle line:90%
more than they help them.

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:16.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Root canals are probably one
of the most pernicious, toxic,

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.610 align:middle line:10%
hidden influences
on your health.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you're struggling to
understand why you're so sick

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and you have
multiple root canals,

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.015 align:middle line:90%
please examine that issue.

01:02:29.015 --> 01:02:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I don't want you
to think that I had my head

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
in the clouds by saying that
the only reason I got chronic

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
fatigue was because
I had a root canal.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
My search has led me to believe
that all chronic disease is

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
because of a toxic overload.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
These toxins come
in various forms,

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
from as simple as toxic junk
food, to environmental toxins,

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.530 align:middle line:90%
to toxic emotions.

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all now learning
about the toxic effects

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic
frequencies as well.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And we also can't

Firstly, if the tooth
needs to be removed,

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
make sure you see a
holistic dentist, one

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%

you have three good options.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Your first option is to get
a bonded ceramic bridge.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Your second option is to
get a zirconia implant.

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, 99% of dentists will
recommend the titanium implant,

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
but that is just as
bad as a root canal.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So make sure your
implant is a zirconia.
