00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.757 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to play just as
long as I'm able to play.

00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:48.215 align:middle line:10%
Lot of people say,
oh, I can't play

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.589 align:middle line:10%
because I've got arthritis
and this, that, and the other.

when you reach 70 years old,

you're not supposed to be
running up and down the court,

don't you go play with them?

You always come to my games.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.632 align:middle line:90%

>> You know, we've been
competitive all our lives.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a competitive person.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:10%
And I think you either
are or you're not.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.058 align:middle line:10%
And the girls on the team are.

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:38.429 align:middle line:10%
And I want to win.

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:10%
I don't care what
it is I'm playing.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:10%
My objective is to win.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.386 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I'll die with
that competitive spirit.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:90%
We want to medal.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.208 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's all
about, medaling, OK?

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:08.196 align:middle line:90%

We played a lot of games

on until I'm 100.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I want to win one more
nationals anyway, before I quit.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Several of us played very
competitive basketball when we

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:10%
were high school age.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> This is back in the days when
you had three guards and three

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
forwards up here and
you didn't cross over.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Girls weren't able to
play like the boys.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:10%
>> But this three on three
half-court was an entirely

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:10%
different experience, because
now you're not a guard

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:10%
or a forward.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:10%
You're everything.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Twig coached us
for a long time.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Sarah's Twig's wife,
so right from the start it was

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.795 align:middle line:10%
always interesting when she and
Twig would get fussing about

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:07.595 align:middle line:10%
something.

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> He would say, y'all just
can't do anything right.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'd try to say,
Twig, we went for years

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:90%
and didn't play organized ball.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:90%
You've played it all your life.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
He knows more little things
than I will ever learn.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I never was taught how to
screen and roll in high school,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:90%
so it's hard on me to do that.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying my best
to do it, but it's

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:84%
hard to learn it
when we get our age.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Liz is our little run
around on your own deal.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You design plays
and sometimes Liz

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.681 align:middle line:84%
forgets about the
design or the play.

00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:48.375 align:middle line:84%
And she's fast enough
that she overcomes that.

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe someday I'll learn how
to play this basketball game.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.251 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to doubt it,
but don't have much more time.

00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:57.197 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.197 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We had one lady
to tell us one year--

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:90%
she called time out.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we
are grandmothers.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:10%
What are you doing?

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And we go, we're
grandmothers too.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:10%
She just thought you
shouldn't touch them.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's
surprisingly physical.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the big
differences from when

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:90%
we played when we were younger.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
When we were younger, if
you just touched somebody

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
like that it was a foul.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Now you're lucky if you don't
get knocked across the floor.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I've had two episodes
of broken ribs.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I have not really
suffered any injury,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:90%
except a multitude of bruises.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've had them
all over my body.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I split my eye open.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Fell right here on my face,
got a split in the eye,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
pushed all my teeth to one side.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:84%
This happened here in a
practice, so I got up,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
called the house, told my
husband to call the dentist,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:90%
say I'm on my way.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And on the way over, I
was pushing my teeth back

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to get them
straightened out again.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And I had a pretty good job.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.291 align:middle line:84%
I had pretty much had
them straightened out

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
by the time I got there.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:90%
But you know, part of the game.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to
defend yourself.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, somebody else is
going to push you around, so--

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
you might not
always instigate it,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to protect
yourself if they do.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had to change a few
things because of my heart.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.912 align:middle line:84%
If I use my left arm, jerk
my left arm in the wrong way,

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:90%
it'll get out of rhythm.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, when
it gets out of rhythm,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
if I don't stop and
if I don't give it

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
time to get back into rhythm,
in fact I will pass out.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
If I quit as soon as I can feel
it, then I most of the time

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:90%
can get it back on its rhythm.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I have to
go out of the gym,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:90%
not hear that ball bouncing.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It leaves you weak, kind of.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I had that
problem in high school.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
But not as bad as I did now.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
They said I was born with
it, so it's just something

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
you have to play around.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I had breast cancer.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.679 align:middle line:84%
And my big concern
was that I wanted

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that I was going
to be able to play in the State

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
finals in the fall
of '98 to qualify

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:90%
to go to Orlando in '99.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, when
the State finals came,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I was due for my chemo
on Monday of this week.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And the games were Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:90%
for the State games.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to go and play,
because that was as good

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.114 align:middle line:84%
as I was going to get, the day
before I had a chemo treatment.

00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't
have any hair,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:90%
so I wore this funky little hat.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:90%
But I went out and I played.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Then by the time we went
down to play in Orlando,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:90%
I was good by then.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the year we won the gold,
so I was real happy about that.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I had polio when I was about
six years old and had a little

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
residual weakness
in my right leg,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:84%
but nothing to interfere
with me physically much.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:90%
In 2001, I broke my ankle.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Then this insidious weakness
came that in the beginning

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't
notice it too much.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But now I began to notice
I couldn't do things.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
When you have polio,
you know, they

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
talk about the neurons and all
this really technical stuff.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have some
kind of accident or trauma

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to your body, it just sets
it off for some reason.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:90%
But I just--

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't have balance.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Going up and down steps and
stuff became hard for me.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Jo is the player at
this point in time

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
who's really crying, you
know, unseen tears because she

can't play.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I bet there wasn't
a day in the week

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that she would look forward to
any more than going to practice

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:90%
basketball.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I miss the
camaraderie of the people more

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
than I miss the
sports in one way.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I love to be around the team.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:90%
They're my friends.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I love to be there,
like to see them.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And so what else have I got
to do on Thursday morning?

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.641 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.641 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>> She's not fortunate to have
had good health all her life.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Of course, we all--

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.489 align:middle line:90%
we won't, more than likely.

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But I'm-- I really
feel sorry for her.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I can't say enough about it.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just been
a highlight of my life

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
actually to do all
this stuff, so--

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're my
best friends now.

00:09:34.063 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
As long as I've been
playing with them

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
we haven't had any
disagreements among ourselves.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty good, to
have that many women together.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> We can see ourselves
and each other.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:90%
They have their aches and pains.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.616 align:middle line:90%
They dig through it.

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
We've got one lady
at the church,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
she just thinks we
absolutely lost our minds.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Y'all need to quit that stuff.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Mary says, I'm not going to
quit until I have to quit.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.024 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that
keeps them going.

00:10:10.024 --> 00:10:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's different, but
we all have the same goals

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:90%
and everything in mind.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is
supportive of everybody.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
When something happens to one,
it sort of happens to us all.
