it's so obvious that
often what happens

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
is it's the tiny

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
you can see so clearly

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> For whatever
reason in our society,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
the safer the
childbirth becomes,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
there is almost hand in hand
an exaggerated fear of things

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:90%
going wrong.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody says
the same thing.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.565 align:middle line:90%
You had a home birth.

00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:90%
You're so brave.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think I can do it.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Never.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No I never went, no.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I personally
wouldn't risk my baby.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Not to detract from
the women's right,

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
there's a second person
involved in childbirth.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the baby has, I think,
the right to safety and care

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
but is not able to
voice those rights

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't have any part in
the decision making process.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think advocacy for the
yet or soon to be born child

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:90%
is very, very important.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>> There's this heightened
sensitivity about things going

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:90%
wrong.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And it colors the entire
way that, particularly,

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
some obstetricians and
midwives view their work.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So that it all
becomes an exercise

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
in avoiding complications
and risks and no attention

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.563 align:middle line:84%
to the positive
side of the work.

00:09:27.563 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I just wasn't frightened.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:90%
But there were people who were.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:84%
My mother was not,
because she was English.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was normal in England
when she was a young woman

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.390 align:middle line:90%
to have birth at home.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
So although lots
of things I did,

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
my mother didn't
approve of, having

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
a home birth was
something-- and she

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:90%
was a very frightened person.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But it was entirely
normal for her.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So that really pointed
out the difference

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
between England
and Australia to me

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:84%
because I expected her
to be, oh, don't do it.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:90%
But she was, oh, that's lovely.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole approach in the
NHS is that you choose between

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
a home birth, a birthing
center, or a hospital.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:90%
It's in the big book you get.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It's what midwives say,
wherever you want, your GP says.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And you go online.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.915 align:middle line:84%
And you can look up any
hospital on the NHS system.

00:10:13.915 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
They all have
their own websites.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And it will give you their rates
for how many women have home

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.560 align:middle line:84%
births and how many
transfer or not and Caesar

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:90%
rates and natural birth rates.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can look
and go, oh, wow,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
this hospital has a really,
really high Caesar rate.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people end
up having cesareans.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.337 align:middle line:90%
This one looks better.

00:10:33.337 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tried to find this
stuff out in Australia.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I was kind of
being asked for secret files.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And how dare I ask
things like that?

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're not statistics
that would be available to you.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The policy in the
UK is very progressive.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Women have a choice
about where they

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%
give birth, who'll look after
them, and the kind of birth

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:90%
that they want.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an unusual
maternity service,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
because we have about 5 and
1/2 thousand deliveries,

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
of which about
2,000, slightly less,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
take place either at home
or in midwife-led units,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:84%
which most people in the
developed world would think was

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:90%
either impossible or mad.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> With home births,
it's just the gentleness.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:90%
It's the whole ambience.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
You get the low lights.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
You can have the candles.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.443 align:middle line:84%
They can eat and
drink when they want.

00:11:23.443 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
They can go to their own toilet.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:90%
They're with their family.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That is a lot when
you're in labor.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can have
the children there

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
if you want to have the children
there, the family members.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:90%
It's like a ritual.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The ball is very firmly
in the woman's court.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:90%
It's her home.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:90%
It's her domain.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> She calls the shots.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have to always
remember that you're a guest

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:90%
in that home.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.208 align:middle line:84%
And so if she wants to
stop at 10 centimeters

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and start cooking beans on
toast, then you have to say,

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.337 align:middle line:84%
that's fine, as
long as I can listen

00:11:53.337 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:90%
in to the baby for five minutes.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.472 align:middle line:90%
You carry on.

00:11:55.472 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
You obviously feel you
need beans on toast.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I may even go
put the coffee on.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very much their game.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, there are things
you have to do for safety.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But apart from that, there's
just very little-- everything's

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:90%
very, very fluid.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would you not encourage
women to try and do the most

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
natural, beneficial thing
for them and their baby?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Why would you not
encourage them?

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre to me.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Why would you ignore
the statistics

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:84%
from all the countries
where it is a natural thing

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.860 align:middle line:90%
and it does happen?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Why would you say
that can't be right,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't apply to
Australian women or women

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:90%
living in this country?

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:90%
What are we so afraid of?

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had a very large
home birth study from

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
the Netherlands, over 500,000
women giving birth there,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%
low-risk women with midwives.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:84%
No difference in
perinatal mortality

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:90%
to giving birth in hospital.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
We've had the US study showing
over 5,000 births at home,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:90%
low-risk.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
No difference in
perinatal outcome,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
far better outcomes
for mom and baby.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But we've also had
some studies coming out

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:90%
where they've mixed the risk.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So we've had a study coming
out of the UK, which had

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:90%
twins and breaches included.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We've had a study coming out
from South Australia that again

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:90%
had high risk-women involved.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, when you remove the
high-risk women and only

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
looked at the low-risk,
no difference.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Add the high risk, yes,
there is increased risk.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
This isn't rocket science.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
If there are added
risks, then home

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.380 align:middle line:84%
is not often the best
place to be physically.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But some women may
feel mentally it is.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we come to the
third part of the debate.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.935 align:middle line:84%
Do women have the
right to make a choice?

00:13:35.935 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.233 align:middle line:84%
>> The definitive study where
you enroll a group of women

00:13:44.233 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
in home birth and a group
of women in hospital birth

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and look at it,
it won't be done.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:90%
There'll always be biases.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:90%
That study won't be done.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.755 align:middle line:84%
So they have to be
done retrospectively,

00:13:54.755 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
where you look back at births
and the data surrounding it

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and look at those figures.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And yes, each interest
group will obviously

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
be able to cite papers
and studies which support

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.998 align:middle line:90%
their particular argument.

00:14:10.998 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Having worked both in
the UK and in Australia,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
one of the challenges in
Australia is that looking after

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
healthy pregnancies is the bread
and butter for a large section

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.545 align:middle line:90%
of the obstetric workforce.

00:14:21.545 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult
to relinquish that.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.295 align:middle line:84%
It's not something you
can give up overnight.

00:14:25.295 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a massive
industrial change.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't exist in the
UK under the National Health

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Service, where
obstetricians actually want

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to look after
complex pregnancies

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and complicated
births only and are

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
very happy to leave the
normal healthy pregnancies

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.035 align:middle line:90%
to midwives or to GPs.

00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's healthy.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we were honest,
if we stood back from it,

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that's probably in the
interests of women.

it's in the system--

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:84%
is like having sex
in public because it

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:84%
is an intimate moment shared
with a perfect stranger.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Every single person,
even women that

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:84%
pay many thousands of dollars
to have a private obstetrician,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
will still share that
moment with someone

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:90%
they've never met before.

that continuity of carer,

outcomes.

00:15:29.635 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows this.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's hard
research to prove it.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But the system really doesn't
necessarily reflect that.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't make that a priority.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, it's not
just about continuity,

00:15:42.455 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
because you can't continuity
of care from a medical

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:90%
professional.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And they will take a
very medical attitude

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and still very much see you as
a belly, a baby, blood pressure,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Continuity care from a midwifery
perspective is a social model.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And that involves how are
you going as a person.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It involves listening
a lot, talking a lot.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:90%
It involves empowering women.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.615 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you can do this.

00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%

confirmation of the pregnancy

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and expressed my desire
to have a home birth

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and sought out my midwife,
Maggie Leckie Thompson.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And I saw her monthly and then
weekly in the last few weeks.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so loved and
embraced and empowered by her.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:90%
She filled me with confidence.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%
She was absolutely a realist.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:49.867 align:middle line:84%

her and watch how that supports

the midwife saying,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.237 align:middle line:84%
when the baby comes out,
nobody tell her what it is.

00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:32.445 align:middle line:90%

extraordinary feeling

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:90%
of my pelvis opening.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.088 align:middle line:84%
It was the most amazing
thing I've ever experienced.

00:17:44.088 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was sorry it didn't
happen the second time.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of popped
out the second time.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:84%

his head was out,

it was January in the
Blue Mountains, summer.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:84%
This amazing mist descended
all around the house.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And about 150,000
butterflies, white butterflies

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:90%
came to the windows.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
almighty clap of thunder.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:90%
And there were eight witnesses.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just me going nuts.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So loud that she was saying,
don't push, don't push,

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.925 align:middle line:84%
don't push because she
was checking the cord.

00:18:22.925 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't hear her.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, he came out.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And I just looked.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do anything.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.643 align:middle line:90%
I just looked at him.

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said, aren't you
going to pick him up?

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and I said, is it a boy?

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes,
it's a boy, damn it.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Sorry I told you.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I picked him up, put
him straight on the breast.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I was desperate for a
coffee for some reason.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the house, for three
days with both births,

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
the house felt like there
were angels around it.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere in the
house was just beautiful.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.188 align:middle line:84%

I study women's experiences

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
around the world and
how they're treated

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and how the medical system works

and how it affects their lives.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
The intervention that started
when doctors took over

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:90%
from midwives--

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:84%
and that really was
beginning way back

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:84%
in the last century for
women who were middle class

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and could afford to
pay for a doctor.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
has meant that birth

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
has been seen as
an ordeal rather

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:90%
than a challenge and a joy.

at stake here, new human life.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing more
important than new human life.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And so understandably,
lots of people

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
involved in maternity

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or doctors or anesthetists,
obstetricians,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
want to make it as
safe as possible.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And many people think
that to do that, you

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
need to be in hospital.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
And we don't agree actually.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:45.385 align:middle line:84%
I think what we want is
for women to have choice,

00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that they understand
that sometimes

would have been better

As a doctor, I guess I'm
used to assessing risk.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:13.100 align:middle line:84%

important decisions.

Especially working in
remote general practice,

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able to
balance risk very carefully.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess for me that
I was comfortable being

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:84%
able to look at all the risks
that were being presented to me

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.060 align:middle line:90%

But I found talking
to the obstetric team,

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
there was this expectation that
you didn't make any decisions

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:84%
yourself in your obstetric
care, that you took advice.

And that if you didn't take
that advice, your baby may die.

And at that time, I felt
absolutely shattered.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:90%
I really cried.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And I grieved for what I
knew I was going to lose,

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
my ability to, I guess, bring
my baby into the world naturally

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.055 align:middle line:84%
and do something that I knew
my body was capable of doing.

00:24:10.055 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Once you step into
the hospital system,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.763 align:middle line:90%
you take off your clothes.

00:24:12.763 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:90%
And you're given a gown.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
really felt like I'd

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
handed over my decision
making to the people who

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:90%
were looking after me.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I trusted them to, I guess,
make the right decisions for me

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and also to give me the
right information as well.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So when the obstetric
registrar said

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
that he'd seen some fetal
distress on the CTG monitor,

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.585 align:middle line:84%
I immediately agreed
to having a Cesarean.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, I actually found
out that the CTG was actually

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:84%
normal, and there wasn't
any fetal distress.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, that's
kind of colored my view

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.470 align:middle line:90%
of how obstetric care is given.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We have four decades of
evidence that show us that

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
being on the monitor does not
improve outcomes in any way.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
All it does is raise
the Cesarean rate.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Why does it do that?

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Because if you see
every deceleration,

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:90%
you start to freak out.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And then you go, oh, my god.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:90%
The baby's in distress.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And you rush off for a
Cesarean that wasn't necessary.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And you deliver by an
unnecessary Cesarean

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
a baby with an Apgar of 10,
because the baby was fine

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:90%
all along.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:84%

people take a supposedly

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:84%
troubling sign on any form
of evaluation and believe it

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
uncritically, because that's
where you end up with massive

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:90%
levels of intervention.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:84%

going to end up.

should be reducing the Cesarean

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%

was that women who

had paid through the nose

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:84%
were having more than double
the rates of intervention.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:84%
What was silent in that
research was the admission

the neonatal unit.

different dates.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.950 align:middle line:84%
At one of my ultrasounds
that was attended

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:84%
by another obstetrician,
she actually

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:84%
did mention at some point
maybe we could just give you

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:84%
a bit of Syntocinon,
which is a medication

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
to augment or bring on labor
as well, to get you going.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've got alarm
bells in my head

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:90%
saying, that's dangerous, no.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm never
going to have Syntocinon.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
increase my chances

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:90%
of having uterine rupture.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:84%
At that same time, we attended
a talk about vaginal birth

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:90%
after Cesarean.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.330 align:middle line:90%
And we learned about home birth.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And we realized
that, for us, that

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
was going to be
the only way I was

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
have a natural delivery.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
When I went into
labor, the midwives

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:90%
were there straight away.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I was able to use a birth
pool, which was amazing.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I did some relaxation in between
my contractions in the birth

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.670 align:middle line:84%
pool and was probably
the most relaxed

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I've ever been in
my life in that time

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and in such a good
space mentally

00:33:55.590 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to, I guess, make
it through a labor which did

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:90%
become a little bit difficult.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:84%
My cervix did the same thing as
it did with my first delivery.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:15.403 align:middle line:84%
And I had this little
anterior lip that got stuck.

00:34:15.403 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have an
epidural this time.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So I could feel the
baby moving down.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that my uterus was
doing the right thing by moving

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:90%
my baby down my pelvis.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
it there was room.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But this lip just
got in the way.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we did a lot of things
to try and get it moving.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:90%
I walked up lots of sets of.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:44.139 align:middle line:84%
Stairs and eventually
Helen was able to push

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that part of the cervix back.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to deliver
my baby naturally,

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:84%
which felt as though I'd
been waiting for four years

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:84%
to do since my first
experience with the Cesarean.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.180 align:middle line:84%
It felt really great and
very empowering, obviously.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:84%
My body was doing what
I knew it could do.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So that was a pretty
important moment for me.

can affect the interaction

and the baby.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:90%

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It's treated usually as if

dying in childbirth,

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
it's of the order of 10 in

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.085 align:middle line:84%
She's supposed to shut
up and get on with it

and let them do the birth.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:50.380 align:middle line:84%

that feeling helpless.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Consumers are constantly lied
to, are being dumbed down,

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.110 align:middle line:84%
treated in a very
paternalistic way,

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and essentially get
what the practitioner

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.458 align:middle line:90%
is comfortable with.

00:53:25.458 --> 00:53:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> All the mothers I've
talked to since I've been

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.690 align:middle line:84%
in Australia, the three
times that I've been here,

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:33.710 align:middle line:84%
complain bitterly that they
were so disillusioned when they

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.440 align:middle line:84%
found out that their private
OB gave them less choice than

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:39.630 align:middle line:84%
a midwife or a public OB
even would have given them.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:40.910 align:middle line:90%
It can be very disillusioning.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.577 align:middle line:84%
I think women in
Australia should really

00:53:42.577 --> 00:53:45.170 align:middle line:84%
understand, having a private
OB does not mean you get

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.760 align:middle line:90%
private, uniquely yours care.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It means you'll get treated in
an even more standardized way.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.725 align:middle line:84%
>> When you do get
pregnant, most women--

00:53:52.725 --> 00:53:53.975 align:middle line:90%
maybe that's a generalization.

00:53:53.975 --> 00:53:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think most women want
a whole lot of knowledge

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:57.830 align:middle line:90%
because it's unknown.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:53:59.540 align:middle line:84%
When you haven't
done it before, you

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.250 align:middle line:90%
want to know what it's like.

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:04.770 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
what it feels like.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I went and I did a course with
a woman called Lena Clerk.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:13.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was fantastic.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.950 align:middle line:84%
It was fantastic because
there were probably

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.000 align:middle line:90%
only about 10 mothers.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But that could equate to like
25, 30 people in this room.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And there were people
having home births.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I never heard a home birth.

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.050 align:middle line:84%
There were people
in birth centers.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.450 align:middle line:84%
There were people who were
having an obstetrician

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:30.250 align:middle line:90%
at a home birth.

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.450 align:middle line:84%
There were people who
just had midwife-led care.

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:33.908 align:middle line:84%
And there were
people in hospitals,

00:54:33.908 --> 00:54:36.680 align:middle line:84%
both public and private,
all doing these classes.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I learned then at
class that there were

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:42.160 align:middle line:90%
lots of ways to have a baby.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.747 align:middle line:84%
So then I went back to
my obstetrician armed

00:54:44.747 --> 00:54:45.830 align:middle line:90%
with all this information.

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:48.182 align:middle line:84%
And something happened for
the next two appointments.

00:54:48.182 --> 00:54:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't get
to talk about it.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And then anyway, at
36 weeks pregnant,

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I finally have my birth plan
meeting with my obstetrician.

00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And my husband's not
there for that visit.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my own.

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm excited.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited about giving birth.

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about
finally talking

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:12.830 align:middle line:84%
about what I want with the woman
who's going to deliver my baby.

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so in early labor
we'd like to labor at home.

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll come in at the
right time when we come in.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said I didn't
want any pain relief.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And she laughed at me.

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And she laughed at me in this
really condescending kind

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.740 align:middle line:84%
of, [SNEERING LAUGHTER]
yeah, right kind of way.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to get alarm
bells going off a little bit.

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Women are getting strong
messages about that they

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.190 align:middle line:84%
don't really have to do
their labors anymore.

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:50.120 align:middle line:84%
They could find people who would
rather do elective Caesars.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Or they certainly don't have
to feel their labor anymore.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't value that
process of women

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:00.390 align:middle line:84%
working with their bodies,
to birth their babies.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So the labor bypass era,
it's across the board

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.870 align:middle line:84%
in the acculturation and
the messages that women get.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Women who are still what I
would call willing women who

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:12.410 align:middle line:84%
want to have a go, they,
whether they really

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.900 align:middle line:84%
understand it or not, are
actually counter-culture women

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.770 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you've got
people saying to you,

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.460 align:middle line:90%
here are your options for birth.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.330 align:middle line:90%
You can have an epidural.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:21.240 align:middle line:90%
You can have a general.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:21.980 align:middle line:90%
You can have a Caesar.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.710 align:middle line:90%
You can have a this.

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:23.300 align:middle line:90%
You can have a that.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.133 align:middle line:90%
You can have a that.

00:56:24.133 --> 00:56:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But no, you can't just go
home and give birth naturally.

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going
to feel inadequate.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I can't take the pain.

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Of course you can.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:33.797 align:middle line:90%
Of course you can take the pain.

00:56:33.797 --> 00:56:35.630 align:middle line:84%
If you can handle it
when your leg's broken,

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:37.088 align:middle line:84%
or if you can handle
it when you've

00:56:37.088 --> 00:56:38.925 align:middle line:84%
got a terrible
toothache, can't you

00:56:38.925 --> 00:56:40.550 align:middle line:84%
handle it when you've
got a pain that's

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:44.070 align:middle line:84%
going, whoa, going, whoa, going,
terrible, terrible, terrible,

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:46.800 align:middle line:90%
baby?

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a reward.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:50.523 align:middle line:90%
There's a reward.

00:56:50.523 --> 00:56:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I'd learned all
these great things about

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:53.490 align:middle line:90%
positions.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And it made so much
sense to me for someone

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.880 align:middle line:84%
who's trained as a dancer and
knows their body very well

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and what their body can do,
about squatting and opening up

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.720 align:middle line:84%
your pelvis to let
gravity help the baby.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, all my ladies
give birth on their back.

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking you
don't want to get

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.700 align:middle line:84%
your Armani trousers dirty by
squatting on the floor with me.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was thinking
of her at that point.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I had done a lot
of reading about third stage

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and about the blood transfer
that happens from the placenta

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:33.530 align:middle line:84%
to the baby and
also the hormones,

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:35.450 align:middle line:84%
like taking away the
baby's adrenaline

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and giving it the
oxytocin and it

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:39.860 align:middle line:84%
getting the same happy
hormones as the mother.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And to me and to Matthew,
that seemed really important.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We are in an
absolutely new situation.

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:53.210 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
the history of mankind,

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:56.630 align:middle line:84%
the number of women who
give birth to the baby

00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and to the placenta,
thanks to release

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:04.280 align:middle line:84%
of a cocktail of love
hormones, this number

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.040 align:middle line:90%
is approaching zero.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Oxytocin that keeps labor
going well and is the hormone

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:16.910 align:middle line:84%
of love and curiosity
and calmness and caring

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and the endorphins that
our bodies also produce is

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:23.750 align:middle line:90%
an opiate.

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:25.200 align:middle line:90%
It's the very best one.

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the one with no unpleasant
or dangerous side effects.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When a woman has a drip
of synthetic oxytocin,

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.460 align:middle line:84%
often associated with other
drugs like epidural anaesthesia

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and so on, it means that this
synthetic oxytocin blocks

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the release of the natural
hormones without having

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:55.160 align:middle line:90%
the same behavioral effect.

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So let our bodies, just a
wonderful chemical producer

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:03.200 align:middle line:84%
of stuff that doesn't give
any pharmaceutical company

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.100 align:middle line:90%
profits--

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.170 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But let us have that knowledge
that our bodies are sacred.

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So I did not want
to cut the cord.

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted a natural
third stage delivery.

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And she just said to me--

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I get so angry
thinking about it.

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:22.983 align:middle line:90%
She said to me, oh, no.

00:59:22.983 --> 00:59:24.900 align:middle line:84%
We have to get that
placenta out straightaway.

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I always cut the cord and
then take the thing out,

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:29.120 align:middle line:84%
because my job's not done till
I can inspect the placenta.

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Her job's not done till she
can inspect the placenta.

00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So she can't wait around
40 minutes for me?

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.960 align:middle line:90%


00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:42.330 align:middle line:90%
So it made me very upset.

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> How often have we all
seen obstetricians sort

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.180 align:middle line:84%
of fidgeting, wanting this
baby out, that sort of thing?

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That's not really quite
what it's all about.

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Midwives, on the other hand,
are there for the duration.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.500 align:middle line:90%
They have nothing else to do.

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.570 align:middle line:84%
That is their focus, boing, you
are going to have your baby.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be with
you until you've delivered.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And if it's in 10
minutes, whoopee.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.080 align:middle line:84%
If it's in three hours
and 47 minutes, so be it.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
sort of attendant,

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.190 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me,
that somebody needs

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
in childbirth, and
absolutely not somebody who's

01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:23.270 align:middle line:90%
got other things to do.

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may be that
out there, there

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.830 align:middle line:84%
is a massive cohort
of obstetricians

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%
who are prepared to
take exactly that view.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say,
haven't met them yet.

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I just said, I don't
think this is going to work.

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I think I have to go.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I'll
give her credit for

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:43.818 align:middle line:84%
is she recognized it wasn't
going to work as well.

01:00:43.818 --> 01:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't try
to talk me around.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
She just went, yeah, I don't
think is going to work.

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.983 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, she didn't
recommend anybody else.

01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So I walked out of there
at 36 weeks pregnant.

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I had nowhere to have my baby.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The important thing is
that a woman births her baby

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
in an environment
that is good for her.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.760 align:middle line:90%
So she needs to feel supported.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
She needs to feel safe, warm,
protected, comfortable, free

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.520 align:middle line:90%
to move around.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.270 align:middle line:84%
She needs to feel at one
with the environment.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, for some women, the
very idea of home birth

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:20.640 align:middle line:90%
would set them into a panic.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.188 align:middle line:84%
They associate
hospital with being

01:01:22.188 --> 01:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in a very safe place
where everything

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:25.890 align:middle line:90%
is there to sort things out.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine
because that probably

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.880 align:middle line:84%
will be the best
environment for them.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But as we know, a lot of
people don't like hospitals.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.430 align:middle line:90%
They associate it with illness.

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And they don't like
the smell even.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't like
anything about it.

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
sense that's not

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
going to be a great place
for them to labor and birth.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, having a room full
of medical professionals

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.420 align:middle line:84%
at my birth, I see
that as empowering.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I see myself as being lucky
and fortunate to have that.

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it as
a bad thing at all.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I see it
is a great thing.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, the thought
of actually having a baby

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
in hospital makes me
feel physically ill.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.757 align:middle line:84%
Even visiting friends
of mine in hospital

01:02:05.757 --> 01:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
after they've had their babies,
just the rules and the routine

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and everything, even that
will set my teeth on edge.

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Whereas being at home, you're
just free to be who you are.

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Walking into the Hawthorne
birth center and meeting

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Barbara the midwife and Bruce,
it was just like I didn't have

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.420 align:middle line:90%
to worry about that anymore.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So I could just be in the space
I needed to be to have Olivia.

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:34.430 align:middle line:90%


01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I went into labor
in the late evening.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I'd gone to bed.

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.542 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up with labor pains.

01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And my sister had
stayed the night.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And Matt was there.

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And we rang the midwife.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'll go to the
birth center and put Paul on.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.160 align:middle line:90%
And she did that.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I actually got in
the bath at home,

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
because water was
very important to me.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.744 align:middle line:90%
I knew I wanted water around me.

01:02:59.744 --> 01:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I labored at home
not for very long.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'd gone into established
labor quite quickly.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:05.900 align:middle line:90%
We got in the car.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.970 align:middle line:90%
That was the worst bit.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.637 align:middle line:84%
It's really shitty
getting in a car when

01:03:08.637 --> 01:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
you're in labor because
you go out of your home

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.750 align:middle line:90%
into traffic and noise and dark.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.265 align:middle line:90%
And you can't get comfortable.

01:03:16.265 --> 01:03:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And that was yucky.

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:19.255 align:middle line:84%
So then when I got
to the birth center,

01:03:19.255 --> 01:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to get in
the water straight away.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I labored in the water.

01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And when this involuntary
muscle contraction happened,

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.410 align:middle line:90%
something went off in my hand.

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:34.165 align:middle line:90%
And I went, aha, OK, I get it.

01:03:34.165 --> 01:03:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Then I went into second stage.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I got the pushing
urge, I was like, oh, right,

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.030 align:middle line:90%
that bearing down.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.122 align:middle line:84%
And so the only way
that I can describe--

01:03:44.122 --> 01:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't a medical
description, you understand.

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a Kate
Gorman description.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Is your uterus is doing this
and pushing down and pushing in.

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can use
your stomach muscles

01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to do that as well
in the same time.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And once I got that it
was like I had something.

01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I knew what to do.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, I'm fine.

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.750 align:middle line:90%
I remember feeling the head.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:09.100 align:middle line:90%
And it actually was coming out.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And just, oh, my god.

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:11.980 align:middle line:90%
My baby's coming.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so excited.

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It was just beautiful.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And I was doing it.

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Then when Olivia was born in
the water, Matt caught her.

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
He was sitting behind me.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And he passed her
up through my legs.

01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And I brought her up
through the water.

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara gave
me a face washer.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Kate,
just wipe her face.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.490 align:middle line:90%
I wiped her face.

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I went, [BLOWS SOFTLY].

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:45.129 align:middle line:90%
And she went, [GASPS HAPPILY].

01:04:45.129 --> 01:04:46.560 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.430 align:middle line:90%


01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
giving life again.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I'd just given birth.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.896 align:middle line:90%
And then I made her breathe.

01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:01.356 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:06.753 align:middle line:90%


01:05:06.753 --> 01:05:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is something about
the template about birthing

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:11.503 align:middle line:84%
and taking it on and going
through that rite of passage,

01:05:11.503 --> 01:05:15.125 align:middle line:84%
having the support around that
helps you to move through that

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
that sets a pattern in the
mother at least and I think

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
for the partners to feel
like with the right support,

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:24.947 align:middle line:90%
I can take on anything.

01:05:24.947 --> 01:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And with the right support, my
own strength will come forward.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is a fabulous place
to be starting our parenting

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.280 align:middle line:90%
journey from.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:38.615 align:middle line:90%


01:05:38.615 --> 01:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In my second pregnancy,
circumstances had us living

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.620 align:middle line:90%
in England.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.420 align:middle line:90%
We were on a farm.

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
But there was a small
village near us.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And it had a clinic,
a doctors' clinic.

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And attached to that was
a midwifery department.

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I was walking into NHS
expecting a bit of a fight.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what I wanted
was a water birth at home.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.960 align:middle line:90%
They didn't blink an eyelid.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
In my little tiny area,
they do one a month.

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt so good to be
in a maternity system where

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.740 align:middle line:90%
my choices were supported.

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was surrounded
by midwives who

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:20.490 align:middle line:90%
knew that home birth was safe.

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I just find it so
frustrating that Australia

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%
doesn't think like that.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.940 align:middle line:90%


01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting for me to
travel to so many countries

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
of the world and to see how
many countries are imitating US

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:40.313 align:middle line:84%
maternity care policy
when it's not a good idea.

01:06:40.313 --> 01:06:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And you can like blue jeans.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.320 align:middle line:90%
You can like jazz.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
But don't like our
maternity care policies,

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
leading you in a good way.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The maternity care system
in New Zealand, in my opinion,

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.060 align:middle line:90%
is the best in the world.

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I used to think the
Netherlands was the best.

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And now I would
rate it number two.

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But New Zealand I
would rate number one.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Because first of all,
100% of New Zealand births

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.910 align:middle line:90%
are attended by midwives.

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, a mother
has her full choice

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:10.160 align:middle line:90%
to pick a lead maternity carer.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
They call it LMC.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And that can be a midwife.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.810 align:middle line:90%
It can be an obstetrician.

01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Or it can be a GP.

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:20.935 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the midwives
set this up in the 1990s,

01:07:20.935 --> 01:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
obstetricians went
along with it,

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
because they thought the lead
maternity carer would be them.

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Ironically enough, 80%
of New Zealand women

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:31.340 align:middle line:84%
pick a midwife to be their
lead maternity carer.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, New Zealand
midwives are all

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
about normal
physiological birth.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the model that
they're taught.

01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:38.792 align:middle line:84%
And all their skills
in school, what

01:07:38.792 --> 01:07:40.250 align:middle line:84%
they learn in
midwifery training is

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
how to facilitate normal
physiological birth.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at the reforms
around birth in New Zealand--

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and we were all in much the
same position 20 years ago.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:56.360 align:middle line:84%
0.3% of women gave birth
at home at that time.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And we're still there.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But in New Zealand, they
had a visionary woman

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
who was the health
minister who later

01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:05.130 align:middle line:90%
became the prime minister.

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Her whole cabinet, every
woman in that parliament

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
crossed the floor
to vote that women

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:17.420 align:middle line:84%
should have the choice of where
to give birth and with whom.

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was as simple as that.

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> If a woman goes to a
midwife in British Columbia,

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.660 align:middle line:90%
she is cared for by the midwife.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
But the midwife
bills the government.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.859 align:middle line:84%
So the provincial medical
health care system actually

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:38.060 align:middle line:84%
compensates, pays the midwife
for the care that she provides.

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:42.439 align:middle line:84%
So having a home birth as
part of the health care system

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
is actually a safety factor
as well as a social factor.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I think women who choose
to have a home birth deserve

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.069 align:middle line:84%
government support, just
as I received some sort

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of taxpayer-funded support to
have the choice that I had,

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
which was to go to a private
hospital and have a Cesarean.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.439 align:middle line:90%
I think it's just as important.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just as valid.

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't it be
radical if the government

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.840 align:middle line:84%
supported all women to have
the births that they choose?

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And why aren't we
lobbying for that?

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.315 align:middle line:90%

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:33.529 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Croatian.

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a mother.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a wife.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.359 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a milliner.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:42.109 align:middle line:90%
And I'm blessed.

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I have good friends.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I have a strong family.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I have a beautiful son
and a beautiful husband.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And most of all, I would
describe myself as lucky.

01:10:01.195 --> 01:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't thought about
it in any great detail

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:04.593 align:middle line:90%
before I got pregnant.

01:10:04.593 --> 01:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But I just knew
that I didn't want

01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
to give birth in a hospital.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem
like the right kind

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of caring, loving,
supportive environment

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that I just assumed
you would want

01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.450 align:middle line:90%
when you were birthing a baby.

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Being at a hospital
was just strange.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It was like, don't sit
there, you can't sit there

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:27.025 align:middle line:90%
kind of thing.

01:10:27.025 --> 01:10:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It was like, you can't sit
on the bed with your partner

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:30.810 align:middle line:90%
kind of thing.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like that every
time I was at the hospital.

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:37.482 align:middle line:84%
But this being at home, I
could do whatever I want.

01:10:37.482 --> 01:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And my partner could
do whatever she wanted.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And if she wanted to chuck
stuff around the floor, she can.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.847 align:middle line:90%
>> But I didn't.

01:10:45.847 --> 01:10:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Home birth was the first
place the partners were

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
in the room, where
women got off the bed,

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:54.535 align:middle line:84%
where alternative methods
of pain relief were used,

01:10:54.535 --> 01:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
where different birthing
positions were used.

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So home birth is the reason
that anything good is happening

01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:01.920 align:middle line:90%
in our maternity service today.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> My pregnancy was interesting,
in that I have never felt

01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
so well or so strong or so
capable or so frightened

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:16.480 align:middle line:90%
by what people were telling me.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.570 align:middle line:90%
So we would see Jan.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would come out feeling
strong and capable and

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:22.510 align:middle line:90%
independent.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And I can do this.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a
positive experience.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have everyone
who cares around me.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And then I would see my GP.

01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:34.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'd come out scared.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I think I was about seven
weeks from Nate's birth.

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And he hadn't turned around yet.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.150 align:middle line:90%
So I saw a woman obstetrician.

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And as a woman, I've always
gravitated towards female GPs,

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:54.500 align:middle line:84%
thought I would be in
more empathetic hands

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.390 align:middle line:90%
with a female obstetrician.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:12:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, this
woman was a complete fuckwit.

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
She told me that seven weeks
out, there was no chance

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.650 align:middle line:90%
that Nate would turn.

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
She told me that unless I
booked myself in for a Cesarean

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.870 align:middle line:90%
that Nate and or I would die.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her I couldn't
believe what she'd said to me.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, are
you seriously telling

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%
me that my baby will die?

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, babies
don't turn this late.

01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I'll try everything.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.753 align:middle line:90%
I'll try acupuncture.

01:12:29.753 --> 01:12:30.920 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of acupuncture.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.480 align:middle line:90%
It works very well for me.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that
believing in acupuncture

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
was about as medically
relevant as believing in god.

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
This woman knew
nothing about me.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I could have been
a devout Christian.

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.070 align:middle line:90%
I could have been a devout Jew.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I could have had some
harebrained ideas

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.010 align:middle line:90%
about goddesses.

01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:51.440 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't matter.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.030 align:middle line:84%
What she was
basically saying to me

01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:56.000 align:middle line:90%
was everything I felt was wrong.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And unless I do it her way,
my baby was going to die.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We often blame women.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.407 align:middle line:84%
And we say women
are more fearful.

01:13:03.407 --> 01:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's actually time
to look at the health providers

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and how we're generating fear.

01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And the language we use
with women, the environments

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that we provide care in can
all generate enormous fear.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I went back to my GP for
something completely unrelated.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And she asked how my
pregnancy was going.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.438 align:middle line:84%
I told her what had
happened at the hospital.

01:13:27.438 --> 01:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And this woman looked
me in the eye--

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.450 align:middle line:90%
this was a woman I trusted.

01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
She'd been my GP
for a few years.

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd found her really open
and honest and caring.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And she looked me in
the eye and she told me

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that an elective Cesarean
was a perfectly pleasant way

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.780 align:middle line:90%
to bring a baby into the world.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.945 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
I was going mad.

01:13:49.945 --> 01:13:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't believe
that I was surrounded

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:56.800 align:middle line:84%
by so many women who were so
determined that slicing open

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
my abdomen and
pulling my baby out

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.330 align:middle line:90%
was the best thing for me to do.

01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Women who choose home
birth often have a different

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.605 align:middle line:84%
philosophical framework to
women who choose hospital birth.

01:14:08.605 --> 01:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've just finished
a study looking

01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:12.990 align:middle line:84%
at the choices around vaginal
birth after Cesarean section.

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And what became
really clear is women

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
who chose to have vaginal
birth after Cesarean

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
came from what we called
a mother birth framework.

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Their philosophy was
what's good for me

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and makes me healthy and
happy is good for my baby

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.560 align:middle line:90%
because I will mother better.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The women who chose
repeat Cesarean often

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
came from a childbirth
framework, which

01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
was my job as a good mother
is to sacrifice myself

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:37.500 align:middle line:90%
for my baby.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Society very much
sits on the side

01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of the childbirth
framework and says,

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
good mothers
sacrifice themselves.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Women who say, strong
mothers, empowered mothers,

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
powerful mothers and healthy
mothers are good mothers

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
often shout into this world
that does not understand them.

01:14:54.370 --> 01:15:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What it made me realize is
that the choices that I've made

01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
about what was good for me and
the baby I was carrying were

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:22.430 align:middle line:84%
right, that my instincts were
right, that my midwife was,

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
along with Nick, the best people
to be with me during my labor.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:33.660 align:middle line:90%


01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We had an appointment with Jan
and had called her that day

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.012 align:middle line:90%
in floods of tears.

01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
She talked me down, told me
everything would be fine,

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
to come tomorrow, and
we'd talk about it.

01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:44.820 align:middle line:90%
She checked him.

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
She checked me.

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
She said that we were fine
and to just give it a few more

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.150 align:middle line:90%
weeks and see how he went.

01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And he turned.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> In every country I visit,
when women actively choose home

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.590 align:middle line:84%
birth in a developed country,
it is because they are informed

01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:06.940 align:middle line:90%
and educated.

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And they understand that
home birth will give them

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
the best chance of a safe,
normal, physiological birth,

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
home birth with a
skilled assistant,

01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
home birth, especially planned
home birth with a midwife.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What the research says
is for normal physiological

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
childbirth, women are
best supported by known,

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
experienced
caregivers, one-on-one,

01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
continuously
throughout the labor.

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:33.857 align:middle line:84%
You might think that if we
were interested as a culture

01:16:33.857 --> 01:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
about normal
physiological childbirth,

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
we might provide
for women in labor.

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, in
our birth culture,

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
you really have
got to search out

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
anything that
approximates getting

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:47.950 align:middle line:90%
that in your care situation.

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:50.052 align:middle line:84%
And most women, if
they're on the game

01:16:50.052 --> 01:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and understand about this, if
they really understand what's

01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
required, they're more
or less have to design

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.900 align:middle line:84%
this for themselves
because it's not

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
on offer apart from in very
small pockets in our birth

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.230 align:middle line:90%
culture.

01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> So we got to 42 weeks.

01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:05.120 align:middle line:84%
We were seeing Jan
a lot at that point.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And it hadn't quite
engaged fully.

01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And he showed no signs
at all of coming.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We found out that my fluid
levels were really quite low.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.330 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want him
to go into distress.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So we went back that afternoon
and had my waters broken.

01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And I went into labor.

01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, OK, I might be
in hospital, but Jan's with me.

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It's all fine.

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And then I got to 5 centimeters.

01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And they rolled over
and went to sleep.

01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:41.530 align:middle line:90%
And I stopped contracting.

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
A very sympathetic, very
young woman said to me,

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
give you a Cesarean.

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I stalled and
stalled and stalled.

01:17:50.710 --> 01:17:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Eventually spoke to Jan.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I think this is
probably what we need to do.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So then I talked to them about,
if this is what we have to do,

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:05.940 align:middle line:90%
I want to be awake.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.230 align:middle line:90%
I want Nick to be with me.

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I want Jan to be with me.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anyone to tell
me what sex my baby is.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
to cut the cord,

01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:17.273 align:middle line:90%
if you can possibly help it.

01:18:17.273 --> 01:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
If you do have to cut the cord,
I want you to cut it long.

01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them, I'd
like it to be really quiet.

01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want Nate arriving in--

I wanted Nate to come surrounded
by his family in his home,

in his living room.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't want
was him to be wrenched out

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:19.065 align:middle line:84%
of me in an operating
theater with noise and light

01:19:19.065 --> 01:19:19.865 align:middle line:90%

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, they were
very gentle and quiet.

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a picture I have
of him being lifted out.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:36.810 align:middle line:90%

that if we associate
