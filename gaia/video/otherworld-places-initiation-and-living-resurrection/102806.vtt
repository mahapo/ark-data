what is the truth

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%

that the name Tuthmosis

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
who guard the gate
into the other world.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It was said that Djehuti
knew the secrets of the night

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and could initiate them
to the living by the use

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of correct techniques
so they might visit

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:90%
the Otherworld and return.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
His teachings
describe how this can

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:90%
be achieved while still alive.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:10%
"The human being can
become established on high

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:10%
without ever leaving the earth."

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
There are many identical
cases of burial chambers

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
with absent burials
throughout Egypt.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the best
known is this one.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:84%
According to
orthodox archaeology,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid is a
tomb of Pharaoh Khufu.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet in 500 BC, even the
Greek historian Herodotus

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
stated how this
pharaoh built himself

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
a subterranean burial
chamber on the hill of Giza

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:90%
where the pyramids stand.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, Khufu was not
buried in this building,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
nor is there evidence it
was ever used as a tomb.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But people who've
spend time reflecting

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
inside its main chamber,
including scientists,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
recall seeing unusually
tall people dressed

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of silk emerging
from the walls like figures

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Those who've meditated inside
the granite box describe

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
travelling to other realities
as though in a shamanic journey.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.945 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the Great
Pyramid's real name offers

00:10:27.945 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:90%
a clue behind its real purpose.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
it was referred

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to as the House of Osiris
after the Egyptian god

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:90%
of resurrection.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:84%
In the myth, Osiris is placed
inside a box and dismembered,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
his body carried down the
river, then reassembled

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:84%
by his consort Isis, the
divine virgin, whereupon Osiris

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:90%
resurrects as a new being.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
He has effectively
risen from the dead.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:10%
Like so many myths, it is a
vessel for a spiritual truth.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:10%
In this case, it
perfectly describes

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:10%
the journey of the initiate who
crosses into the Otherworld.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
In this voluntary
near death experience,

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
the candidate's
preconceived notions of life

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
must first be
shattered if they are

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
to successfully cross a kind
of river into the afterlife.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
It is there that
the soul comes face

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to face with the creative
forces of the universe.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:84%
In the language of
the temple, this

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
was referred to as
a sacred marriage

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.835 align:middle line:90%
with the divine virgin.

00:11:32.835 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Once the individual is made
aware of the great mystery

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of life, he or she
is reassembled,

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
in a matter of speaking, and the
soul returns to the living body

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:90%
more awake than ever before.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Such initiations were
conducted in secret chambers

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:90%
inside the temples.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Successful candidates were
declared risen from the dead

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
because this eye-opening
journey had made them feel

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
as though, for the first time,
they really were alive compared

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.965 align:middle line:84%
to ordinary people who went
about life as though asleep

00:12:07.965 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and unaware of the
true nature of things.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:90%
They were called the dead.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:90%
[STATIC]

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.470 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting that
the interior passages

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid so resemble
the diagrams of the Otherworld.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
The journey begins in a
subterranean room made

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
of rough stone, continues
along an ascending passage,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and concludes in the
initiation chamber

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:84%
where the stone is
polished, a perfect metaphor

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:84%
of the initiate who
progresses from a rough form

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to a polished diamond.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
These are just a few
examples that not all temples

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:84%
were built for
funerary purposes,

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
but instead served
a ritual function.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.820 align:middle line:84%
As the Egyptians
themselves declared,

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
a tomb may be a place of
rest, but not necessarily

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:90%
a person's final resting place.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
In the temple of Abydos, there's
a chapel dedicated exclusively

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to Osiris, the god-man
who returns transformed

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:90%
from the Otherworld.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
He is the example for
other immortals to follow.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Beneath lies one of the most
formidable underground chambers

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
ever built, the Osireion,
made from cyclopean

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:90%
blocks of red granite.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Judging from the buildup of
mud around its perimeter,

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
it is believed to be at
least 12,000 years old.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:90%
The name speaks for itself.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It is a House of Osiris, leaving
little doubt that the mystery

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:84%
play of his rebirth was taught
and performed here in what was

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:90%
essentially an artificial cave.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, the
only surviving source

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:84%
of information on the rites
and the mysteries conducted

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
at sites such as this came
from the second century writer

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.555 align:middle line:84%
Lucius Apuleius based on his
personal initiation experience.

00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Lucius describes how
he underwent a period

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:84%
of observation within the
temple where the priests taught

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:84%
him asceticism and how
to purge base emotions

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
from the physical body, followed
by a 10-day fast in preparation

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:90%
for the final stage.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Then at sunset on the
final day, Apuleius

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:84%
writes, "The high priest
ordered all uninitiated persons

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to depart, invested in
me a new linen garment,

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and led me by the hand into the
inner recesses of the sanctuary

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I approached the
very gates of death

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and set one foot on
Persephone's threshold.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I journeyed through
all the elements

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:90%
and yet was permitted to return.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:84%
At midnight, I saw the sun
shining as if it were noon.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I entered the presence of
the gods of the Otherworld,

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:18.610 align:middle line:90%
stood near, and worshiped them."

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Apuleius describes the benefit
of his experiences being,

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
"In a certain sense,
reborn and brought back

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:90%
on the road of a new blessing."

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian texts add that the
priest or initiate would

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
go into a restricted
room and enter

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
a state of meditation
which paved the way

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:90%
for access into the Otherworld.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
The priests expected
every person

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to return, albeit sometimes
stunned by what they'd seen.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Yet again at Abydos,
there is no burial.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh associated
with this temple, Seti I,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
was buried precisely
52 miles away

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:90%
in the Valley of the Kings.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But virtually
equidistant to Abydos

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
lies another chapel dedicated
to Osiris, this time at Edfu.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's as though the planners were
using a numerological reference

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to places of the Otherworld
because 52 also happens

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
to be the angle of the
slope of that other House

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:90%
of Osiris, the Great Pyramid.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:10%
It is also the angle
of the heptagon

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:10%
which esoteric
teachings describe

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:10%
as the geometry of the soul.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:38.355 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.355 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Edfu is dedicated to the
falcon god Horus, the image

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:90%
of the resurrected Osiris.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
In this temple, restricted
knowledge concerning initiation

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
called "raising" was transmitted
in secret to a select few.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:84%
This essential instruction,
allowing access

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
to the Otherworld, was conducted
in two underground chambers

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
accessed through passages hidden
within Edfu's hollow walls.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.868 align:middle line:84%
The same ritual was reenacted
500 years later in Jerusalem

00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:90%
by Jesus and the Essenes.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.540 align:middle line:84%
What initiates saw and
learned in the Otherworld

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:90%
was not to be shared.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And in case they forgot, an
injunction carved on the temple

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:90%
wall was there to remind them.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It reads, "Do not reveal what
you have seen in the mysteries

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:90%
of the temple."

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
An identical chamber exists
in the temple of Dendera.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Accessed through a
hole in the floor,

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.520 align:middle line:84%
the claustrophobic
passageway leads

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.910 align:middle line:84%
to narrow chambers officially
described as storage rooms.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So why the walls
should be covered

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
with these elaborate
ritual scenes

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:90%
is illogical, to say the least.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But the rooms are ideal for a
person undergoing incubation

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:84%
while the murals depict one
of a kind reliefs and symbols

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:84%
of what can only be
described as instructions

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:90%
of a regeneration ritual.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
One place that is synonymous
with transformation

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is Saqqara, a sprawling
ceremonial temple

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:84%
complex named for Seker,
the falcon god of rebirth.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
The name comes from "sekre"
meaning, "hurry to me,"

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
the cry made by Isis to
guide the soul of Osiris

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:84%
as it travels through the
darkness towards the Otherworld

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to unite with his
celestial bride.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
In Saqqara, one finds
the earliest surviving

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
sacred literature offering a
unique window into the ritual

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.331 align:middle line:84%
connecting a living person with
the Otherworld, the Pyramid

00:18:40.331 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Texts.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Covering the walls of
the hidden chambers

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
beneath the pyramid
of the Pharaoh Unas,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the four and a half
thousand year old

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid Texts contain the
most detailed instructions

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Otherworld, how to
get there, how to overcome

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
negative forces at the start,
and the correct use of spells

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and incantations essential
for the soul to maintain

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:90%
focus throughout the journey.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:10%
They also imply
they were intended

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:10%
as a ritual where the
initiate was expected

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:10%
to return to the living body.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:10%
Once again, this necropolis
contains no evidence of Unas'

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:10%
burial, just an
empty black granite

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:10%
sarcophagus lying purposefully
in the west section

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:10%
of the complex, the symbolic
direction of the Otherworld.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramid Texts represent a
series of mystical experiences

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
akin to those
described in shamanism,

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
but the unusual theme that
defines the Pyramid Texts

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
as an instruction meant for
a living person undergoing

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
a figurative rather
than literal death

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:90%
is found beside the sarcophagus.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
"O, Unas, you have
not departed dead.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:84%
You have departed alive to
sit upon the throne of Osiris

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
so that you may give
orders to the living."

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:90%
The message is clear.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh has ascended into
the Otherworld very much alive.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And by following in the
footsteps of Osiris,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
he is able to communicate with
the living and the discarnate

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:90%
alike.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:84%
A second clue that
the texts were

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
used as a tool for the
living is a description

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:84%
of Unas undergoing a spiritual
purification to the repeated

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:90%
chorus of, "Unas is not dead.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Unas is not dead," preceded
by the rebirth of his spirit

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:90%
back into his living body.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
No other utterance so
encapsulates the central theme

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
common to all
mysteries traditions,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that the soul is capable
of temporarily disengaging

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
from the living body, journeying
independently into the spirit

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:90%
world, and returning.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The point of the
Pyramid Texts was

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:84%
to expose the soul of
the living to the wonders

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Otherworld and return
it to the body with knowledge

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
of celestial
mechanics so that they

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:90%
might be applied in daily life.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
This is how the divine flows
through the conscious self

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:84%
while a person performs
the earthly duties.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It forms a central tenet
of esoteric thought.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But above all, it's
an experience designed

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
for the living, not to
be left undiscovered

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.926 align:middle line:84%
until the moment one exhales
their last breath on Earth.

00:21:27.926 --> 00:21:31.894 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.894 --> 00:21:35.366 align:middle line:90%
[RAIN]

00:21:35.366 --> 00:21:42.806 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.806 --> 00:21:46.278 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:46.278 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
In the world of the Celts,
there exist many traditions

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
of doorways into the
Otherworld, a number of which

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
are identified with
the ancient world

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:84%
"sacra," which means
"illuminated being"

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:90%
and "paradise."

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
At the core of the Otherworld
tradition in Scotland

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
is a pyramidal mountain
called Schiehallion meaning,

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:90%
"the Hill of the Fairy Realm."

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
2/3 of the way up lies a hidden
chamber the Celts peopled

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
with supernatural
beings, its folklore

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:84%
committed to paper by the local
19th century parish priest.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
"There is a very remarkable
cave near the southwest

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
angle of Schiehallion
a cave of the giant.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Some miles to the east,
there is an opening

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:84%
in the face of a rock
which is believed

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:90%
to be the termination thereof.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Several stories told and
believed by the credulous

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
relating to this cave,
that the inside thereof

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is full of chambers
or separate apartments

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and that as soon as a
person advances a few yards,

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.730 align:middle line:84%
he comes to a door which,
the moment he enters,

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:84%
closes as it opened,
of its own accord,

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and prevents his returning."

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
The only people known to have
frequented this abode of fairy

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
folk were those initiated
into the secrets of nature,

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
a tradition traced back to a
group of hermit monks named

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
the Caldee, a branch of the
spiritual bloodline descending

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
from the Essenes and other
gnostics, all of whom

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.500 align:middle line:84%
share the same
tradition of initiation

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:90%
and living resurrection.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Like the Egyptians, the
Celts consider the Otherworld

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to be a location
whose time and space

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
differs from the
physical world, and yet

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
utterly intertwines
with it, just occupying

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:90%
a different dimension.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the lords that
governed the Celtic Otherworld

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:90%
is Nectan.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:84%
There is a sacred cave dedicated
to him in a secluded valley

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:90%
in Cornwall.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:84%
It is located at
the crossing of two

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth's energy currents.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Until the fifth century,
druids would live here

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
in splendid isolation,
seeking an experience

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:90%
of the Otherworld.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Their quests would
often last years.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Latter day pilgrims
still journey here hoping

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to reach more distant horizons.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they carve their
meditations and wishes

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:90%
in the stone.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Further along the valley, there
is another energy hot spot

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
marked by an ancient labyrinth,
the symbol of the opposing

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
forces of dark and
light that must

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.055 align:middle line:84%
be reconciled before
the pilgrim can

00:24:38.055 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:90%
venture into the Otherworld.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Some people are known
to stay here overnight

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:90%
to try it for themselves.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:84%
In Welsh mythology,
the Otherworld

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
is called Annwfn, also
known as [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:90%
"The castle of the fairies."

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Much like the Egyptian Amduat,
it is described as a world

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:90%
of essential delights.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Entry into this
garden of enchantment

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
is possible through a shamanic
initiation while living.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And to facilitate it, the Celts
built countless structures,

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:84%
many with dark inner
chambers covered with earth,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:84%
resembling man-made caves,
the most common types

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:84%
being the passage
mound and the dolmen.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
The practice was so pervasive
that dolmens are found

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:84%
from Ireland to North
Africa and across Asia,

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:84%
with the Korean
peninsula boasting

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
the greatest concentration
anywhere in the world.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of where these
enigmatic structures appear,

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:90%
they are united by one element.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
They all occur along the
crossing points of the Earth's

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.381 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic currents.

00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
No wonder the Celts
regarded them as places

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
set aside from the normal
world as though separated

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:90%
by a force field.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Each site is guarded by
beings said to continue

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:90%
living in spirit form.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
On occasion, they present
themselves to the living

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:84%
when they meditate at sacred
places such as the stone circle

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:20.140 align:middle line:84%
at Uragh, nestled high on a
mountain overlooking a lake

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and framed by waterfalls, where
the apparition of an extremely

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
tall woman clad in
a kind of light silk

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:84%
appears to visitors who travel
here on spiritual quests.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It is one of many places where
contact with the Otherworld

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:35.685 align:middle line:90%
can be experienced.

00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
In central Ireland, the
place for connecting

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.440 align:middle line:84%
with the Otherworld
is Schlieb Mikili

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Beara, also known as Lockgrew.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.530 align:middle line:84%
The hill is named for
the central goddess

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of the Celtic creation myth
whose depiction in blue-green

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
makes her the equivalent of
those other gods of living

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:90%
resurrection, Shiva and Osiris.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:84%
One of Schlieb Mikili
Beara's 300 impressive mounds

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:84%
is a chamber filled with carved
stones immediately identifying

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.791 align:middle line:84%
it as a room once used for
visualization and out of body

00:27:13.791 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:90%
journeying.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:84%
The chamber receives
its direct sunlight

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
on two occasions, the sunrise
marking Sawan, the day when

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
the veil with the Otherworld
is thinnest, and sunrise

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.480 align:middle line:84%
at Imbolc, the day dedicated
to the goddess Brigid,

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:84%
a triple goddess of knowledge,
the arts, and illumination.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
As such, she is the
counterpart of Djehuti,

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian deity who
presides at the threshold

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:90%
into the Otherworld.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Brigid's Celtic name is Bride,
the root of the word "bride,"

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's not by accident
that the rooms used

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.280 align:middle line:84%
specifically for
reaching the Otherworld

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.645 align:middle line:90%
are called bridal chambers.

00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:84%
This particular bridal chamber
is now an island, since cut off

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.300 align:middle line:84%
from the land by rising
seas, demonstrating

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.240 align:middle line:84%
just how ancient these places
and practices really are.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.345 align:middle line:84%
Another lies on the remote
Scottish island of Lewis.

00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
The stone circle of
Callanish is unique

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:84%
insofar as it is
connected by four

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
avenues of glistening
gneiss, each

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:90%
aligned to the cardinal points.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.526 align:middle line:84%
except one, which
faces the northeast,

00:28:41.526 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:84%
the direction associated
with illumination

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and ancient wisdom,
the very benefits

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:90%
of traveling to the Otherworld.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.845 align:middle line:84%
This detail gives away one
of its original functions,

00:28:52.845 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:84%
for although there is no
doubt Callanish references

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
significant astronomical
events, there once

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:84%
existed a superfluous beehive
shaped cairn in the center

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
featuring an underground
chamber facing east,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
the direction associated
with resurrection.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:90%
There was no trace of burial.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
However, the anomalous
avenue of stones

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
once extended a mile further
to a second underground chamber

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:90%
which also faces east.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It appears that Callanish
served a ritual purpose where

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:84%
a person prepared at one site,
walked the ceremonial route

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to be initiated inside the
cave-like bridal chamber

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.220 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the circle.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:84%
This scenario would be familiar
to someone visiting from Egypt,

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
especially Saqqara,
where the very same

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
journey was taken by
candidates preparing

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to enter the Otherworld.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:56.075 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.075 --> 00:29:58.165 align:middle line:84%
When entering these
temples, there

00:29:58.165 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
is a distinct feeling of
crossing into another reality.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:06.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The Celts regarded the
Otherworld as a place separated

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
from the normal world as
though by a forcefield,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and they defined it
symbolically as an island

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:84%
in the west, an overseas
paradise of nature spirits

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.120 align:middle line:84%
where the ancestors live
immortally in a state of bliss

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and into which mortals
can be admitted,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.090 align:middle line:84%
having gained the trust of
the guardian of the temple

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.680 align:middle line:90%
and given the proper training.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, mortals
allowed into the spirit

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:90%
realm did so while still alive.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.260 align:middle line:84%
This island is the
same westerly realm

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:84%
to where Egyptian initiates
embarked during their journey

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.470 align:middle line:90%
into the Otherworld.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It is the kingdom the dying sun
descends into during the night,

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:90%
the shadow world.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And both cultures
believed it was situated

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.260 align:middle line:84%
not in some unknown
distant territory,

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
but beside the physical
world, merely whisper

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.540 align:middle line:90%
away in another dimension.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.790 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:84%
One such island lives off
the west coast of England.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
For over 2,000 years, Tintagel
has been a place where people

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:84%
prepare to embark
on a journey even

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:84%
more endless than
the visible horizon.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.780 align:middle line:84%
A cave runs through the
entire length, dedicated

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.070 align:middle line:90%
to the magician Merlin.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Here, initiates
entered the Otherworld

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:84%
from the west, immersed
themselves in total darkness

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to confront their
greatest fears,

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:90%
and emerged reborn in the east.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It even sits on
magnetic anomaly,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.690 align:middle line:84%
giving the palpable
aura of a place set

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:90%
aside from the normal world.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Up to the fifth
century, Tintagel island

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
drew people from as far
as the Mediterranean,

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:90%
searching for spiritual renewal.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:84%
The clue to unlocking
its secret lies across

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:84%
on the mainland, a rare
church dedicated to Mater

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Anne, the mother of the gods.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Beside it lies an ancient
mound beneath which

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:84%
was discovered a large polygonal
chamber aligned east-west.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:84%
It contained a cache
of valuable goods

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
from southeast
Turkey, but no body.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:84%
How odd that tomb robbers
should choose necrophilia

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:90%
over the precious items.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:middle line:84%
There is also an unusual stone
used for aligning the Great

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Bear and the pole star that
rises above Tintagel island

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.060 align:middle line:84%
when the sun is reborn
on the winter solstice.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:84%
According to indigenous
traditions around the world,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
souls incarnate
from the pole star

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and travel along an invisible
tube to and from the Earth.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.880 align:middle line:84%
This tradition is remembered
in a local folktale that claims

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Tintagel is the site
of a fairy castle

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:84%
whose gate appears twice
a year, on each solstice.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.200 align:middle line:10%
But Tintagel's most famous
association with the Otherworld

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.610 align:middle line:10%
is the myth of King
Arthur and the grail.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:10%
It is an adaptation of the
Egyptian Resurrection myth

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:10%
with Arthur playing
the role of Osiris,

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:10%
his evil brother Mordred
as Set, and Merlin

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:10%
as Djehuti, the god of wisdom.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.670 align:middle line:84%
It is also a reworking
of earlier Celtic legends

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
about a hero's journey of
self discovery whereupon

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.030 align:middle line:90%
he weds a divine virgin.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Arthur is a composition
fifth century

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:90%
king, part real, part myth.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It may not even have
been a real name,

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
but a title, given
that "arth fawr"

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is Welsh for "Great Bear,"
the constellation bearing

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:90%
the pole star in his time.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Like other resurrected
god-men, Arthur's birth

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to a virgin queen is
magically conceived.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.855 align:middle line:84%
He marries a beautiful
maiden whose dowry brings him

00:34:02.855 --> 00:34:06.739 align:middle line:84%
to a round table while his
12 battles are analogies

00:34:06.739 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:84%
of the stages of initiation
into the mysteries

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:84%
as well as the passage of
the sun through the houses

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:90%
of the zodiac.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the story portrays
the cycle of life and rebirth,

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:22.380 align:middle line:84%
least of all because it is
rich in allegorical references

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:84%
of transcending ordinary
consciousness through a journey

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.500 align:middle line:90%
into a mystical land.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.850 align:middle line:84%
The experience is
what empowers the hero

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:84%
to overcome the obstacles
of the physical world.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:36.117 align:middle line:90%
[WAVES CRASHING]

00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:90%


00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:40.739 align:middle line:84%
On the summit of Tintagel
is Arthur's footprint,

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.429 align:middle line:90%
carved into the living stone.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.239 align:middle line:84%
It marks the ritual site
for resurrecting the power

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:49.830 align:middle line:84%
of the ruler at moment the
sun rises above the horizon

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.910 align:middle line:90%
on December the 21st.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It also marks the path of
an Earth energy currency

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and forms an alignment with the
church and the winter solstice

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:90%
sunrise.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.750 align:middle line:84%
An identical mark exists
on the sacred hill

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:84%
of Dunadd in Scotland
where divine kingship

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:90%
was similarly consecrated.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:84%
It too marks the winter
solstice sunrise.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.380 align:middle line:84%
A few yards from
Arthur's footprint

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.820 align:middle line:84%
is a ritual chamber that
once held a baptismal pool

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:90%
at its western entrance.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:84%

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Inside, two doors
offer a choice.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Those who chose the left door
found their progress impeded.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Only those who
choose the right door

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.000 align:middle line:84%
were led to a
secret chamber where

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.670 align:middle line:90%
the final ritual was conducted.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:84%
This simple teaching
illustrated the limitation

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.930 align:middle line:84%
of using logical left
brain thinking to access

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.430 align:middle line:90%
the Otherworld and its wisdom.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Only the intuitive right
brain will get you there.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.490 align:middle line:84%
This esoteric belief was still
being taught by the philosopher

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:56.561 align:middle line:84%
Zeno at his mystery school
in Greece thousands of years

00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:57.260 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu was by no
means the only place

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:09.290 align:middle line:84%
for entering the
Otherworld At Sillustani

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:84%
stand these unusual
towers called chulpas.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.710 align:middle line:84%
The massive curved
stones are so well

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.790 align:middle line:84%
fitted than an
alpaca hair cannot

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:90%
be inserted between them.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:25.715 align:middle line:84%
Later towers are fitted to
a similar high standard,

00:45:25.715 --> 00:45:28.130 align:middle line:84%
but finished in
more linear fashion

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:31.120 align:middle line:90%
as though by a cosmic draftsman.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.150 align:middle line:84%
The structures are described
as Uta Amaya, "houses

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of the soul," not
"for the soul,"

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.320 align:middle line:84%
indicating they may
originally have been used

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.400 align:middle line:90%
for ritual rather than burial.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
One 16th century historian
suspected the towers were later

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:84%
reused for burial
during Inca times,

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.090 align:middle line:84%
but originally served
a ritual purpose.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.730 align:middle line:90%
He may be right.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:84%
When one of the towers
partially collapsed,

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.140 align:middle line:84%
it revealed how the core
masonry was designed

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.130 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of a beehive.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.010 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Also, they are only accessible
through a tiny rectangular

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:10.150 align:middle line:84%
doorway, forcing even
the smallest of people

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to scramble on all
fours as though made

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.640 align:middle line:84%
to enter the
structure in a state

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.470 align:middle line:84%
of humility, one of
the prerequisites

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.580 align:middle line:90%
for entering the Otherworld.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And just like temples
used for similar purposes,

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.100 align:middle line:84%
every entrance on every chulpa
is oriented precisely east.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:35.000 align:middle line:84%
More structures
appear at Kutimbo.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:84%
If you happen to be
standing by the main tower

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:84%
when the sun is at its zenith,
something wondrous occurs.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.870 align:middle line:84%
The light reveals
relief carvings

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.180 align:middle line:84%
above the doorway of what
appears to be a male and female

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
figure, the symbolic
coupling of the initiate

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:90%
with his celestial bride.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:58.110 align:middle line:84%
There also come into view the
reliefs of two large dogs,

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.830 align:middle line:84%
which at first seems an
unusual choice of creature

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to carve at the entrance
to a ritual chamber,

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.090 align:middle line:84%
but not to the Aymara, who
taught that a soul experiencing

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:12.254 align:middle line:84%
living resurrection undergoes
an ordeal as it winds

00:47:12.254 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:90%
its way to the Otherworld.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The Andean account of
this afterlife journey

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.800 align:middle line:84%
uses the symbol of a bridge
across a raging river.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And as a soul crosses the river,
it is assisted by black dogs

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.420 align:middle line:90%
capable of seeing in the dark.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The story find its
parallel in the hounds

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.750 align:middle line:84%
of Hades of the
Greek mystery schools

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and Anubis, the guide of the
soul in the Egyptian temple.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the
ancient city of Cuzco,

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.320 align:middle line:84%
there are reminders
that it was once

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.250 align:middle line:84%
a megalithic site
built to standards far

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.410 align:middle line:90%
beyond our modern technology.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:58.890 align:middle line:90%


00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:01.580 align:middle line:84%
"Cuzco" means "navel
of the Earth,"

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and the title defines
its importance

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:04.590 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.190 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:09.860 align:middle line:84%
High above the hills
that cradle Cuzco lies

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.430 align:middle line:84%
an impressive megalithic
site spread across 50 acres

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.600 align:middle line:90%
called Sacsayhuaman.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.070 align:middle line:84%
It means "place of
the satisfied falcon."

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Before the Spanish conquistadors
destroyed much of it

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:26.790 align:middle line:84%
for building material,
it featured a second wall

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that from the air gave this
sacred site the impression

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:33.070 align:middle line:90%
of a pair of wings.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Since the falcon is a reference
to the Egyptian god Khepri,

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.930 align:middle line:84%
the very symbol of rebirth,
it identifies the temple

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.370 align:middle line:84%
as a place where one
would come to be reborn,

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:46.120 align:middle line:84%
although how the Egyptian
connection came to be here

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:90%
is still a mystery.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:50.970 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Secret tunnels still attest to
Sacsayhuaman's ritual function

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.585 align:middle line:84%
and connection with
underground caves.

00:48:56.585 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But the atmosphere
of Sacsayhuaman

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.660 align:middle line:84%
is transcended by that
of a small temple a mile

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to the east, an eroded limestone
mound carved inside and out

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:13.540 align:middle line:84%
with ledges, passageways,
stairs that lead nowhere,

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.760 align:middle line:90%
and the ritual cave.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.830 align:middle line:84%
It's Quechuan name is Q'inqu
meaning "zigzag," the pattern

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.340 align:middle line:90%
carved above the chamber.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.080 align:middle line:84%
This archetypal design
appears throughout the world

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.110 align:middle line:84%
in sacred places where the
earth's energy pathways flow

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and where people conducted
out of body journeys.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:35.410 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Q'inqu was locally
described as the entrance

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.450 align:middle line:84%
into the Otherworld and its
underground chamber is accessed

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:44.330 align:middle line:84%
by a passage that,
just like in Tintagel,

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:47.340 align:middle line:84%
was deliberately carved
out of solid rock to face

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:84%
west, the direction of ritual
descent into the Otherworld.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Inside, the chamber
meanders like an S,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the limestone skillfully
sculpted into a series

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.700 align:middle line:84%
of polished ledges
where one could

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.170 align:middle line:84%
spend a very comfortable
night immersed

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:05.950 align:middle line:90%
in a womb-like setting.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.930 align:middle line:84%
The chamber exits
to the east and

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.505 align:middle line:84%
into a bowl-shaped courtyard
that holds the equinox sunrise.

00:50:11.505 --> 00:50:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.050 align:middle line:84%
A nine hour bus ride
through the Andes

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:25.830 align:middle line:84%
brings you to a sandstone massif
on the edge of Lake Titicaca.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Once, it was an island
resembling a teardrop.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.610 align:middle line:84%
The tectonic shifts
that plague this region

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:34.300 align:middle line:84%
have tilted the bedrock
a full 90 degrees,

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.940 align:middle line:84%
leaving the red stone
exposed to the elements.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.820 align:middle line:84%
The hill is called
Hayu Marca, literally,

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:90%
"the gate of the spirits."

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And long ago, nameless people
carved a monumental portal

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and called it Amaru Muru.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.810 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The oldest legend describes
Amaru Muru as a doorway

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to the lands of the
gods and how in times

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.850 align:middle line:84%
long past, great heroes
passed through this gate

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:04.340 align:middle line:84%
for a glorious new life of
immortality in the Otherworld.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.680 align:middle line:84%
The doorway faces the
rising equinox sun.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.690 align:middle line:84%
In the Quechuan language,
"amaru" means "serpent."

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:15.870 align:middle line:84%
It identifies the site as a
conduit for the Earth's energy

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.740 align:middle line:84%
currents, which together
with the high content of iron

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.320 align:middle line:84%
in the rock leaves an
immediate impression

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.160 align:middle line:90%
on anyone who comes here.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Local people often report
a blue light emanating

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.680 align:middle line:84%
from a tunnel inside
the rock or people

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.360 align:middle line:84%
dressed in unusual closing
emerging from this portal.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And yet Amaru Muru is an
identical concept to the spirit

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:84%
doors found in
Egyptian chambers which

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:43.210 align:middle line:84%
were carved so that the
soul may enter and leave

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.520 align:middle line:90%
the Otherworld at will.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Amaru Muru has a twin on the
opposite side of the world

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.560 align:middle line:90%
at Yazilikaya in Turkey.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The site has been incorrectly
identified as the resting place

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.520 align:middle line:84%
of Midas, the fabled king who
turned everything he touched

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.700 align:middle line:84%
into gold, although his
body was never found here,

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.630 align:middle line:84%
nor is it likely to
be, because "Mida" is

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:12.340 align:middle line:84%
the surname of the
goddess Cybele,

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.430 align:middle line:84%
a local adaptation of
Demeter, the presiding

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:17.650 align:middle line:84%
goddess of the Greek
mystery schools

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and its ritual of
living resurrection.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And just like Amaru
Muru, a doorway

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.740 align:middle line:84%
on the summit carved out
of the bedrock in the shape

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:30.690 align:middle line:84%
of a beehive descends
900 feet into the chamber

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:33.451 align:middle line:84%
where rituals into the
Otherworld were once conducted.

00:52:33.451 --> 00:52:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:41.470 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the people who
journeyed to the Otherworld?

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:45.000 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
knowledge they gained?

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Did their ideas help
reshape society?

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And what became of the
portals they once used?

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, despite
the persecution

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.560 align:middle line:84%
by orthodox religion,
the mystical practices

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of the mystery schools were
resurrected in the 12th century

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.360 align:middle line:84%
In the westernmost
point of Europe

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.790 align:middle line:84%
lies a mountain aligned
east-west where a people called

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:15.930 align:middle line:90%
the Offusa once worshipped.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:19.090 align:middle line:84%
The name means "people
of the serpent."

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:24.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they worked with
the Earth energy and its ways.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Here on the mountain of Sintra
they erected countless temples

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to the lunar goddess
Sin, from whom

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:33.890 align:middle line:90%
the mountain gets its name.

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:38.120 align:middle line:84%
They were real sinners in
the true meaning of the word.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.770 align:middle line:90%
She is also known as Isis.

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:42.390 align:middle line:90%


00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Two megalithic temples

This one faces the Atlantic
Ocean and the setting sun

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:49.728 align:middle line:90%

00:53:52.486 --> 00:53:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It was once a doorway
into the Otherworld.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It is said that a tunnel
leads through the mountains

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.390 align:middle line:84%
to the second temple
on the east side,

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.140 align:middle line:90%
which faces the rising sun.

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It was designed as
the ultimate test

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.440 align:middle line:84%
for an initiate walking
in darkness like his soul

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.400 align:middle line:90%

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Since then, all kinds of
seekers have come here

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.190 align:middle line:84%
to experience the Otherworld,
building solitary chambers

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and caverns to escape the
turmoil and distraction

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.350 align:middle line:90%

nearby out of natural
stone and found their way

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:12.425 align:middle line:84%
to this inter-dimensional

But one group of
monks in particular

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.950 align:middle line:84%
not only came here all
the way from Jerusalem

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to create this country
called Portugal,

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.580 align:middle line:84%
they also resuscitated
the ancient tradition

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.530 align:middle line:84%
of raising the
dead by rebuilding

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:31.860 align:middle line:84%

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.040 align:middle line:90%
a few flourishes of their own.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.400 align:middle line:84%
These monks of the
Cistercian order

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.860 align:middle line:84%
would eventually be known
as the Knights Templar.

One of their main
places of veneration

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.760 align:middle line:84%
was the mountain of
Monsanto, the sacred mount.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Here they practiced
their rituals

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:04.270 align:middle line:84%
using false graves cut out of
living rock in which initiates

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.190 align:middle line:84%
would lie in a near death
state while their soul

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.060 align:middle line:90%
traveled to the Otherworld.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.910 align:middle line:10%
The graves appear on the
west slope of the mountain.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:16.330 align:middle line:84%
As they woke in the morning,
they would find themselves

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:19.470 align:middle line:84%
in another grave in
the east on the summit

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:20.810 align:middle line:90%
facing the rising sun.

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were not
the first people here.

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:45.020 align:middle line:84%
By their time, it was already
an ancient sacred site,

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.380 align:middle line:84%
the center marked by
a boulder resembling

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic egg upon which is
carved the symbol of a womb.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The Templars built a castle
around this ritual stone

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.950 align:middle line:90%
and protected the site.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.090 align:middle line:84%
They were sensitive
to the tradition

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.960 align:middle line:84%
because they shaped the
wall so that the first light

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.287 align:middle line:84%
of the equinox sunrise falls
precisely on this rock.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
curious feature beneath it.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:20.530 align:middle line:84%
At first sight, what appears
to be a well is in fact

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:23.740 align:middle line:84%
a ritual chamber where a
person could be immersed

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.640 align:middle line:90%
in a womb-like environment.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:34.660 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The Templars' most mysterious
center of initiation

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.700 align:middle line:84%
was back in Sintra
in a place once known

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:44.230 align:middle line:84%
as the Forest of Angels, an
ancient sacred grove where

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.110 align:middle line:90%
the mysteries were taught.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The property was bought at
the end of the 19th century

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:53.550 align:middle line:84%
by a member of the Freemasons,
the progeny of the Templars,

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:55.890 align:middle line:84%
who painstakingly
rebuilt the sides

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and left symbols
throughout its landscape

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to arouse interest of the
mysteries in future seekers.

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.240 align:middle line:90%


00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.470 align:middle line:84%

gods, goddesses, symbols

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.580 align:middle line:90%
dealing with secret teachings.

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:16.270 align:middle line:10%
There is even an underground
river imitating the mythical

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.750 align:middle line:10%
River Styx, the body of water
the soul of the initiate

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:24.250 align:middle line:10%
must cross safely in order
to reach the other world.

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But most mysterious of all
are the endless subterranean

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.630 align:middle line:84%
passages once used by
initiates as they imitated

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:35.410 align:middle line:84%
the path of the soul of Osiris

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.780 align:middle line:84%
through the darkness and towards
the light of the Otherworld.

There are even small
nooks where a person

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.200 align:middle line:84%
can sit in deep
meditation, seeking

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.000 align:middle line:90%
an inner experience of God.

their most important ritual

a strange carving of a dog

and a lion on the church wall.

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The dog represents Sirius,
the star of ancient wisdom

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and the first shining light
the initiates in ancient times

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%

or herself with greater
certainty while living.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
The gnostic gospels describe
the benefit behind this pursuit

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
almost 2,000 years
ago, how there

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
are two antagonistic forces
at work in the world,

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
the god of light,
right action, and love,

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and the god of darkness, whose
primary aim is to frustrate

01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:45.460 align:middle line:84%
the attainment of
such positive forces

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.780 align:middle line:84%
by making people drink of
the waters of forgetfulness

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.610 align:middle line:84%
in order that they might not
know the origin of their soul.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:56.970 align:middle line:90%


01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.750 align:middle line:84%
The purpose shared
by all esoteric sects

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
was to liberate humans
from this ensnarement

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
by initiating them into
the cult of knowledge.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And the technique was a shamanic
journey into the underworld.

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:14.820 align:middle line:90%


01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Although our journey has dealt
with matters of ages long gone,

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:20.200 align:middle line:90%
it's appeal is timely.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.880 align:middle line:84%
More and more people are
shunning major world religions

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
because their core has
been revealed to be hollow

01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
or the message
hijacked by extremists.

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
People are rejecting
communal prayer

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.410 align:middle line:84%
for personal
introspection, ironically

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
imitating the very essence of
the hermit's solitary search

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
for self discovery,
because as humans,

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
we long for spiritual
rejuvenation

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.005 align:middle line:84%
and direct experience
of purpose.

01:04:47.005 --> 01:04:51.540 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
The aim of the knowledge
gained from the experience

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Otherworld was to
assist people transcend

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
their perceived
helplessness by making

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
them take an active role in
their conscious manifestation

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:04.870 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Because all forms all
interconnected in the material

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and the ethereal
worlds, a person

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
armed with an understanding
of cosmic laws

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
can influence the
outcome of forces

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.940 align:middle line:90%
taking place in both worlds.

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.210 align:middle line:84%
They can become masters
of their own reality

01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:21.870 align:middle line:90%
rather than being victims of it.

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:24.660 align:middle line:90%


01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the gift and goal
of reaching the Otherworld

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
is to discover the
freedom of conscience

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
precisely as the suppressed
gospel of Thomas reminds us.

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
"Whoever finds himself is
superior to the world."

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:42.700 align:middle line:90%
