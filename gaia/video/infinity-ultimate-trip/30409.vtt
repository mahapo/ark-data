00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.595 align:middle line:84%
>>The point of all of the great
spiritual teachings is

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that you can step into infinity
today, reside in

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
infinity consciously, and
source from there.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Within infinity, you will become
the architect and the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:84%
dreamer of the great matrix of
expression and creation.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do that, then you
are caught in someone else's

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
dream and someone else's
nightmare.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
The practice of infinity is
really about dreaming your

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.834 align:middle line:90%
world into being.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>People have to understand
that there is no death.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
A person like me, who's been
dead, has no choice but to see

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:90%
it this way.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
The end of something is
just the beginning

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.250 align:middle line:90%
of something else.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
There is no finite.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And once you see yourself as a
spiritual being, forget it.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
A near death experience or any
thought of it is completely

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
impossible and totally out
of my framework in 1975.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have believed it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have gotten me to
believe it, except I was

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
talking on the telephone on
a Wednesday afternoon.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.185 align:middle line:84%
Lightning hit the phone line and
came down, and it hit me

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:90%
in the side of my head.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It went down my spine and it
welded the nails of the heels

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
of my shoes to the nails in the
floor, which grounded me,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
threw me in the air, suspended
me in the air and slammed me

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:90%
down on the bed.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I was dead for 28 minutes,
completely paralyzed for six

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
days, partially paralyzed
for seven months.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It took me two years to learn
to walk and feed myself.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.955 align:middle line:84%
>>I was born 1924 in a little
town called Breig.

00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather owned two large
textile mills, the length of a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:90%
whole street.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And the whole town worked
for them, weaving.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
There were two brothers,
Otto and Fritz.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Fritz was my uncle and Otto
my father, and they

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
each ran one mill--

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:84%
one in Freistadt and
one in Breig.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And we were very rich.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And then came the
Nazis, age 33.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.055 align:middle line:84%
And the very first thing they
did was shoot my father on New

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Year's Eve through the window.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>I was lying down on my
bed one night around

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:90%
15 or 18 years ago.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I had just had a terrific
argument with my then wife,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:90%
God rest her soul.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:84%
She's celebrated her
continuation day.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And we had had some kind of a
spat about nothing, really.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Most spats are about nothing--

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
whose turn was it to take out
the trash or whatever.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:90%
But I was in a mood of upset.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:90%
So I was lying on my bed.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.462 align:middle line:90%
I had gone to bed quite early.

00:03:38.462 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I just slammed the door
to the bedroom.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I was there just to get
away from it all.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.156 align:middle line:84%
And as I got into the bedroom,
I realized what am

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:90%
I going to do here?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It's 7:45 at night.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready to go to sleep.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I had no television in the
bedroom, and as it happened,

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.605 align:middle line:84%
no reading material
on that occasion.

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow, boy.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.846 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll just try
to go to sleep.

00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So I turned the lights out
and I lie there in the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
semi-darkness of
a 7:45 evening.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I allowed myself to
just let go of everything,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
because I remember thinking,
why can't

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.835 align:middle line:90%
people just get along?

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so hard?

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I see now why nations can't
get along with nations and

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.625 align:middle line:84%
civilizations with civilizations
and cultures

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:90%
with cultures.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.115 align:middle line:84%
I can't even get along with my
own wife, who I love dearly.

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:84%
What does it take just
to simply get along?

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.358 align:middle line:84%
And I remember feeling
so sad about that.

00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>The first time that
I died, I was six.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I became very ill and needed
massive blood transfusions.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have a very rare blood
type, B negative.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And we could not find donors.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And I spent a week in a coma
while they found donors with

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:90%
my blood type.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
My body was being wracked
by fever.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was extremely painful
to be inside my body.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember lifting up from
my body and going to the

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
corner of the room and hovering
in the corner of the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
room, shivering and saying,
who is that little boy?

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And why is he so sad?

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Why is he crying?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Why is he not be able to open
his eyes, and going back to

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.420 align:middle line:84%
the lying down next to him
and feeling the pain.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The closer I got to that little
body, the more pain I

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:90%
could feel.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would withdraw to the
corner of the room.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>But what happened was at the
point where I could no longer

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.021 align:middle line:84%
sustain the burning of my body--
my eyes hurt, and it

00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
was like I had consumed battery
acid and I'm burning

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.545 align:middle line:84%
and I'm on fire-- then I
lift out of my body.

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:47.453 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in this blue-grey
place.

00:05:47.453 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't care where it was.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It was better than where
I just left.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel this sense of
comfort and sense of safety.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Then I had this point of where
I was listening to these

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:90%
chimes and this music.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, this
blue grey place became a

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:90%
tunnel of light.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.165 align:middle line:84%
And I moved down this tunnel,
and I came into

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:90%
this place of light.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching what was
going on around me.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And the sensations and the
beauty of this place totally

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
distracted me from the world
I had just left.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to say that some
people are enlightened.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I was in lightning.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>And suddenly, I
was accompanied

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:90%
by beings, by angels.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I call them angels because
they were luminous.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They were translucent
white that held me.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:90%
And I asked them, who are you?

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:90%
I was scared at the beginning.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we are
your parents.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
We are your real parents,
your true parents.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And who is that little
boy, I asked.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:90%
They said, that's you.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's not always
been you.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>Nazism now was
in full bloom.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:90%
It was '34.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it was '35, 1935,
and it was the many, many

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:90%
restrictions against the Jews.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
It got worse and worse
and worse.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The end, they came and they
loaded up 35 old ladies and a

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
few old men and my mother and
took them to Auschwitz.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Before that, my mother heard
that there was such a thing as

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:84%
a children's transport,
the Kindertransport.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
They rescued 5,000
Jewish children.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:90%
They took some to Holland.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
They didn't survive.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that were in the
back of the train they took to

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
England, and because we
were late, we were in

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:90%
the back of the train.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I'm here.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:90%
This is why I'm still alive.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>So I lied there in the bed,
and I just sunk back into

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
hopelessness is how I would
describe the moment--

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
sunk back into
what's-the-use-ness.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I fell asleep as all
the energy drained from me.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.805 align:middle line:84%
But as I was falling asleep, I
had the very clear experience,

00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
the very clear knowing, that I
was about to have the deepest

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.975 align:middle line:90%
sleep of my life.

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:33.696 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, I experienced
myself being

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:90%
sucked off the bed.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I've described this to close
ones as the feeling that a fly

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
might have if we saw the fly on
some surface and managed to

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.725 align:middle line:84%
get a vacuum cleaner hose over
that fly fast enough.

00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:51.323 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, OK,
turn it on.

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:90%
[SUCKING SOUND]

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling fly must
have if that were to

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:90%
happen was how I felt.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I felt literally sucked
up off the bed.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:07.576 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I looked down,
and there I was on the bed.

00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:08.525 align:middle line:90%
And I looked strange.

00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:90%
I looked very strange.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And I knew instantly that
that was not me.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, my.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought all this while
that I was that.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
but if I'm not

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:90%
that, then who am I?

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>After you enter this place of
light, you have a panoramic

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:90%
life review.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is the single
most important thing

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that anyone could learn other
than please do not

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:90%
be afraid of death.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>When you die, you go through
a life review process, where

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
you review all of the incidents
of your lifetime

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that are emotionally charged,
positive or negative, every

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
single person you spoke badly
to, harshly to, every single

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
person that you helped
and you loved--

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
but not only in this lifetime,
but of every lifetime that you

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:90%
have lived.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You review everything and
everyone that you have been,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and at that time, have the
opportunity of shedding the

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:90%
karma from all of those lives.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that in the West,
we do not know how to

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:90%
die consciously.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So we don't take up the
opportunity at that moment of

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
awakening to shed all of the
momentum of those histories

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and then bring them with us into
our next incarnation in

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:90%
our next lifetime.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Anybody who thinks there's
not a life after death is

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:90%
stupid, end of story.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been through three
of these experiences.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
But then you have this panoramic
life review-- the

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.830 align:middle line:84%
great book of judgment, the
hall of records, where all

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
things are written, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You will see your entire life
pass before you in a 360

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:90%
degree panorama.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.770 align:middle line:90%
You have missed nothing.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
You will watch it from a second
person point of view as

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:90%
if you were your best friend--

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
the personality I think
I try to convey

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:90%
today in everyday life.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>The life review process is an
opportunity for atonement

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness, of draining the
charge in the momentum of

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
all of your actions.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It is not a day of judgment.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It is not a place for you
to explain yourself.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you are the judge,
the jury, the defending

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:90%
attorney, and the defendant.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
If you can find forgiveness,
that life

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:90%
review passes like that.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, you want to do
that before you die.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>I kept having psychic
incidences.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:90%
It started to happen.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.955 align:middle line:90%
I was about--

00:11:37.955 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:90%
how old was I then?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:90%
16, 17?

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:90%
17.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I began to see things.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But then I didn't think
much of it.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.675 align:middle line:84%
>>Before we have a dream, we go
through sleeping process,

00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:90%
deep sleep process.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.768 align:middle line:84%
That in itself is a very good
practice of rehearsal,

00:12:03.768 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
practice of dying, death
and dying process.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:84%
The way we sleep, when we sleep
and lie down, how our

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
consciousness withdraws
inwardly, how our experiences

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
of perceptions and thoughts
become dreamlike in fading and

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
then slowly, slowly, sinking
inwardly into the base

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:90%
consciousness--

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and then we go blank.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>And so I left and went
to London from V-Day.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have just left.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I just went, took the bus,
and went to London.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I got there on the day when
victory was declared.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And all of the cars were
hooting and tooting.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I went into that little tiny
restaurant, which was a hole

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.565 align:middle line:90%
in the wall, in Swiss Cottage.

00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:90%
You know London?

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And I went right in there and
the tables were all empty.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
There must have been
six tables.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a small place.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I sat down at one of the empty
tables in my uniform.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And in walked this tall man
who was very pale who was

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
wearing a blue Air Force
officer's uniform.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down at my table
and with all the

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:90%
empties all around me.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And he said, hello, Renate.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, hello.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:90%
How do you know my name?

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know everything
about you.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying
to be adorable.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, is it good?

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Is it bad?

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:90%
It was all of 20.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I came as
a message for you.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like television.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:90%
But I said, what is it?

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, your whole
family is dead.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:90%
They're all dead.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Your mother's dead.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Your father's dead.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's dead except
your sister and you.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe that the soul
incarnates in the body for the

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
lessons that we need
to learn here.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And I think it is choice.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if there's
timeline-- if you can come

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
right back or if there's
a wait period.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Many people say to me, John, how
do I know that when I pass

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
away, my mother's going
to be there?

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:90%
She didn't reincarnate.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I learned an analogy
from another medium.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Look at it this way.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:90%
You have a hard drive.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That's your oversoul.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And that John Holland program
spits out and is

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:90%
playing right now.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So when I pass away, when I
leave this body, that John

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Holland program ceases to play
and goes back into the

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
database, goes back into
the hard drive.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Another piece of my soul
will come down.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But that piece of that John
Holland program will always be

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:90%
there in the database.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think we come back just for
our soul progression, to

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
keep learning lessons, because
this is the place to do it.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes--

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and I often joke and say, I
think the people on the other

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
side, when I say,
you know what?

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to Earth
and learn more lessons.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes, the people
on the other side say, why?

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is life.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:90%
This is the school of life.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you learn
all your lessons.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And what better place for the
soul to learn than being this

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:84%
dense, molecular-- it's
tough being in here.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we
learn our lessons.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we leave the spirit
world, I think they say

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
goodbye to us, but they
say hello to us here.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's time for us
to pass, the people here

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
mourn, and those on the other
side, they celebrate and say

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.320 align:middle line:90%
welcome back.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>And then they showed
me who I had been.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.460 align:middle line:84%
They took me through former
lifetimes, through a past life

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
regression in which I was
there personally,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:90%
feeling it, living it.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I was in the desert feeling
the desert sand

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:90%
blowing in my face.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I was in the jungle feeling
the sweat in my body.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I was a woman giving birth.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I was drowning in the ocean.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I was being killed in battle.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I was being taken
away as a child.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them, who
are these people?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And they said, they have
also been you.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But you're not any
of them, either.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
They're just the experiences
you've had.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>I was pulled out
of the room.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.386 align:middle line:84%
And I flew out of that
room like lightning.

00:16:19.386 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was, in fact, in a tunnel,
in fact, racing toward

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:84%
a light at the end
of this tunnel.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was going at some
insane speed.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Things were flying by me-- just
the shadows and the light

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
flowing in this tunnel, so fast
I knew I must be going a

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:90%
gazillion miles an hour.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I came out at the
end of this tunnel-like

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:84%
environment, and I found
myself in the

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.455 align:middle line:90%
presence of this light.

00:16:47.455 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a point of light
existing in a field of

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:90%
relative darkness.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It was expansive light that
existed everywhere.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed to be brighter
and hotter in the direct

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.725 align:middle line:84%
center, although it
was everywhere.

00:17:02.725 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I could feel warmth, but not
warmth in the physical sense--

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:84%
just a warmth the way when you
feel warmly towards someone--

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.096 align:middle line:84%
that kind of warmth,
emotional warmth.

00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I could feel enormous
emotional warmth and

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:90%
incredible peace.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.133 align:middle line:84%
>>This life review is the
greatest teaching tool that

00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:84%
you will ever have to understand
the meaning of

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.896 align:middle line:84%
life, the purpose and the
direction that you're going in

00:17:33.896 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:90%
and what it's all about.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
After the panoramic life
review, the system

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:90%
of judgment is this.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
If the Holy Spirit could not
come today and it sent you, in

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the life you just reviewed, what
difference did it make?

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.715 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you see the
value of your spiritual

00:17:50.715 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:84%
identity, the great power and
greatness about yourself.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And then that passes.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.175 align:middle line:84%
And then you're back,
just you.

00:17:58.175 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't Dannion after that.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I was that divine spiritual,
playful being with dignity,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:90%
direction, and purpose.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>And then they showed
me the future.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
They showed me what I
came here to do--

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
that I came here to serve, to do
my little bit to be able to

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.120 align:middle line:84%
help humanity, to assist others,
to be compassionate,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:90%
to be caring.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if you leave now,
you will miss that great

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:90%
opportunity.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>And I said, who killed them?

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, the Nazis killed
them in camps.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.082 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, they
burned on the train.

00:18:30.082 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:90%
All of them?

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And then it struck me there
was something wrong.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.645 align:middle line:90%
I said, what are you?

00:18:38.645 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:90%
How can you know that?

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm a heavenly
social worker.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, a heavenly
social worker?

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:90%
They have that?

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.685 align:middle line:84%
I said, are those
guardian angels?

00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Sort of a lesser angel that
takes care of the humans.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, and you know me?

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
He said, for many,
many centuries.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, so how come they killed
all of the family?

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, they killed
all the Jews.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
You see, where I was in London,
we never heard about

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:90%
the Holocaust.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.336 align:middle line:90%
And we never anything.

00:19:19.336 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It was secret.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.992 align:middle line:84%
>>I was in the presence of
this extraordinary light.

00:19:25.992 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember feeling ashamed,
suddenly, and

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:90%
embarrassed.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, I was very clear in my
sense of things-- that the

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
shame and the embarrassment
was not coming

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:90%
from another place.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel judged.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
What I felt was how you might
feel if the Queen of England

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
came to your door unexpectedly
and the house was a mess, and

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:84%
you normally have it pretty
clean, but that moment wasn't

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:90%
one of those moments.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:90%
And in she came flouncing in.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And you just-- she had no
judgment about it, but she

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:84%
still is, after all, the
Queen of England.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And the house looks
like a mess.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>And so, I said, they
killed everybody?

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:90%
He said, pretty much.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:90%
I was so shocked.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I still see myself
sitting there.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going to spend
some time with you.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:90%
I spent three days with him.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>At night, I would go to
this hostel where they

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:90%
had a bed for me.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I went asking if I
could sleep over.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:90%
They said, yes.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I said his
name was John.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's your name?

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:90%
He said, John.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:90%
He was very pale.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
And he had very blue eyes.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so let me
ask you things.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:90%
He said, all right.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Are you Jewish, I said.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you Christian?

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, so what are you?

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we have a different
form of worship.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:90%
I said, is there a god?

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:90%
He said, it doesn't look like.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting in the
middle of it.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why does
he allow that?

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, men bring this
on themselves.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Everything is free choice.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, my people
wanted to die?

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he said, probably, because
this is how much karma

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:90%
got removed.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
That was, the people in the camp
had their karma removed.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.646 align:middle line:84%
It was like a bonus
or something.

00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:41.558 align:middle line:90%
Really?, I said.

00:21:41.558 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So you mean there is choice
about-- everything is choice.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:84%
What about the evil
ones like Hitler?

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Unfinished humans--

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:90%
that's what he said.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, what happens
when you die?

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:84%
You go to a place called
the bascal.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And there, you walk around and
learn what you've done and how

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
much you've learned and what
you need to learn.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And it is all looked at.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, is it scary?

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:90%
No, he said, it's not scary.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
What happens to real
evil ones?

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
He says, they just
have to grow.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Evil is only unknowing.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how will
they learn?

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.845 align:middle line:84%
They will learn by becoming
what they hated.

00:22:29.845 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, so Hitler will
become a Jew?

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Most likely, he said.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.510 align:middle line:84%
You can only learn after you
wear the sandals of another.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>I did find traditions in all
the great religions, Eastern

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and Western, of course,
for reincarnation.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And people had written
about it there.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism and Hinduism, of
course, it's never gone

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
In Judaism, belief in
reincarnation is an ancient

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:90%
and mainstream belief.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.600 align:middle line:90%
It's called gilgul hanefesh.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's part of the religion.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And in Christianity, of course,
reincarnation beliefs

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
were present for many centuries
after Jesus.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
The Romans didn't take
it out entirely

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:90%
until the sixth century.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So this was there in early
Christianity and throughout

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the history of Christianity,
also.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And even in Islam in the Sufi
tradition, belief in

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation is found
and is quite evident.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's there in all the
religious traditions.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat there in the
scientific traditions, but not

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:84%
really written about because
of these fears about being

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
considered weird or strange
or different.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And so it was kind of new.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, using it as
a therapy seemed new.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:84%
There were very few
people doing that.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So to take the ancient concepts
of reincarnation and

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:84%
past lives, and now, to make
it into a therapeutic

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:90%
modality, this was new.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Western science has just
arrived at the understanding

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:84%
that there is, in fact, a field
of intelligent energy

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that connects everything,
certainly in our world and,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
it's believed, beyond
our world,

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:90%
even the entire universe.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Our science has only now arrived
at the understanding,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
through the experiments and
through the studies and the

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
modeling of the equations,
to tell us, in

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:90%
fact, that field exists.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is the place
where we are now.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's the place where the
ancient, the indigenous

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:90%
traditions have always begun.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
They have always started from
the place that we are part of

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
everything, that we are a part
of a greater existence, that

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:90%
everything is connected.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And they have devoted their
time, rather than trying to

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:84%
explore and prove to themselves
this existence

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
really is there, they devoted
their times to understanding

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:84%
how to work within
this existence.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to
life and death?

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to our time
together in this world?

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>And that was the first
time I heard--

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say I
heard a thought.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a voice.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:90%
It was a voiceless voice.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:90%
But I did comprehend words.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And the thought energy that I
received was you are perfect

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:90%
just as you are.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.800 align:middle line:90%
And I am so pleased with you.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I heard something
astonishing.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
You must be told that you are
incapable of doing anything

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:90%
bad or wrong.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.462 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.462 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And my mind was working with
that data, like, well, that's

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.125 align:middle line:84%
not my experience
I experienced.

00:25:45.125 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I have done things
bad or wrong.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.545 align:middle line:84%
And the thought came back
instantly, this is a process

00:25:51.545 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
by which you simply become
grander than you were before.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:90%
You call this evolution.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:90%
It is a process.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.166 align:middle line:90%
It is simple.

00:26:01.166 --> 00:26:05.202 align:middle line:84%
And it is utterly acceptable
that no one has ever been

00:26:05.202 --> 00:26:09.075 align:middle line:84%
damaged by you, nor could
anyone ever be.

00:26:09.075 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a sense of absolution
in that moment.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>And I said to them,
I'm scared.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go back.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
don't have to.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:90%
You can stay with us.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you do, you would be
missing a great opportunity in

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
your life when you
came here to do.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many souls are
lining up to have a chance to

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:90%
have a little body like yours?

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:90%
It is such an opportunity.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I don't
want to go back.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>The panoramic life review is
the greatest gift, because

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
everybody has to understand
that it's bigger

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.772 align:middle line:90%
than we think it is.

00:26:51.772 --> 00:26:54.725 align:middle line:84%
It's more magnificent and more
beautiful than we could ever

00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:90%
dream it to be.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:84%
We have endless possibilities
to create.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
You will have this
life review.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
You will see your entire
life pass before you.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:84%
It will be a hologram
with depth and color

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and sound and visuals.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be so unique
and wondrous

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:90%
and sensual and elaborate.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty that there is a
system that records everything

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.765 align:middle line:84%
you've ever done for you to be
able to review it and learn

00:27:29.765 --> 00:27:31.015 align:middle line:90%
its lessons--

00:27:31.015 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:84%
when you see this life review,
you're not some scared,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
frightened little person
thinking you were born in sin.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You're a dignified, great, and
powerful mighty spiritual

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:49.200 align:middle line:84%
being with dignity, direction,
and purpose, looking at your

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:90%
life for what it was.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>The people approaching death,
particularly in some

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
kind of a sudden confrontation
with death, that they go

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
through a fairly stereotyped
sequence of experiences--

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
experiencing, for example, the
life review, passing through a

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:84%
tunnel, getting out of the
body, and perceiving

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.410 align:middle line:84%
accurately what's happening
around, or maybe even having

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
an astral projection into some
other areas, encountering a

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:84%
being of light, God, the divine
light, going through an

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
experience of either judging
themselves or being judged

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:40.530 align:middle line:84%
against some kind of universal
order approaching a certain

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:84%
frontier which they felt to be
a line of no return, and

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:84%
making the decision whether or
not they're gonna go back, and

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
feeling somehow the influences
of spouses and children and

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:01.320 align:middle line:84%
other relatives, or looking at
their work and feeling that

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.375 align:middle line:84%
certain significant parts
of their life are still

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:84%
unfinished, and then making
the decision to come back.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.505 align:middle line:84%
>>And what's going
to become of me?

00:29:09.505 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you will be a great
artist, painting the

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.764 align:middle line:90%
world that was no more.

00:29:15.764 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
You will marry your husband,
and you will be very

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:90%
compatible.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.750 align:middle line:90%
You will have four children.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And you will live
to be quite old,

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.985 align:middle line:90%
which I have done already.

00:29:31.985 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:90%
And you will be a painter.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And then what did he tell me?

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:90%
I was so full of questions.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him, do you--

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I was immediately jealous.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you have another
case you're working on?

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he said.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Another girl who lost her
legs during the bombing.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.200 align:middle line:90%
I see her in the evenings.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.486 align:middle line:84%
I said, where did you
see me before?

00:29:55.486 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, you were a dancer,
in Syria somewhere.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And I killed you.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, you killed me?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And then there were many other
times that you went.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said what happens when
you go over there?

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, then he told me
every little step

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:90%
by step what happens--

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the choices you make and
the places you go.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can go and be Christian
and sit in heaven or

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:84%
you can go and travel around in
the universe and you can go

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and just float around as a
spirit and sit on people's lap

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:84%
when you want to go
to the opera.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I remember him telling
me that.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And there are so many lovely--

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and then I said, when you get
real old and you've been very

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:90%
good, do you become an angel?

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, why not?

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, because it's a
different species--

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:90%
totally different.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I said, when they're born,
aren't there little angels?

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.660 align:middle line:84%
God thinks and you're
an angels.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes, God thinks
and you stop being.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So he said, you people
can live forever.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Angels is really not so good.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I was fascinated by it.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
he was so pale.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:90%
I wondered how he--

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.530 align:middle line:90%
now, I don't know.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.460 align:middle line:90%
He didn't tell me.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that he took the body of
an Air Force pilot and used

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:90%
it as a human--

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:84%
like a car, and that the spirit
of this angel was in

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:90%
that body, but not--

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.850 align:middle line:90%
it was just weird.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So because I went with him
to so many restaurants--

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
he ordered, but I never
saw him chew.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:84%
People have asked me when I've
told that story, did he chew?

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:90%
I never see him chew.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember that
mouth chewing.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>And he said, this is what
you came here to do.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:90%
This is your mission.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I could understand it with
the mind of the six-year-old

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and the mind of someone who
was 3,000 years old.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that if I chose
to stay, then my task

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.900 align:middle line:84%
would be to be of service, to be
of healing, to try to make

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.155 align:middle line:84%
a difference in what small way
I could in this world to

00:32:05.155 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%
alleviate suffering.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.140 align:middle line:90%
But I was scared.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And just as I was making that
choice and these luminous

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:84%
beings were holding
me, suddenly, my

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:90%
physical heart stopped.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And it drew me back
into my body.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I was suddenly snapped back
into my physical body.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the pain,
wracked with pain.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:90%
My heart started again.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel the heat.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I could feel the pain.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I could feel myself quivering.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:90%
I could feel myself in spasms.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And I screamed.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:90%
I cried.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And the following morning,
I woke up, and

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:90%
the fever had broken.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>As I began to wonder about
life and all that such a

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:84%
circumstance would bring up in
an inquiring mind, I suddenly

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.185 align:middle line:84%
found myself in a different
environment.

00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
In front of me were a million
kajillion kazillion individual

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:90%
particles of light.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:84%
They were particles of matter,
I want to say, like energy.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:84%
They looked like
little amoeba.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:18.855 align:middle line:84%
They were pulsating and, in a
sense, blinking on and off.

00:33:18.855 --> 00:33:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
interconnected--

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:84%
a mosaic of interconnected
units of energy.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:46.787 align:middle line:84%
And as these interconnected
units of energy blinked on and

00:33:46.787 --> 00:33:49.490 align:middle line:90%
off, they changed shape.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And as they changed shape,
they changed color.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.295 align:middle line:84%
And as they changed shape, the
unit next to it changed shape,

00:34:02.295 --> 00:34:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and next to that and next to
that, so that what we had was

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:12.929 align:middle line:84%
a vibrating pulsating overall
mass created by these

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:16.600 align:middle line:84%
individual particles that never
lost connection with

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
itself, but at the same
moment, maintained the

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
individuality of each
individual,

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:90%
each separate element.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's something
remarkable about this, because

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I saw, when I looked at this
incredible jewelry of the

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:84%
universe, the greenest
greens, the reddest

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.225 align:middle line:90%
reds, the bluest blues.

00:34:46.225 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand the
miracle here, because I happen

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.285 align:middle line:90%
to be color blind.

00:34:53.285 --> 00:34:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>The second time I died was
in the Amazon, in ceremony

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:05.030 align:middle line:84%
working with the shamans and
with the medicine plants.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.350 align:middle line:84%
During ceremony, I was in
a very altered state of

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was lying by the river.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I smelled the
stench of putrefaction, of

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:90%
something that was spoiling.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down at my arm,
and my arm was rotting.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And I could sense the
putrefaction.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the bone and I
could see the worms and the

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.170 align:middle line:84%
critters that were chewing
at my body.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel the pain.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And the stench was the most
overwhelming odor.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It was revolting, nauseating.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked at my
left arm, and my left

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:90%
arm was still intact.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But then it began from
my hands, began to

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.740 align:middle line:90%
make its way up.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked down at my
chest and I could see my ribs

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:90%
in my ribcage.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to scream and
I couldn't scream.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And the stench was nauseating.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And then this grey bird appeared
next to me, and it

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:90%
pecked out my eyes.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.720 align:middle line:90%
It sunk its beak into my eyes.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And lifted off my face.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It lifted off my face and it
made off with it, and it

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.140 align:middle line:90%
dropped it into the river.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Like you lift milk, cream from
a cup of coffee, it lifted it

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:84%
right up and dropped
it in the river.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was screaming because
I had lost my face.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:90%
And then I lost consciousness.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back to my body,
it was whole, perhaps

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.420 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
in many years.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the death
that I had experienced was the

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.020 align:middle line:84%
symbolic death of initiation
of the shamans, that it was

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:84%
the death of my social self, of
all of the expectations, of

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:84%
all of the social contracts, of
all of the promises that I

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.790 align:middle line:84%
had made to my mother, to my
father, to myself, to the

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:84%
priest that educated me about
who I should be and what I

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:90%
should become.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It was the death of
a social being.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And the loss of my faith was the
loss of a persona, of an

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:07.800 align:middle line:84%
ego, of a face that really
did not belong to me.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:84%
After that, when I looked at
myself in the mirror, I saw

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:16.500 align:middle line:84%
myself and not this face that
I had carefully sculpted to

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:24.550 align:middle line:84%
represent the success and the
depth and the elegance and the

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.180 align:middle line:84%
suavity that I thought
was important to

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:90%
get by in this life.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.980 align:middle line:84%
That face needed to die in
order for me to discover

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.080 align:middle line:90%
who I really am.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>My first 25 years, I can
tell you for sure.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through all the
pain and anguish and

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:84%
aggravation and brutality that
I created on everyone else.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:90%
I was a tough guy.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm six foot four and I weigh
250 pounds, and I will knock

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.012 align:middle line:90%
the thunder out of you.

00:37:55.012 --> 00:37:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I dealt
with everything.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But after I got tired of hitting
myself in the face,

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.210 align:middle line:84%
after having life reviews,
you tend to wise up.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I want people to learn
from this is don't be

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:84%
afraid that it's coming,
because it's coming.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It's what you do today because
I gave you this information

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that makes you have something to
look forward to instead of

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:84%
something to fear,
because I've been

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:90%
through three of them.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched the difference
between the three

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to see that I'm growing
and I'm better.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's not out of fear.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not out of being
frightened.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.430 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's what you're
supposed to do.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want a great spiritual
life equal to I want to enjoy

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:84%
the physical and mental life
that gives value to emotion,

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and to celebrate every day I'm
here, and to build the best

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:84%
panoramic life review
I can possibly have.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a certain form of
reckoning and review and so

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.970 align:middle line:84%
on, although it can take
different forms.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.730 align:middle line:84%
In some people, it comes
in the form of certain

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:84%
highlights, but more like
a mosaic of highlights.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.130 align:middle line:84%
For some other people, it's more
like a continuous film.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it goes backward from
the dangerous situation

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.370 align:middle line:90%
where death is imminent.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:16.470 align:middle line:84%
It starts rolling back
like a film playing

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.130 align:middle line:90%
back towards the birth.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it takes people to
birth and is actual replay.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>At the last day that I spent
with the angel, which was in

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Hyde Park, and we were
sitting on the bench.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me, and he
said, stop talking, Renate.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Then he looked at me and his
eyes suddenly blazed.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.320 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:90%
And he said, fine.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I've done my job,
or something.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:90%
He said, I must leave now.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything's taken care of.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Your next thing you do, you'll
go to Baker Street, and you go

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and you sign up for the Third
Army as an interpreter.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And you will find your
way back this way

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:90%
And goodbye.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:90%
I said, don't go, John.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Stay a little longer.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:90%
No, he says, I must go now.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, if you need me, if
you really, truly need me,

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:90%
this is a sign you make.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:84%
You make a triangle this
size within a circle.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.080 align:middle line:90%
And you call John.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'll come.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But don't do it unless
you really need me.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I did it hundreds of times
when I didn't need him

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happened.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.670 align:middle line:90%
He was gone.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Baker Street.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And I went and I saw they were
just moving in a desk up there

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.130 align:middle line:90%
on Baker Street.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big sign
saying office for

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:90%
the Third Army, USA.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I walked right
behind the desk.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can you can
use some new people?

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what
can you do?

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, I speak German
and English.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we can use interpreters.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I got in as an
interpreter for the invasion.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>When the ancients talked about
heaven and their hands

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:84%
always went like this,
were those heavens?

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are multiple
heavens.

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Were those heavens the
higher dimensions?

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Was heaven the language they
used 5,000 years ago for what

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
our male-dominated,
schematically-oriented,

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
left-brained technological
society calls higher

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:90%
dimensional state spaces?

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about
the same thing?

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is the value of
going back into these ancient

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
traditions and looking at the
way they look at the world

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:84%
through their eyes, and asking,
what did they know,

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:90%
maybe, that we've forgotten?

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Shamans understand that
we have a few limited

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:56.490 align:middle line:84%
opportunities to experience
infinity and to individuate as

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.080 align:middle line:90%
luminous beings.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We only have six, seven, eight,
nine lives to do it in.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation and eternity
is not a given.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not a guarantee.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a possibility for those
who have the courage, the

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:16.120 align:middle line:84%
integrity, and the discipline to
retain their individuality

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.850 align:middle line:90%
beyond death.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:18.990 align:middle line:90%
What religion did is suddenly

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:90%
popularized this for everybody.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.590 align:middle line:84%
They said, yes, this is
everybody's birthright.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It is our birthright, but
it is not a given.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:84%
If you do not take that act of
power, of courage to step into

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.830 align:middle line:84%
your destiny as an infinite
being, you're going to be

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:84%
returned to the great
mulch or the great

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.810 align:middle line:90%
life force of creation.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Your molecules will dissolve.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.820 align:middle line:84%
It's only the man and woman of
wisdom that is able to make

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that leap into infinity
and remember who

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.890 align:middle line:90%
they have always been.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And they will never be touched
by death again.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>But once you know that you
never really die, because

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
you're never really
born, it really

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:90%
changes the fear of death.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Once you know that you're going
to be reunited with your

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.060 align:middle line:84%
loved ones, either on the other
side or back here again

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.120 align:middle line:84%
in physical form, it has
a lot to do with

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.610 align:middle line:90%
alleviating these fears.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.980 align:middle line:90%
You know that it doesn't stop.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course, they're removed
from us physically.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.890 align:middle line:90%
The bodies die.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.640 align:middle line:84%
But the consciousness,
the soul, the

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.140 align:middle line:90%
spirit, this goes on.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
essence of us.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the important of us, not
so much the physical body.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So at a crude level, it's like
having a car and you're the

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.550 align:middle line:90%
driver of the car.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But you start believing
that you're the car.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:38.980 align:middle line:90%
You're not.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:90%
The car wears out.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.580 align:middle line:90%
You get out.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:84%
You get another car-- maybe a
different model, different

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.340 align:middle line:90%
make, different color.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.155 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we are.

00:43:48.155 --> 00:43:49.275 align:middle line:90%
We change race.

00:43:49.275 --> 00:43:50.545 align:middle line:90%
We change religion.

00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:51.425 align:middle line:90%
We change sex.

00:43:51.425 --> 00:43:53.420 align:middle line:84%
We change nationality
because we have to

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.770 align:middle line:90%
learn from all sides.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>So I saw these colors.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And I knew what they were.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:84%
No one had to say, well, I know
you've never seen this,

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.550 align:middle line:90%
but this is called green.

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I just knew.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.540 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
oh, my.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.590 align:middle line:84%
This is what people
see on the earth.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.400 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get closer to it.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I felt a yearning, a deep
yearning, to move closer to

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:36.860 align:middle line:84%
this field of pulsating,
vibrating, unspeakably

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.673 align:middle line:90%
beautiful energy.

00:44:38.673 --> 00:44:44.215 align:middle line:90%


00:44:44.215 --> 00:44:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But as I moved toward it, as I
tried to propel myself or move

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.075 align:middle line:90%
toward it, it moved away.

00:44:50.075 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I recall thinking, gosh,
it was over here, too.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked over there,
it was over there.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that it
was all around me.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.662 align:middle line:84%
And as I realized it was all
around me, I thought, well,

00:45:11.662 --> 00:45:14.740 align:middle line:90%
maybe I'll sneak up on it.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't maneuver
faster than it.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what I did, I
couldn't get closer to it.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I had a deep desire to move
closer to it, to become

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:90%
one with it, actually.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:32.980 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>And a guardian is not some
great powerful thing, like an

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:90%
archangel or any of that.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual being from your
particular form or group

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that has unfinished business,
but also has a right to help

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.070 align:middle line:90%
guide and support you.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it fulfills them, like a
parent does helping a child,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and that sense of appreciation
that comes in return.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So there are differences in the
near death experience and

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.420 align:middle line:84%
the true structure
of spirituality.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.220 align:middle line:84%
For me, I've been through
this thing three times.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm normal, kind of.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.720 align:middle line:90%
But I live an everyday life.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't contemplate my
navel, and I'm not

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.150 align:middle line:90%
a big woo-woo person.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But I know about death,
spirituality, multiple levels

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.750 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and those
identities because I have

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:90%
experienced them being dead.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot not see world
through those levels.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Like if I watch you--

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and I can look at you and I can
see depth and movement and

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:38.650 align:middle line:84%
energy between you and I. I can
see colors around you, and

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I can sense other levels of
consciousness that are

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:44.220 align:middle line:84%
interacting in your life
spiritually and

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.370 align:middle line:90%
mentally right now.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have any
choice about that.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I decided to do with
that is be at the bedside,

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.300 align:middle line:84%
because if I can be at the
bedside, I can help that

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.730 align:middle line:84%
person have closure with that
family and I can help them

00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:90%
pass safely.

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can leave a sense with
that family that they did

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.160 align:middle line:90%
everything they could do.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And because I can perceive and
be aware these levels of

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.486 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, I am empathic.

00:47:08.486 --> 00:47:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And why I become empathic is
so that I can help them.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It's intent that helps
a spiritual

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.560 align:middle line:90%
being develop its potential.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not what you do,
it's why you do it.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's the greatest lesson
of the panoramic

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.380 align:middle line:90%
life review, too.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to why you're
doing it and don't lie to

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.790 align:middle line:84%
yourself because it's all going
to come back and you're

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:90%
all going to get to see it.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:90%
And you can't fool you.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>So what happens?

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.080 align:middle line:90%
We die.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:90%
We leave our bodies.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.110 align:middle line:90%
We float up.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, there's a stage
of renewal that

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.230 align:middle line:90%
happens rather quickly.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:43.040 align:middle line:84%
That means that there's this
light and this energy and

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.120 align:middle line:84%
these others around us,
then, as we have left

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.830 align:middle line:90%
the physical body.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.910 align:middle line:84%
The people or spirits around
us can be relatives, can be

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.750 align:middle line:84%
parents, grandparents, people
who have already gone to the

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.830 align:middle line:84%
other side, and greet
us there--

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:57.580 align:middle line:90%
a kind of reunion.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be spiritual figures
from your tradition to make

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:06.540 align:middle line:84%
this transition to the other
side easier, more comfortable.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the renewal is from
this light, the spirit just

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.080 align:middle line:90%
gets refreshed, renewed.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, there's a
stage of decision.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:20.200 align:middle line:84%
That's when you come back,
how are you coming back?

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Which parents are
you choosing?

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Which lessons are you
choosing to work on?

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:28.290 align:middle line:84%
What is your spiritual plan
for the coming lifetime?

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So each phase, each step, each
level has a purpose.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:90%
We didn't cover all seven.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But these are kind of steps in
the preparation for returning

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, for not
returning, because, of course,

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:46.430 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to not have to
reincarnate anymore, to have

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.900 align:middle line:90%
mastered the lessons.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>A few years go by,
and I'm almost 40.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm 41.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And I paint landscapes and
we have a gallery.

00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a gallery in Palo Alto,
California Avenue.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And in my lovely little gallery,
I have a woman that

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.080 align:middle line:84%
comes every day and won't
say anything.

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.430 align:middle line:84%
She sits on the chair
and sits there.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I said, what's
your name?

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.840 align:middle line:90%
And she said, Dixie.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.590 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dixie?

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:16.920 align:middle line:84%
She had a great big sign
on her forehead.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:90%
She never talked.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, the master said that
you have to close the gallery.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:33.090 align:middle line:90%
The master said, you promised.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I promised?

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.400 align:middle line:84%
She says, the master
said, you can't--

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.630 align:middle line:84%
no, you will not sell
another thing.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So the rent came due and I
didn't have enough money.

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the next month, the
rent came due, so we closed

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:47.740 align:middle line:90%
the gallery.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And I went home.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And she called on the phone.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.170 align:middle line:90%
She said, can I come--

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.920 align:middle line:90%
she lived in San Jose--

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and tell you the story why you
had to close the gallery?

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.350 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>And again, this voice came to
me, the voiceless voice of

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.600 align:middle line:90%
my own thoughts.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And it said, you could no sooner
get closer to that than

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:84%
you could move your eyes
closer to your nose.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.485 align:middle line:84%
As you move, it moves for the
very simple fact that you and

00:50:17.485 --> 00:50:21.240 align:middle line:84%
it are one and there's
no disconnection.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:26.130 align:middle line:84%
That is you, and so of course
it moves with you.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You are already where you
are trying to be--

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:31.790 align:middle line:90%
submerged in the oneness.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Simply experience it.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.820 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had the quite
natural thought, gee, I wonder

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:54.890 align:middle line:84%
if I look as beautiful to
it as it does to me?

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:59.274 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I already knew
the answer intuitively.

00:50:59.274 --> 00:51:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And the awareness of my own
beauty was not felt by me as

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.010 align:middle line:84%
on earth when someone told me
something nice about myself--

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:11.380 align:middle line:90%
a little feeling of pride.

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It was just a feeling
of yes, of course.

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:19.295 align:middle line:90%
It's all that beautiful.

00:51:19.295 --> 00:51:24.450 align:middle line:84%
How could I have ever seen
ugliness anywhere, in anyone,

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:28.910 align:middle line:84%
in anything, least
of all in me?

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Let me describe Dixie.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:40.640 align:middle line:84%
She looked like a milk
maid from Kansas.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.220 align:middle line:90%
She was a big woman.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.350 align:middle line:84%
She had a big brown
spot right there.

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:47.550 align:middle line:84%
She looked as ordinary
as possible.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And she wouldn't tell me who
she was and what she did.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So she said, the master
said I'm supposed to

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.380 align:middle line:90%
tell you the story.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.810 align:middle line:90%
So I said, what story?

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.980 align:middle line:84%
The story is, she said,
Renate, that

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.240 align:middle line:90%
you have lived before.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You lived as a daughter of a
mother that ran a vegetable

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:84%
stand in a market in one of
those little villages outside

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Poland, called the pale.

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I was?

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the table, she used
to sprinkle water onto her

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:27.060 align:middle line:84%
vegetable, which were on a big
wooden table with cracks.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And the water went down
onto the ground and

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:30.550 align:middle line:90%
made the ground wet.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And there I sat with a stick.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I drew everybody
that walked by.

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.890 align:middle line:90%
I made pictures of them all.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And she says, don't do that.

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:42.530 align:middle line:90%
It's forbidden.

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not allowed for you to
make pictures of humans

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.390 align:middle line:84%
because man is made in
the image of God.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:52.880 align:middle line:90%
You must not draw people.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:90%
I drew people all the time.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And she used to wipe it
out with her foot.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is what went on.

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.850 align:middle line:90%
And then the Cossacks came.

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And they burned our little
village down, including my

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.380 align:middle line:84%
mother and the little house
we lived in and myself.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So I burned up, together with my
mother and everybody else.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>So we know that our soul, what
we call our soul, is an

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.370 align:middle line:90%
energetic essence.

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.500 align:middle line:84%
A number of studies were done
early in the 20th century even

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to measure, at the
instant of death, how much

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:36.080 align:middle line:84%
weight a body loses
in their passing.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And no matter if the person
was a 300-pound man or a

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.650 align:middle line:84%
70-pound woman, the amount of
weight that they lost--

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 28 grams, I
believe is what it was, was

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:46.035 align:middle line:90%
the average.

00:53:46.035 --> 00:53:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>The problem with linear time,
with the kind of time

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that flies like an arrow, is
that it's ruled by causality,

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.440 align:middle line:90%
by cause and effect--

00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.430 align:middle line:84%
it's that who we are today was
predetermined by the karma

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that we lived, by what happened
to us when we were

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:07.140 align:middle line:84%
six, when we were 12, by the
genes that we inherited.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Non-linear time, the other kind
of time that turns like a

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:17.150 align:middle line:84%
wheel, is informed not only by
the past, but by the future.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:20.190 align:middle line:84%
The main operating principle
is synchronicity.

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:23.880 align:middle line:84%
We can be informed by
who we are becoming

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.520 align:middle line:90%
10,000 years from today.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.000 align:middle line:84%
We can be informed by that self
that is timeless, that is

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.240 align:middle line:84%
infinite, and that is not
subject to death.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the task of
the shamans--

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to break free of that linear
time, to be informed by who

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:39.960 align:middle line:90%
they're becoming.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, they have to
break free of death and break

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:47.730 align:middle line:84%
free of fear, which is what
keeps us bound to time and to

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:50.320 align:middle line:90%
being stalked by death.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>After I died, I went to a
place called the astrologist,

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.690 align:middle line:84%
where people go to see how
much they've done.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I complained that I was
given the talent and not

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:05.850 align:middle line:90%
allowed to use it.

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was a tribunal of
three men that called me.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.475 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting there.

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:14.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what she told me.

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you have
to give us a promise if we

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.250 align:middle line:90%
send you back--

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that you will paint the world
you saw then because this is

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.400 align:middle line:84%
very important that
it gets painted.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.810 align:middle line:90%
You have the talent.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.350 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And we will give
you the memory.

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Reincarnation is nothing but
this continue that we were

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.320 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.730 align:middle line:84%
This continuity is called
reincarnation.

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:47.872 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.872 --> 00:55:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Past moments continuing in this
moment, which continues

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.460 align:middle line:90%
on to the next moment--

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.600 align:middle line:84%
this is what we call
reincarnation process.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:03.605 align:middle line:84%
But this is also called birth,
death, birth, and death, and

00:56:03.605 --> 00:56:05.100 align:middle line:90%
birth process.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Every moment, there's a
birth of that moment.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a seeming continuity
of that moment.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And then there's end
of that moment.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.517 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a beginning of
the next moment, which is a

00:56:16.517 --> 00:56:20.624 align:middle line:84%
continuity of that moment
which has ceased.

00:56:20.624 --> 00:56:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And then that continuity is what
we call reincarnation.

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>And rebirth just is an
automatic process by an

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:34.150 align:middle line:84%
unenlightened person driven by
their subconscious impulses,

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.640 align:middle line:84%
seeking what they think is a
safe place or an attractive

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.740 align:middle line:84%
place driven by fear
or hatred or lust.

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And we just call that rebirth
because it's sort of a

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:43.850 align:middle line:90%
mechanical process.

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is kind of mechanical and
aimless because people are

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.230 align:middle line:84%
not conscious of what
they're doing.

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation, we like to
reserve for when someone has

00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:54.360 align:middle line:84%
reached a point where they
understand their inner

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:58.010 align:middle line:84%
impulses and they have some
measure of freedom from them.

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.000 align:middle line:84%
When they're Buddha, they are
completely free for them.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But when they're at different
stages, they're

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:03.080 align:middle line:90%
somewhat free from them.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they don't have
to be reborn this or that way,

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:09.250 align:middle line:84%
but they choose to out of an
altruistic loving motive.

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we reserve
reincarnation for.

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, reincarnation
is when--

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.070 align:middle line:84%
when you're capable of
reincarnation, as opposed to

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:84%
mechanical rebirth, is when
you have become conscious

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:23.680 align:middle line:84%
about your evolution and you're
using karma or action

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.730 align:middle line:90%
or evolutionary action--

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:29.540 align:middle line:84%
you're using it consciously to
reshape your life into a

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.070 align:middle line:90%
better and better mode.

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>Someone may be regressed
hypnotically to see why are

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:39.070 align:middle line:90%
they having a difficult

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:41.430 align:middle line:90%
relationship with their sister?

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a past life, that
sister might have been their

00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:47.710 align:middle line:84%
mother, and they didn't have a
good relationship, so it's

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:middle line:90%
still being carried over.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So we come down to play
different roles.

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:50.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Let me try being your sister
this time and see if we can

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.730 align:middle line:84%
work it out on a
sister level as

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:55.980 align:middle line:90%
opposed to a mother daughter.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.660 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that we know
what we're doing

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:00.480 align:middle line:90%
before we come here.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>So how can we all be the same
if we're so different?

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.850 align:middle line:84%
During meditation or during a
dream-- because to me, there's

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:10.050 align:middle line:90%
a great overlap there.

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll often dream of
these images.

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And to me, dreaming is a form
of meditation, too.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:18.816 align:middle line:84%
You just have to know how to
read the signs, how to

00:58:18.816 --> 00:58:21.580 align:middle line:84%
interpret the images
that come up.

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:25.685 align:middle line:84%
But I saw this diamond in
everybody's chest--

00:58:25.685 --> 00:58:28.760 align:middle line:84%
beautiful diamond,
1,000 facets.

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's diamond
is the same.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But some of the diamonds are
covered with dirt or tar.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And the job of the soul seems
to be to clean the

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.720 align:middle line:90%
facets, each one.

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.860 align:middle line:84%
When all 1,000 are cleaned, the
pressure seems to dissolve

00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:53.165 align:middle line:84%
and the diamonds just radiate
light and disperse into the

00:58:53.165 --> 00:58:54.985 align:middle line:84%
universe or whatever you
want to call it.

00:58:54.985 --> 00:58:58.050 align:middle line:84%
The diamonds are completely
pure.

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So some people have polished a
lot of the facets, maybe 900

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.895 align:middle line:90%
or 999, and others only a few.

00:59:04.895 --> 00:59:07.320 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of work to do.

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And so then, I understood.

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's diamond
is the same--

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.160 align:middle line:84%
1,000 facets and the potential
is exactly the same.

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is on
the same journey.

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But some have cleaned only a
little bit, and others have

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:19.330 align:middle line:90%
cleaned a lot.

00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's really just a matter of
degree, not of difference.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Immediately, when I came to
that awareness, I was, again,

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:32.200 align:middle line:84%
shifted and changed into
yet another location.

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.490 align:middle line:84%
There I was, in front of a huge
book, which I understood

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to be the book of knowledge, the
Akashic records, the book

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.535 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom, whatever you
want to call it.

00:59:45.535 --> 00:59:46.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge book.

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking at
this enormous book.

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I recall as I opened the
book or-- see, I had no hands.

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But I would just think of a hand
opening the book, and an

00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:59.970 align:middle line:84%
invisible hand opened
the book.

00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And on one page, the type was so
tiny, that I realized that

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
there's probably all the data
in all the encyclopedias of

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.350 align:middle line:90%
the world on that single page.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:15.176 align:middle line:84%
And the book must have had five
billion pages like that.

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, what
am I looking at?

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And my friend the voice came
back again and said, you've

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.635 align:middle line:90%
really wanted to know.

01:00:22.635 --> 01:00:25.170 align:middle line:84%
You've yearned to know
for so long.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And your yearning
has been pure.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't for ego reasons or to
make yourself better than.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Your soul simply yearned to
know, and we see that you have

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:37.620 align:middle line:90%
just wanted to know.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
You've yearned so long
here already.

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Here.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:44.025 align:middle line:84%
Here's the answer
to everything.

01:00:44.025 --> 01:00:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And with that, it was as if
somebody went, [EXHALE], and

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:52.982 align:middle line:84%
the pages, from the gentlest
breeze just went, [EXHALE],

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
from first page to last
of this enormous book.

01:00:56.330 --> 01:01:01.856 align:middle line:84%
And as each page passed, I
absorbed every piece of data

01:01:01.856 --> 01:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
on every page until the book
closed just that fast.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.040 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, I knew.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I knew all
there was to know about

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.550 align:middle line:90%
everything.

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>People ought to listen to what
I'm telling them, because

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, the fear of
what comes next is gone, and

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
the joy of looking forward to it
begins to empower, dignify,

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and glorify your life.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.902 align:middle line:84%
We are great, powerful,
and mighty,

01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:31.190 align:middle line:90%
playful spiritual beings.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.050 align:middle line:90%
We have dignity.

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:32.630 align:middle line:90%
We have direction.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:33.950 align:middle line:90%
And we have purpose.

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
We have always had that.

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
We have it now.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.905 align:middle line:84%
And we will always have
it after this.

01:01:38.905 --> 01:01:41.955 align:middle line:84%
And the only problem people have
is that they're getting

01:01:41.955 --> 01:01:43.500 align:middle line:90%
in their own way.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
They're letting a whole bunch of
other stuff not give value

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to their love and determine the
value of their love based

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.535 align:middle line:84%
on what somebody else's
rules are.

01:01:52.535 --> 01:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what confuses
a spiritual being.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.392 align:middle line:84%
And then the fear of
sin and death--

01:01:58.392 --> 01:02:00.690 align:middle line:90%
what garbage.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:01.860 align:middle line:90%
It's garbage.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
When you have your panoramic
life review, you will feel

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
every pain, but you
also feel the joy.

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And mot people don't
realize that, in

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:13.840 align:middle line:90%
their life, true goodness--

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
when you said hello, when you
patted somebody on the back,

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
when you said it's
going to be OK--

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
think about when your life
review, and that's you, that

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.260 align:middle line:90%
one simple moment.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So in all these life reviews
that I've had, I've watched me

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
grow, because the first one was
really tough because I was

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.350 align:middle line:90%
an asshole.

01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm still basically that, but
I'm not causing as much

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:36.780 align:middle line:90%
trouble as I did.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>People believe that
the spirit world

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:41.700 align:middle line:90%
is part of our world.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
We are and always will
be part of theirs.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the real world.

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:46.620 align:middle line:90%
That is the real world.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
This is just a small little
segment of it, OK?

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So remember, they are not
part of our world.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We are part of their world
and always will be.

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>The next day-- and it was
the next day after Dixie--

01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I was standing at that
dining room table

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
again with a pencil.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I began to draw a
village with--

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I remember the storks on the
roof with the chimneys and the

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:10.310 align:middle line:90%
people walking.

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And it just developed.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.830 align:middle line:90%
I just knew how to do it.

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:18.726 align:middle line:84%
After that, I did
three years--

01:03:18.726 --> 01:03:21.970 align:middle line:90%
three years of those.

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:24.980 align:middle line:90%
I painted that one town.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I painted the town breaking up
with the peddlers, the town

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
having festivals, the town,
children in the town, dancing,

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
the weddings, the snow
coming, everything.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.465 align:middle line:90%
There were 39 paintings.

01:03:38.465 --> 01:03:40.400 align:middle line:84%
First, I did them
in water color.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I did them
in the oil.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were called "The Lost
World of the Shtetl." And then

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:48.445 align:middle line:90%
I got a call from Dixie again.

01:03:48.445 --> 01:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the master said,
don't sell any of those.

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:56.160 align:middle line:90%
They have to be kept together.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.660 align:middle line:90%
And it will be taken care of.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.226 align:middle line:90%
It will be acknowledged.

01:04:01.226 --> 01:04:02.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, really?

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
The last one, the town burns.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I painted that, too, and the
few, the remnant that run away

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and stuff-- everything.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of people say,
who's my soul mate?

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we all have many
soul mates-- your parent,

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
your child, your friend
can be a soul mate.

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:20.540 align:middle line:90%
People get confused.

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I think we have many
soul mates.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Soul groups are-- it goes
with reincarnation.

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we come
down in soul groups.

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:28.930 align:middle line:90%
So your family, your friends--

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
you've done this before, but
with different roles.

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Many kids act like the parent.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were in
another life.

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Your friend, who you have a
kinship with that you don't

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
know why-- you just
met this person.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe there was
another role.

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were your daughter,
your mother.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So we all come down,
I believe--

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:48.540 align:middle line:84%
my theory-- in soul groups, but
play different roles to

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.350 align:middle line:90%
learn off each other.

01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a difference between
infinity and eternity.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Eternity is the stuff
of Western religion.

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Eternity is an infinite
number of moments.

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Infinity is before time and
after time, prior to time,

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.700 align:middle line:90%
unbound to time.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.580 align:middle line:90%
It is boundless.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It is a place where you can have
the future and the past

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
occurring concurrently,
simultaneously, where time

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:24.515 align:middle line:84%
doesn't flow in one direction
like it does for us, but it

01:05:24.515 --> 01:05:28.770 align:middle line:84%
loops and pretzels and
figure-eights and wormholes,

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
where you can have multiple
time frames occurring

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:33.460 align:middle line:90%
concurrently.

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.370 align:middle line:90%


01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>And I remember thinking, how
simple, how elegantly,

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
unbelievably simple it all is,
the whole system, life,

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.230 align:middle line:90%
everything.

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:57.920 align:middle line:90%


01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat there, if you
please, in my non-body.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
just contemplating the beauty of
the utter simplicity of it.

01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, I was suddenly
back in my body.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Somebody says, Dannion,
why does bad things

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
happen to good people?

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.140 align:middle line:90%
My answer--

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but I know why
bad things happen to bad

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.880 align:middle line:84%
people, because I'm
the authority on

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.230 align:middle line:90%
how that system works.

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:32.180 align:middle line:90%
So here's the meaning of life.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.270 align:middle line:84%
You are chosen to come
to this world.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll take on any place, anybody,
anywhere about

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.575 align:middle line:84%
whether this is absolute
truth, any time.

01:06:40.575 --> 01:06:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Come get you some.

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
You were chosen to come here
because the divine architects

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
believe that there is no one at
a certain specific time and

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
point in the evolution of
consciousness, from a divine

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
spiritual world threw you into
a mental and physical world--

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
this little rock in the middle
of a solar system.

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
To manifest spirituality on
the earth, you must pass

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
through this person that is you
and the structured bodies

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in order
for it to manifest.

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:10.555 align:middle line:84%
The divine architect says
there's nobody better than

01:07:10.555 --> 01:07:13.950 align:middle line:90%
you, end of story.

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And how do you know?

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The odds of anyone being
identical to you on the earth

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is 1 in 16 billion, 300
or 400 million.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's only 6 billion
people here, so guess what?

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:23.880 align:middle line:90%
You're the one.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So shut up and get over it
and just keep being you.

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Number two, you chose to come
here, because as you hit a

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
certain point in evolution, by
being able to come into a

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
physical existence, you can
slow down all the laws and

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
manifest in a slow, muddled
way by feeling

01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:51.895 align:middle line:90%
your way in the darkness.

01:07:51.895 --> 01:07:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So a spiritual being evolves the
sensitivity necessary to

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
watch manifestation,
co-creators, god-like, moving

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
in the image--

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that we can see ourselves in
this form of manifestation,

01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:12.695 align:middle line:84%
and to learn compassion
and kindness.

01:08:12.695 --> 01:08:17.819 align:middle line:90%


01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>And then, after that
came the visions--

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:24.350 align:middle line:90%
clearly, every day.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.279 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought it
was very strange.

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Then came the people that
had to see this--

01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
the rabbis, the psychiatrists,
the people that entered my

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.540 align:middle line:84%
house just said, she's
perfectly normal.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.174 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with her.

01:08:37.174 --> 01:08:38.790 align:middle line:90%
She's just different.

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:40.790 align:middle line:90%
And then they came.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Then we went on a
little vacation.

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:44.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm now 44.

01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:50.439 align:middle line:84%
And as we drove back onto the
driveway right there, we could

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
hear the phone ringing
in the house.

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:53.979 align:middle line:90%
And Jerry gave me the keys.

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, run in and
get the phone.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I opened the door and I
ran in, crashed into the

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%
house, got the phone.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Berkeley
Museum to start with.

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had very few museums
that called me, trust me.

01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:07.990 align:middle line:90%
But that it was.

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Mrs. Dollinger,
we heard that you have a group

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:14.640 align:middle line:90%
of Eastern European paintings.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We would like to send
somebody to look it.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.200 align:middle line:90%
So they send the curator.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And he came across the bay to
Palo Alto and looked at them.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.116 align:middle line:84%
And I got a show there
in Berkeley

01:09:30.116 --> 01:09:32.420 align:middle line:90%
that lasted two months.

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:36.609 align:middle line:84%
And then my group of "The Lost
World of the Shtetls" never

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:37.270 align:middle line:90%
came home anymore.

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:39.340 align:middle line:90%
They went to San Francisco.

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
They went to the Skirball
Museum.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.859 align:middle line:90%
They went to--

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:46.310 align:middle line:84%
there were so many museums,
I can't remember them all.

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And then they went to the SSA.

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:51.890 align:middle line:84%
They went from one
place to another.

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.850 align:middle line:90%
They were a traveling show.

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it was over and
I got those back.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
And Dixie reappeared.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
She called, and then I
talked to her a lot.

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the master says
you can paint all the shtetls

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:08.330 align:middle line:84%
you want and sell them now, but
not those-- not those 39.

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They have to be kept
in the family.

01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've kept them
in the family.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:16.560 align:middle line:90%


01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Knowing what I know now, I
could never be afraid of

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.590 align:middle line:90%
death, not even a little bit.

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wonderful benefit
to that, of course,

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
because when you're no longer
afraid of dying, you're no

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.296 align:middle line:90%
longer afraid of living.

01:10:32.296 --> 01:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes every moment
so rich and so deep and so

01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:42.540 align:middle line:90%
extraordinarily exciting--

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
even when things are not going
well by someone's definition,

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
even when outcomes are not
presenting themselves in the

01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
way you wish they would have,
even when you're in a place of

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.010 align:middle line:90%
apprehension or fear.

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I have come to a new
acronym for fear--

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:02.261 align:middle line:90%
feeling excited and ready.

01:11:02.261 --> 01:11:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Bliss and joy--

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
this comes from that
inner process.

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, we just have to
remember who we are.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:09.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the remembering.

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.860 align:middle line:90%
We've forgotten.

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten that
we're souls.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten that
we are spirits.

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten our
spiritual essence.

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And all we have to do is
remember, because as you

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
remember these things, as you
remember that you're immortal,

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're eternal, and that
all of our loved ones and

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
everyone else is also, the
fears begin to disappear.

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Love seems to dissolve fear.

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Fear--

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
religions and institutions and
governments make us think

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
we're helpless by trying
to keep us afraid.

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:45.750 align:middle line:90%


01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:49.195 align:middle line:84%
The powers that be knows as
much about this as I know.

01:11:49.195 --> 01:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It had 15 million cases of
near death experiences.

01:11:52.210 --> 01:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
What do you do with
that information?

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:57.102 align:middle line:84%
Nothing, because it
reduces fear.

01:11:57.102 --> 01:12:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not afraid, then
you can't be controlled.

01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And the power of a
spiritual being--

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.156 align:middle line:84%
fear causes you to
stop breathing.

01:12:06.156 --> 01:12:10.660 align:middle line:84%
When you stop breathing, you
block the flow of the cycle of

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
energy through the
eight bodies.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot open your
consciousness to see what

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
really is happening.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why fear
is created.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people slow their
breath down and become

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
intent, because somebody knows
that that's the art form for

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:29.612 align:middle line:90%
divine unfoldment.

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
The power of breath and the
intent and the purpose of why

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
you live and what you move forth
with breathing in and

01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:40.430 align:middle line:84%
out is the power of the
spiritual progression.

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>That fear is actually
kind of useless.

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:47.170 align:middle line:90%
In many senses, it's useless.

01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:49.530 align:middle line:84%
If you use it properly,
it can be beneficial.

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Like say, OK, because of that,
I want to do something now.

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Then it's useful.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, just having that fear
is not really helpful.

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And instead of that,
we can say how we

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:06.060 align:middle line:90%
can really have control.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way we can really
have a control over this

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
experience of dying and death,
how we can transform that.

01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, that becomes
very beneficial for

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.290 align:middle line:90%
transforming of fear.

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Our task is to learn how to
get out of this life alive.

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do that is by
living every moment 100%

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
lifefully, and not allowing
lifelessness, which is the

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.040 align:middle line:90%
slow death--

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.480 align:middle line:90%
see, we don't die all at once.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.080 align:middle line:90%
We die little by little.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
When lifelessness begins to
creep into you, that is the

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.830 align:middle line:90%
worst of all deaths.

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And we experience infinity by
living life heartfully,

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:54.755 align:middle line:84%
courageously, every moment
aware, as if it were our last.

01:13:54.755 --> 01:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>The first thing that
you notice--

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:57.910 align:middle line:90%
because I had this happen--

01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
is that you have no body.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.900 align:middle line:90%
But it feels like a body.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.980 align:middle line:90%
You think you have a body.

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.930 align:middle line:84%
You feel like itching
your eye.

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you find you
don't have an eye.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.680 align:middle line:90%
You are without a body.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can go anywhere you
want to by thinking it.

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And you can do everything.

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you find out
that you have choices.

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:26.560 align:middle line:84%
You can live among the
forest or you can

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.080 align:middle line:90%
live in a Disney World.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out
you are a god.

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
You can create your
own destiny.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:37.040 align:middle line:84%
You are a small god doing
God's work for

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.030 align:middle line:90%
yourself and others.

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we eventually
will be when we unite with God

01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:45.550 align:middle line:90%
much, much later.

01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:46.690 align:middle line:90%
This is what I think.

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.760 align:middle line:90%
It may not be this way.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It may be totally different.

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:54.965 align:middle line:84%
>>And what I would say to
someone who was dying is, you

01:14:54.965 --> 01:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
are going to go through
a marvelous process of

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.640 align:middle line:90%
reidentification.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Death is a process of
reidentification.

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And the following things
will happen.

01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
First, you will come to know
instantly that you are not

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
your body, which will
be, by the way, a

01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
great relief to you.

01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:17.625 align:middle line:84%
Second, you will come to know
instantly that you are not

01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
your mind, which will
be, by the way, a

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:21.650 align:middle line:90%
great relief to you.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll come to know that,
because you'll start thinking

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
thinking about.

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, that which you
imagined to be your mind will

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
be stepping aside
from your mind.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And then a part of you will
say, I'm sorry, who is

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
thinking about my thoughts
if I'm not my thoughts?

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Then who is the thinker?

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it
will dawn on you--

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.540 align:middle line:90%
ah, I'm not my thoughts.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm not my mind.

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I am that which has thoughts.

01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:56.420 align:middle line:90%
But I am not even my thoughts.

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I must be, I guess,
what they all call a soul.

01:15:58.890 --> 01:15:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I guess they're right.

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.950 align:middle line:90%
I am a soul.

01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But then a third part of this
process will take place.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You'll come to realize you're
not even a soul in the sense

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
of being an essence that's
individuated or somehow

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.330 align:middle line:90%
separated from anything else.

01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
You will, in fact, be
individuated, even as my

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.795 align:middle line:84%
fingers are individuated, but
you will not be separated any

01:16:18.795 --> 01:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
more than my fingers are
separated from my hand and my

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:24.500 align:middle line:90%
hand from my body.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Because your mom's going
to need your help.

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Your brother's going
to need your help.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Your sister's going
to need your help.

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
They're going to need you to be
present, listening, loving.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And they will need you to draw
strength from as they make the

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
decisions in the value of
the distance they've

01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:45.420 align:middle line:90%
traveled in your life.

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:48.462 align:middle line:84%
And that's my reason for
telling these stories.

01:16:48.462 --> 01:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're a caregiver,
hold your loved one.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.856 align:middle line:90%
Touch them.

01:16:52.856 --> 01:16:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Caress them.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Let them know that
you love them.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Remember, death is
not contagious.

01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Many people don't want to touch
someone who's passing,

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
afraid that they might
pick something up.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Touch them and hold them.

01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:09.100 align:middle line:84%
The next thing is to give
them permission to die.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Tell them it's OK for them to
go, that you're going to be

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
all right, that you're going
to be taken care of.

01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
You'll look after your
siblings, that

01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:18.750 align:middle line:90%
don't have to worry.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Giving a person permission
to die is one of the most

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
important things that you can to
help them on their journey.

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Buddhist practice and the
Buddhist sensibility, which

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
has infiltrated other Asian
societies where it's been, so

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
it is kind of similar to the
Confucian one or the Taoist

01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:37.860 align:middle line:90%
one or the Hindu one--

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and it is that we are making
heaven or hell here and now.

01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And we do something bad,
and that leads

01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:47.460 align:middle line:90%
to a hellish condition.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.100 align:middle line:84%
We do something good, and that
leads to a heavenly condition.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, ultimately, we
want to get to the point where

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:56.350 align:middle line:84%
we would never do anything
negative so that there would

01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
be no dichotomy between heaven
and hell, actually-- that

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
enlightenment is beyond
trying to seek heaven.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It's where there's no dichotomy
and where there is

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
heaven on earth, in that sense,
and where one becomes

01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
capable of helping others find
their own life to be heavenly.

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's a greater goal than
just seeking heaven.

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>I think it's a preparation.

01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole thing
of earth and

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.450 align:middle line:90%
everything is a preparing.

01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know preparing
for what.

01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that when you
are very good and you work

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
very hard and all of that,
you can become a master.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>From this perspective, death
just becomes a journey into

01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the homeland of where everything
begins rather than

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:43.070 align:middle line:84%
the end of everything that
we've ever known.

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.125 align:middle line:84%
We'll just wake up one day and
we'll look at each other and

01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
we'll say, what were
we thinking?

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
What in the world were we
thinking when we did all those

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.752 align:middle line:84%
horrible things to
one another?

01:18:50.752 --> 01:18:53.145 align:middle line:90%
>>The earth is a school.

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a school that we're
born into to

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.890 align:middle line:90%
learn specific lessons.

01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous waiting
list for bodies--

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.200 align:middle line:90%
huge, extraordinary.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It is such a privilege
to be born.

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way that you cut into
the queue is to learn your

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
lessons well from
your last birth.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn your lessons
extremely well, you don't have

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to be reborn again
into this earth.

01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You can continue in your journey
of consciousness.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:25.470 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it is a
tremendous privilege to be

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
born and to learn through
physical body.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We came here for sensation,
for experience, not for

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.970 align:middle line:84%
abstinence, not for
living the monk's

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:36.500 align:middle line:90%
life, denying the world.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.320 align:middle line:84%
We want to embrace the
world, take it on,

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.610 align:middle line:90%
live it to the fullest.

01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But live it consciously, with
integrity, and hurt no one.

01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>You will, therefore,
re-member--

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.900 align:middle line:84%
that is, you'll become
a member once again--

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
of the body of God,
of all that is.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And you will have an experience
of that, not a

01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:02.060 align:middle line:84%
knowingness, not a sense of it,
not a conceptualization.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
You will actually
experience it.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:04.400 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.550 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced it.

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And you will know
experientially, my gosh,

01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:15.110 align:middle line:90%
there's only one thing.

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And all things are part of
the only thing there is.

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Sole purpose-- you have to
realize your sole purpose, in

01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
my opinion, is to be all that
you can be, a spirit in human

01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:27.970 align:middle line:90%
form helping other people.

01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:28.820 align:middle line:90%
That is your purpose.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Be all that you can be--
a divine being.

01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
People think that your sole
purpose is to be the mayor, to

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
be a writer.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
That's talents, gifts,
and ability.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
My sole purpose is not
to be a medium, an

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:41.555 align:middle line:90%
author, or a lecturer.

01:20:41.555 --> 01:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
That's just gifts that I have
to help me with my sole

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
purpose of being all
that I can be--

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual being
helping others.

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And you have to remember, when
we leave this world, all you

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
take with you is what you
did and didn't do.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, the important thing
here is to live this,

01:20:57.630 --> 01:21:01.320 align:middle line:84%
not just to understand these
concepts and to entertain them

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and to convince yourself that
because you and you understand

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.130 align:middle line:84%
them cognitively, that you've
experienced them.

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Shaman school and
vision quest--

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
monks go to meditate at
a mountain top or in a

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.560 align:middle line:90%
monastery for years.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a daily
practice, daily spiritual

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:22.400 align:middle line:84%
practice of infinity, because
infinity actually is the only

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
thing that brings you into
now, into the moment.

01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is talk.

01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>When you leave your physical
body and you go to the other

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
side, you're not taking your
house with you, your car, your

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:34.930 align:middle line:90%
bank accounts.

01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:36.930 align:middle line:84%
These things have to
be left behind.

01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:39.910 align:middle line:84%
You're taking your actions, your
deeds, how you treated

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and affected other people.

01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
take with you.

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So these are the important
things.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So as people focus
on these things--

01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
on reaching out to others
with love and

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.390 align:middle line:90%
compassion and caring--

01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and not being so concerned with
what comes back to you,

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.800 align:middle line:90%
because that doesn't matter.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Enough will come back anyway.

01:21:56.970 --> 01:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to worry about it.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you just reach out
without expecting anything in

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
return, you're going
to feel bliss.

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel happiness
because that's

01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.140 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual path.

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the purpose.

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:10.096 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
here to learn.

01:22:10.096 --> 01:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>If you do not believe that
there's life after death, you

01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:16.060 align:middle line:90%
will be surprised.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And subscribing to the belief
that there's no life after

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
death is actually an act of your
responsibility, because,

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
say, you don't need to care for
the planet for those that

01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:30.730 align:middle line:84%
come after us, which
is you as well.

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So this world was not created
for your pleasure alone, but

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
for your stewardship, and of
the future generations,

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.490 align:middle line:84%
including your return
to this world.

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>There's no way out of here.

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:47.190 align:middle line:84%
My slogan there is that I like
to repeat to people is nobody

01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:50.920 align:middle line:90%
gets out of here dead.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Since people in our culture who
are so scared of paying

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
the piper for centuries of
imperialism and Native

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.425 align:middle line:84%
American genocide and
destruction of the earth and

01:23:00.425 --> 01:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
all this, not to mention
ridiculous recent attempts at

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
neo-imperialism, they
just want to be out.

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a very suicidal type of
culture at the moment.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way getting
out of here just dying.

01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting into the
eternal rest cemetery at

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Fairlawn there and staying there
peacefully, exempt from

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:25.890 align:middle line:84%
the consequences of
their bad actions.

01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>So many people get there
through meditation.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think you need a kind
of service component, too.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to do things
physically, not just stay in

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:36.950 align:middle line:90%
an ashram or monastery.

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It's nice--

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and meditate--

01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
but you have to go out and help
people and be nonviolent

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and teach and reach out to
others and interact in that

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
way, helping them along
the spiritual path.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
That's where you find
bliss-- when you

01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:52.375 align:middle line:90%
understand about love.

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.975 align:middle line:84%
Then you don't need
to be anxious.

01:23:53.975 --> 01:23:55.305 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to be nervous.

01:23:55.305 --> 01:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be worried,
because about what?

01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.810 align:middle line:90%
You're immortal.

01:23:57.810 --> 01:23:59.680 align:middle line:90%
You're eternal.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
When we forget who we are,
that's when we feel anxiety.

01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:03.810 align:middle line:90%
That's when we feel nervous.

01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:05.420 align:middle line:90%
That's when we have worries.

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a bigger picture.

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:08.770 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole plan there.

01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
There's you and your higher self
and all the other souls

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual beings that
are helping you.

01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:16.250 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to worry.

01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:17.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be nervous.

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a much, much bigger
picture, a much greater

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.210 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
be sad and depressed

01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:29.270 align:middle line:90%
because there is no death.

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>When you achieve liberation,
you're free from the world.

01:24:34.890 --> 01:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
The world is a distinctly
human world.

01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
The earth is a natural place,
but the human world-- we have

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.420 align:middle line:84%
worldview, we have a world
that we've created, of

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:48.050 align:middle line:84%
concrete, of buildings, of
history, burdened by history,

01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:49.380 align:middle line:90%
by values and morals.

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You're free of the nightmare
of humanity.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And then you're free.

01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You're free to be born in this
planet anywhere and in any

01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:00.610 align:middle line:90%
form you wish.

01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:06.930 align:middle line:84%
You're free to be born in any
body that you choose to.

01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Evolution continues
beyond this earth.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.810 align:middle line:84%
There are other realms and other
domains that we get to

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%
inhabit beyond this one.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.150 align:middle line:90%
This is elementary school.

01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Just as much as we cannot
see, there is

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
past and future lives.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That much, also, we cannot see
there isn't past and there

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.640 align:middle line:90%
isn't future.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And so to be on the safer side,
just to prepare, as if

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.810 align:middle line:84%
there is something
to continue--

01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:37.734 align:middle line:90%
that's a safer way.

01:25:37.734 --> 01:25:41.638 align:middle line:84%
What if something continues
at the end?

01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:43.660 align:middle line:90%
We will be totally--

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:44.170 align:middle line:90%
what do you call--

01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:46.530 align:middle line:90%
caught unprepared.

01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe that infinity is
about the end of time as we

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:51.610 align:middle line:90%
have known it.

01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
As we come to the end of time,
prophesied by the indigenous

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:59.710 align:middle line:84%
peoples, what we're going to
have the opportunity and the

01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
necessity is to step into
timelessness collectively.

01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to ensure
the survival of humanity.

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, we're going to
be swallowed by time.

01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be unable to
swim in the river of time

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
because it'll become too
chaotic, too much happening at

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:23.700 align:middle line:84%
once for us to be able
to tolerate.

01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>You will be reunited with all
of your loved ones, all

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
those who have gone before,
and those you think you're

01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:32.750 align:middle line:90%
leaving behind.

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:36.930 align:middle line:84%
That person might say, oh, you
mean even the people that I've

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:37.540 align:middle line:90%
left behind?

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.300 align:middle line:90%
My grandchildren and my--

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:41.230 align:middle line:90%
yes.

01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, even those people will meet
you on the other side at

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
the moment that you do what
you would call cross over.

01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:50.560 align:middle line:84%
That person might think,
well, oh, my gosh.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that to happen.

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them to have to end
their lives just because

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm ending mine.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.960 align:middle line:90%
What are you telling me?

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
To which I would answer,
no, no, no.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.370 align:middle line:84%
They haven't ended
their lives.

01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
They live their fully
and completely.

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I don't have to wait for
them on the other side for

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
them to finish living
their lives?

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You would have to wait
for them if there was

01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:12.020 align:middle line:90%
such a thing as time.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.620 align:middle line:90%
But actually, there's not.

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So in the eternal when-where,
they will be there.

01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you do the thing called
cross over, when you

01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:26.720 align:middle line:84%
experience your continuation
day, you will therefore be

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.625 align:middle line:84%
reunited instantaneously with
all those human beings you

01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.290 align:middle line:90%
have so deeply loved--

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
the souls, the essence
of all of them.

01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And we will be together again,
saying, now, that was fun.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again.

01:27:44.610 --> 01:32:32.300 align:middle line:90%
