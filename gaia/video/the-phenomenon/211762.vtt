It also listed
aerodynamic capabilities

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
with disturbing implications
for national defense,

extreme rates of climb,
dazzling maneuverability,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.358 align:middle line:84%
and a superior capacity
for evasive action.

00:10:21.358 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people expected that
the United States government

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:10%
was about to confirm,
OK, they're ours.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:84%
This is an exciting new
technological advance

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:90%
that we were testing.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time to
tell people about it.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Occasionally, eyewitness
testimony included compelling

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
photographic evidence.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:90%

Evelyn Trent was
feeding her rabbits

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:84%
when she spotted a
metallic, disk-shaped object

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:90%
floating over their farm.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:10%
She alerted her husband
Paul to grab his camera,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:10%
and he managed to get two shots.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
They describe the
object slowly hovering

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:90%
before it abruptly sped away.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:10%
"Life Magazine"
picked up the story,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:10%
and the McMinnville UFO
became a global sensation.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:10%
>> There was no chance
of this being weather.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
There was no chance of this
being a star or an aircraft.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
This is either some kind
of structured object

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know what
it is or it's a hoax.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Paul Trent and his
wife, they were honest,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
simple, hardworking
people who never

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
made a dime off the
photographs that they took.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
They never tried to
make a dime off of it.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:10%
>> It just come up like that.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:10%
And then it tipped and
just [IMITATES WHOOSH],,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, really went.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:90%
It went fast.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything
go so fast in my life

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:90%
as that thing went.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1951, future
astronaut Gordon Cooper,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
while training in Germany,
chased a large formation with

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:90%
his squadron of fighter jets.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Unlike fighters,
they would stop,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
almost stop in their forward
velocity and change 90 degrees,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:90%
sometimes in their flight path.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:10%
And within the next
two to three days,

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.348 align:middle line:10%
we had practically
all the fighters

00:12:20.348 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:10%
we could muster on the base up
climbing as high as they would

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:10%
climb with guys with
binoculars with them,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:10%
still trying to spot these
strange devices flying

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:10%
overhead.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.410 align:middle line:10%
And we never could get close
enough really to pin them down,

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:10%
but they were round in shaped
and very metallic looking.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And they would come over
and do the same maneuvers

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:10%
that we make, except there
was one of them to go zip.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And you just can't
do that in a fighter.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Like two saucers, one
inverted over the other.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be made of
some kind of polished metal.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.952 align:middle line:84%
When I first saw the objects,
they were almost overhead.

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
By the time I had the
camera ready to go,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.743 align:middle line:84%
they had moved to a
considerably greater distance.

00:13:08.743 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:84%

eight huge disks fly

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:10%
from Washington DC.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:10%
>> When it came out over
the blackness of the bay,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.370 align:middle line:10%
they're distinct six red coins.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
When they got closer, we
could see that you were--

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
it looked like you were looking
down into it, like a hot coal.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:10%

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:90%
That kind of really shook us up.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the
thing shook us up.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could have
gotten to that degree

of scientific progress without
some of the intermediate steps

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:90%
having become public knowledge.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.365 align:middle line:84%

The nation's Capitol was

Seven unknown blips
suddenly appeared on radar

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:90%
at Washington National Airport.

>> Capitol Building, the White
House where the president

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
lived, these were some of

in the country when it
comes to national defense.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And there were UFOs
violating this airspace.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:10%
And there was nothing that the
Air Force could do about it.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> F-94 interceptors
were scrambled.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Pentagon Press Liaison Al

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%
that night.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We could see the planes
coming in on this radar scope.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:10%
And the minute we saw the
beginning of these guys,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:10%
the UFOs disappeared.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:90%
They just left.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:84%
They obviously, whatever
these things were,

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
had intelligence enough
to get out of the area

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
when we had an
intercept going in.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But the next
weekend, it began again.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Pilot William Patterson
pushed his Starfire jet

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
to maximum speed
to try to intercept

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.695 align:middle line:90%
one of the glowing objects.

00:16:19.695 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>> He actually said,
they're closing in on me.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:90%
What shall I do?

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:90%
It was frightening.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The Air Force had just
issued orders to shoot down

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the unknowns if, quote,
"they can't talk them down."

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not going to tell an Air
Force pilot to fire at the damn

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:90%
thing or anything.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say anything.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:10%
Nobody said anything.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, things
began to move away from him,

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:90%
and he said, they're gone.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced they're
solid objects.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that they're
probably from another planet

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:90%
or from outer space somewhere.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I've always felt that
way since that night.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:10%
General Roger Ramey,
Air Force Director

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:10%
of Operations at the Pentagon,
Captain Edward Ruppelt

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:10%

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:10%
General John Samford.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:10%

Of this great mass
of reports, we

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:10%
have been able adequately to
explain the great bulk of them.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
However, there have been
a certain percentage

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
of this volume of
reports that had

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
been made by credible
observers of relatively

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:90%
incredible things.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
We can say that the
recent sightings are

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
in no way connected with
any secret development

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
by any department of
the United States.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Q&A with reporters,
Samford suggested a 50/50

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:10%
chance it could have been radar
waves bouncing off temperature

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:10%
inversions.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The point that Samford put
across all too effectively was

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:10%
that they were not real.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:84%
They were just tricks
of the atmosphere.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:10%
And atmospheric
phenomena can't be

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:10%
a threat to national security.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:90%
You don't shoot at clouds.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The public was pondering
the implications of possible

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial contact.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Robert L. Farnsworth,
president of the United States

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:10%
Rocket Society, urged defense
officials not to permit

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:10%
our planes to fire at
any flying saucers.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:10%
He says this might alienate
mankind from beings

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:10%
of far superior forces.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Farnsworth feels that
friendly contact should

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:90%
be sought as long as possible.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Behind the scenes, the
CIA had other concerns.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:10%
A secret internal memo
urged immediate attention

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:10%
to unexplained objects in the
vicinity of major US defense

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:10%
installations.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I would dare say, if anything
happened that we thought was

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:10%
a threat to our national
security, somebody out there,

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:10%
one of the services,
would respond to it.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Remember, this is the
height of the Cold War.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:10%
OK, there are
bombers on both sides

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:10%
loaded with nuclear bombs.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Jacques Vallee was the
inspiration for the French UFO

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:10%
researcher in Steven Spielberg's
"Close Encounters of the Third

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.954 align:middle line:10%
Kind."

00:20:33.954 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you recently
had a close encounter?

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> In real life, Dr. Vallee
conducted sober scientific

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:90%
research on the phenomenon.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We know now that there
is no simple answer.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:10%
>> For decades, he met
with witnesses and traveled

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:10%
the globe gathering evidence,
ultimately creating the first

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:10%
database on the UFO subject.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. Chairman, all the
great nations of the world are

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:10%
represented on this committee.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.840 align:middle line:10%
Let us keep in mind that the
UFO phenomenon may represent

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:10%
an even greater reality.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Vallee also consulted
with scientific, military,

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:10%
and government officials,
including Project Blue

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.145 align:middle line:10%
Book's top science advisor,
Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:10%


00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:10%
>> I began my work as scientific
consultant to the United States

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:10%
Air Force as an open skeptic.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Hynek was a university
astronomer with a high security

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
clearance when the Air Force
recruited him to investigate

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.527 align:middle line:90%
UFOs.

00:21:39.527 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:10%
>> And it so happened when the
Air Force got the job of trying

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:10%
to figure out what some of these
strange flying saucer stories

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:10%
were about, well, they needed
an astronomer to see how many

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:10%
of the reports could possibly
be explained as meteors,

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:10%
and twinkling
stars, and planets.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The two scientists became
close colleagues with Hynek

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
entrusting Vallee to index
the reams of Blue Book files

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
scattered throughout
Hynek's home.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It was there that Vallee made
a chance discovery of a letter

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:84%
so secret he had to appeal to
the Chief Counsel of the Senate

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Defense Appropriations Committee
to get it declassified.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That document
changed my life.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It taught me that the subject
had been taken much more

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:90%
seriously than anybody thought.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The document
revealed an ultrasecret,

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
highly-funded scientific
investigation working parallel

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
to Blue Book unknown to
all but a select few.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:10%
The letter was signed
by H. C. Cross,

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:10%
Director of Exotic Metallurgy at
Battelle National Laboratories.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:10%
>> These were the people who had
analyzed the files with a large

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:10%
budget, with highly competent
physicists and computer

00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:10%
scientists.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Who are these people?

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:90%
What information did they have?

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Good evening.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:10%
Tonight, we go after a
fantastic story, the story

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:10%
that flying saucers
from other worlds

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:10%
are visiting our planet just
as we are exploring outer space

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:10%
with our own rocket satellites.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Our guest is former Marine
Air Corps Major Donald

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Keyhoe in his campaign to prove
that flying saucers exist.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:90%
My name is Mike Wallace.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:90%
The cigarette is Parliament.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Why will the United States
government withhold information

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:90%
from United States citizens?

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:90%
For what reason?

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The Air Force is simply
treating the American people

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:90%
like children.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.742 align:middle line:84%
They don't trust
them with the facts.

00:23:42.742 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:10%
>> During the '50s and '60s, it
wasn't just the Americans who

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:10%
were seeing flying saucers.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:10%
At the Westall
school in Australia,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:10%
several hundred students saw an
object hovering over this power

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:10%
line tower on their athletic
field, an event they vividly

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.382 align:middle line:10%
recall 50 years later.

00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>> A student came into
the classroom, you know,

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:10%
[GASPS] there's flying
saucers in the oval.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:10%
There's flying saucers.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:90%
And everybody ran out.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the fear and the
hysteria of all the students.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:10%
>> I couldn't believe it
because what I was seeing

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:10%
wasn't possible.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It was vertical,
horizontal, move away from us,

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:10%
back towards us, appear
somewhere else, somewhere else.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.677 align:middle line:10%
>> My god, you know,
but it was exciting.

00:24:34.677 --> 00:24:35.510 align:middle line:10%
>> It was like that.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:10%
And then all of a sudden,
it just turned on its side.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that
it was around disk.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The children saw the disk
begin to descend into this

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
wooded reserve at the end of
the school's running path.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:10%
>> I ran towards the corner of
the school, jumped the fence,

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:10%
and ran towards where it
looked as though it went down

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:10%
into the trees, and then stopped
dead because it was right

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:10%
in front of me on the ground.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Like a disk with a slight
rise in the middle.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I also heard a low sort
of a humming noise,

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.605 align:middle line:84%
and I felt a bit of a heat
coming off it as well.

00:25:09.605 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And it started to take off
pretty well straight away it,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:84%
had all bluey, purple
lights around the bottom.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
seeing any windows.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And it took off to about
probably 4 or 5 meters

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:84%
in the air, and then
turned on its side,

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and just went zoom,
straight up so

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:84%
fast that there's
just nothing even now

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:90%
day that could go that fast.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Shortly after
the object departed,

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:84%
the authorities
converged on the school.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:10%
>> We had army, air force,
police down there cordoning off

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:10%
the area to prevent any of us
entering the area or disturbing

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:10%
anything.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:10%
>> We got called to assembly.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:10%
The headmaster said,
you have not seen this.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.610 align:middle line:90%
You do not talk about it.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:90%
You'll be in trouble if you do.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:10%
>> For the first time ever, the
school science teacher agreed

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.600 align:middle line:10%
to describe what
he saw that day,

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:10%
providing we concealed
his identity.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.680 align:middle line:10%
>> It was not a mirage.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:10%
There was something
physical in the sky.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:10%
It was silver.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:10%
It could hover.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:10%
It could move slowly.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:90%
It could move very rapidly.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it moved away to
the other side of the oval

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:90%
and down behind some pine trees.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I was not then
nor ever have been

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:84%
able to use my
knowledge of the world

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
nor my scientific training to
provide a rational explanation.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:10%
>> What he said next sheds light
on why the school's staff have

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:10%
remained silent all these years.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a knock
on the door one night.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Two older men, one in uniform,
asked for my description

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:90%
of what I'd seen.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I was then told that I
hadn't seen anything,

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:84%
but I'd made it all up,
possibly because I was drunk.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And that they would
have to report that fact

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:90%
to the education department.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:90%
And I would lose my job.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
After that, I was told
that I would be prosecuted

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:90%
under the Official Secrets Act.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that there
wasn't anything there,

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
when I knew there was, and that
I had to keep quiet about it.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Why did I have to keep quiet?

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The Westall landing may not
have been an isolated incident.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Four days prior, a then young
engineer in nearby Balwyn

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.470 align:middle line:84%
was taking photos in
his mother's garden

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.360 align:middle line:90%
when something caught his eye.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> This tremendous
flash of light.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and
I saw this object.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And I pulled--

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I had a Polaroid camera.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I pulled this up, hit
myself on my face.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And I took the picture.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:90%
And I got the photograph here.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.455 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
original Polaroid?

00:27:58.455 --> 00:27:59.255 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:27:59.255 --> 00:28:00.055 align:middle line:90%
It certainly is.

00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it was made
out of some form of metal

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:90%
and it was engineered.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:18.157 align:middle line:84%
And being an engineer,
I was sure it was.

00:28:18.157 --> 00:28:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
took the photograph,

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.670 align:middle line:90%
and it tipped around.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.795 align:middle line:90%
And I could see the bottom.

00:28:21.795 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like it
was rotating to me.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, it
sort of gave a bounce,

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and it rocketed away to the
north at very high speed.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe
the acceleration?

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It was like
almost instantaneous,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.330 align:middle line:84%
like it had been
shot out of a gun.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Wham, you know.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Air Force officers
showed up at his doorstep,

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:48.510 align:middle line:84%
asking for every detail
of his experience.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And they also had some
photographs of similar things.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And they also had
a book, which had

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:84%
pictures of things in which
they didn't leave with me.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The analysts had
to look through.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But they said it was an
unidentified flying object.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> What was the implication?

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> That it didn't come
from anywhere on Earth.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Project Blue Book with
a skeletal staff continued

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:84%
publicly collecting
thousands of cases.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:10%
Despite efforts to
explain them away,

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:10%
hundreds were still
filed as unknown.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.355 align:middle line:10%
>> Several reports of a strange
egg-shaped object about 200

00:29:37.355 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:10%
feet long landing on farms
and highways last night

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:10%
in the vicinity of Levelland.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Sheriff Clem says
he even himself

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:10%
got a glimpse of the thing,
which somehow turned off

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:10%
lights and auto engines
when it came near.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:10%
>> The object did take
off almost straight up

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:10%
at a terrific speed.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Within 24 to 36 hours after
these sightings in Levelland,

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:10%
Texas, at the White
Sands Proving Ground,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:10%
very close to the Trinity test
site where they first detonated

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:10%
the first atomic bomb, military
personnel witnessed a glowing

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:10%
egg-shaped object that
apparently landed.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Bill Haggard,
public information officer,

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:10%
White Sands Proving
Ground, New Mexico.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.750 align:middle line:10%
What they saw looked like
a landing and takeoff

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:10%
of some controlled
object from outer space.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:51.630 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I was chasing
a car up Park Street.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:90%
It was reckless driving.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:10%
I saw this big
cloud of smoke, so I

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:10%
decided to let go of the car
and go up there and investigate.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:08.740 align:middle line:10%
By the time I got there, I
could see a big white object

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:10%
sitting in the arroyo.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.435 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't tell what
it was at first.

00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:10%
My radio was dead.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.305 align:middle line:10%
It didn't work at all.

00:31:21.305 --> 00:31:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.530 align:middle line:10%
I could see some figures,
looked like they were

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:10%
walking around the craft there.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>> They appeared to be dressed
in white coveralls and were

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.760 align:middle line:90%
child-like, that is small.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.690 align:middle line:10%
>> One was in front,
the other in back.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Zamora added that one of
the two persons turned his head

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and looked straight at him.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When I got out of the
car, about 50 feet from it,

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I guess they saw me because they
started their motor or whatever

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.080 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I could see a big blast of fire
coming from right under it.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So I was behind some bushes
there, behind my car.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I could see it and I
could feel that heat.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.357 align:middle line:90%
That really got me scared.

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say, why don't
you take your gun out and shoot

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:90%
at it?

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And that they weren't
doing nothing to me.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It just took a little
while to get airborne,

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:84%
came up a little bit
about 20, 30 feet,

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and it stayed there a while,
in a state just as quiet

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.200 align:middle line:90%
as it could be.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And then just flew away.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Lonnie was very, very scared.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:90%
He was as white as a sheet.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:84%
From here, went directly to the
church to talk to the priest.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Pablo Lopez was among the
first to arrive at the landing

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:10%
and takeoff site.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The ground was still
smoldering in some of the weeds

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:90%
that were around it.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> This rare footage gives us
a glimpse of the scene shortly

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:90%
after the incident.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Patrolman Zamora stoops to point
out one of the landing gear

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
imprints where officers had
just placed rocks to protect

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:90%
the fresh ground traces.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there was a
set-- two sets of footprints,

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:90%
two sets of footprints, like so.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
That was about the
approximate size of them.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:84%
In comparison to a quarter,
that's pretty small.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:90%
That's about the size of them.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Within an hour and over
the next several days,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:10%
officials from
the FBI, military,

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.165 align:middle line:10%
and Project Blue Book documented
the evidence at the scene.

00:33:58.165 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:10%
>> Were there any prong marks
on the ground or anything like

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:10%
that where you could
see where it had landed?

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.389 align:middle line:90%
>> There were four.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Very unusual footprints.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:16.120 align:middle line:90%
How many were there?

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Two footprints on one side
and two footprints in the other

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:18.959 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, the
burn area there.

00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I was behind my car.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I could see it and I
could feel that heat.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:33.600 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:84%
They told me that
all over the state,

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:38.100 align:middle line:84%
they had been seen some
of those flying saucers

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.600 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you call them.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:90%
They gave me a book on it.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:84%
And they told me to
go ahead and read it.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And well, it says not
to say nothing on it.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Keep away from it.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Don't say too much.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the middle of the
night by the time Lonnie came

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he was real pale.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:90%
And I thought he was sick.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:10%
I said, are you
sick or something?

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:10%
He said, no.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.840 align:middle line:10%
He said, I was just working.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.065 align:middle line:84%
He was like--
like, he was angry.

00:35:07.065 --> 00:35:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:84%
What I knew about it was when
I started reading the papers.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It started coming out, and
coming out, and everything.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what's
this that you saw?

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.816 align:middle line:10%
He said it's just a headache.

00:35:22.816 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:10%
He said everybody's after me.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And some believe
me and some don't.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Dear Mr. Zamora.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Dear Mr. Zamora.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Dear Mr. Zamora,
I'm interested in UFOs.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I believe you saw an
egg-shaped spacecraft.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:90%
It had passengers--

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.888 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw a UFO myself
in the summer of 1958.

00:35:42.888 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I could go on for a week
telling you what I've seen.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.223 align:middle line:84%
>> A boy in our school science
fair has three pictures that

00:35:49.223 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:84%
look just like the flying
saucer you describe.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought I should write to
you to tell you that you are

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.420 align:middle line:84%
not alone in your
sighting of this object.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I have pictures of a
couple egg-shaped ships taken--

00:35:59.793 --> 00:36:01.585 align:middle line:84%
>> I read about you
seeing a flying saucer.

00:36:01.585 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a retired teacher.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have a
friend who believes you.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.585 align:middle line:84%
>> This saucer phenomenon
has changed my life in ideas.

00:36:06.585 --> 00:36:11.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Farmer said when it took
off, it set his lawn on fire.

00:36:11.229 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Officers and
dozens of people saw--

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell me how long
it stayed on Earth and other

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:10%
things like that?

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Then people started making
fun of him that he had seen

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.910 align:middle line:84%
little men from outer
space, or this and that,

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.315 align:middle line:84%
and a whole bunch
of dirty stuff.

00:36:32.315 --> 00:36:35.307 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.307 --> 00:36:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people asked me,
is that the reason you quit

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.720 align:middle line:90%
the police force?

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
No, the reason I
quit the police force

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.300 align:middle line:84%
because I was going into a
lot of publicity and stuff

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.558 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to hurt the town.

00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The level of inquiry went
all the way to the Office

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:90%
of the President.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:84%
To this day, the Socorro close
encounter remains unexplained.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Socorro was very similar
to the French cases that I had

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:11.050 align:middle line:10%
brought to Hynek's attention,
checked by the police,

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:10%
checked by the French Air Force,
where they were also occupants

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.085 align:middle line:10%
who were seen, short beings in
connection with the objects.

00:37:21.085 --> 00:37:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:10%
I think that's
what convinced him

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.910 align:middle line:10%
that there were UFO landings
in the United States.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Look like a toy top,
somewhat upside down.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:10%
>> So this is the diagram
in which we've come up with.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.280 align:middle line:84%
It's more flat here
other than round,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.470 align:middle line:84%
but it does have
the hump up in here.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:10%
>> It seemed to move off
the ground, if it was down.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.020 align:middle line:10%
And then we saw three lights
that went from yellow to red.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.240 align:middle line:10%
>> We got right up to it.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:10%
It lit up.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it really become bright.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:10%
And we could see it, the
outline of it, real good.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Blue Book's Doctor Allen
Hynek investigated one

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:10%
of the alleged landing sites
with the local sheriff.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:20.350 align:middle line:10%
At an overflow press conference
later that day, the world

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:10%
held its breath for an historic
revelation about the landings

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:10%
in Michigan.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.910 align:middle line:10%
Hynek, by now privately
convinced of the UFO reality,

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:10%
struggled to follow the Air
Force policy of tamping down

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.712 align:middle line:10%
public excitement.

00:38:37.712 --> 00:38:39.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you saying that the
sightings in the Ann Arbor

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.850 align:middle line:10%
and Hillsdale areas definitely
were caused by marsh gases?

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm saying that the two cases
that I investigated most deeply

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.493 align:middle line:90%
were most likely.

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:10%
I said in a statement
that I couldn't prove it

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:52.785 align:middle line:10%
in a court of law,
but it seems--

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:55.368 align:middle line:10%
>> In other words, you're saying
then that you don't know what

00:38:55.368 --> 00:38:56.390 align:middle line:10%
caused it.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's not quite right.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that a person can be
pretty sure about something

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.107 align:middle line:84%
without being able to
convict somebody of a murder.

00:39:04.107 --> 00:39:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you believe--

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you say--

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I do honestly in
this case, in this case.

00:39:10.058 --> 00:39:12.350 align:middle line:10%
>> But you can't say without
question that this is what

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.150 align:middle line:10%
caused it?

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Hynek's strained explanation,
which he later called his

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:84%
greatest regret,
ignited a public furor.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. Ford, what
about flying saucers?

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.270 align:middle line:84%
You've had some in
Michigan in the past week.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Dave, we've had several
incidents that many felt were

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:36.080 align:middle line:84%
sufficient to justify some
action by our government

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and not the kind of flippant
answer that was given

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:84%
by the Air Force, where they
passed it off as swamp gas.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that
this mystery does

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:84%
require that the Congress
take a good look at it.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Let them put their
record on the line.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> On April 5, 1966,
congressional hearings were

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.940 align:middle line:84%
held with Dr. Hynek and
Secretary of the Air Force

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Harold Brown both
giving testimony.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Mr. Ford has come out.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.420 align:middle line:84%
He has a pretty good sized
stature in the Congress.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And so Mr. Secretary,
see if you can

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
shed some light on these
highly illuminated objects.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. Secretary, there have
been charges that the Air Force

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is hiding something
in the UFO field.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>> We have not been
hiding anything.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:10%
The investigations
have been made public.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.450 align:middle line:10%
The hearing this morning was
public for just that reason.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.180 align:middle line:10%
>> There has never been
any evidence presented

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:10%
to the United States Air Force
or discovered by the United

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.960 align:middle line:10%
States Air Force which
would indicate that the UFO

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.310 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon represents any
interplanetary space vehicle

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.120 align:middle line:10%
of any kind.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Amid growing pressure,
the Air Force commissioned

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:10%
an outside panel of scientists
to analyze select cases

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:10%
and settle the matter
once and for all.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It was headed by
physicist Edward Condon.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Condon, do you hope to
find people from outer space

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth?

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know for sure,
but we'll try to just study

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:84%
the reports and get as much
additional information as we

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.920 align:middle line:90%
can to see.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you like to have us
being visited by these little

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:90%
or big things?

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that would be fine with
me if I hope they're friendly.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.090 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you
propose to go about--

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.890 align:middle line:10%
>> After the project
was launched,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Condon remarked to an audience
that he thought the UFO subject

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:10%
was nonsense, but, quote, "I'm
not supposed to reach that

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.030 align:middle line:10%
conclusion for another year."

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:54.020 align:middle line:84%
After a two-year investigation,
the panel submitted a massive

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:84%
1,400-page report, showing
that many cases were radar

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and weather anomalies, but
confirming a number as truly

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.210 align:middle line:90%
unexplainable.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:10%
Among them were the famous
McMinnville photos taken

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.900 align:middle line:10%
on the Trent family
farm, as well as

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:17.070 align:middle line:10%
film footage of refers
in Great Falls, Montana.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> As I looked up, I saw two
silvery objects moving swiftly

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:21.900 align:middle line:90%
out of the northwest.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
No sound, except I thought
I heard a whooshing

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.220 align:middle line:90%
sound when I first saw them.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.770 align:middle line:84%
The disks appeared to
be spinning like a top

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and were about 50
feet across, which

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:84%
was much slower than the
jets were shot by shortly

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:35.600 align:middle line:90%
after I filmed the disks.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I could not see any exhaust,
wings, or any kind of fuselage.

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.140 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be of
a bright shiny metal,

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.400 align:middle line:90%
like polished silver.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.440 align:middle line:10%
>> There are cases that are
not explainable in conventional

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.460 align:middle line:10%
terms.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.070 align:middle line:10%
There is the assumption
of intelligence

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:59.990 align:middle line:10%
or intelligent control but
not necessarily the assumption

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.670 align:middle line:10%
of direct communication.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.740 align:middle line:90%
What do they want from us?

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.700 align:middle line:90%
What are their motivations?

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was Dr. Condon
who wrote the final word.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:17.620 align:middle line:10%
"There appears to be no
verified and fully satisfactory

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.770 align:middle line:10%
evidence of any
case that is clearly

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:24.250 align:middle line:10%
outside the framework of
presently known science

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.350 align:middle line:10%
and technology."

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I wouldn't count
really on that one.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.760 align:middle line:10%
You'd have to conclude that's
what we were looking at

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.300 align:middle line:10%
was beyond our current
state of the knowledge.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.220 align:middle line:10%
>> But it began
to hit me that Dr.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Condon has apparently not
read his own material very

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.970 align:middle line:10%
carefully.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:10%
When you do an actual
tabulation, which

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.970 align:middle line:10%
he doesn't seem to
have done, and you

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.410 align:middle line:10%
find his percentage
of unexplained

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:49.660 align:middle line:10%
is five to six times
larger than the Air Force.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet what is his
principal recommendation?

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.800 align:middle line:84%
The principal recommendation
that Dr. Condon

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.425 align:middle line:84%
has come through with is there's
nothing of scientific interest

00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that warrants further
attention on the part

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
of the federal government
here in any major way.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:84%

the whole problem.

>> Nobody could get funded,
nobody would look at the data

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that the problem
had been solved.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force closed
their reporting system.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So that if the public
wanted to report something,

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:84%
they would report it
to the local police,

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:84%
but it would never get to the
attention of scientists really

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.390 align:middle line:90%

that was swept under the rug

was the pervasive

Its silos packed with Minuteman
missiles, each one nearly 100

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:23.200 align:middle line:84%
times more powerful than the
bomb that devastated Hiroshima.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Launch officers could, within
minutes of confirmation,

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:30.310 align:middle line:84%
send their birds
arcing 6,000 miles

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:35.560 align:middle line:84%
to incinerate key Soviet
cities, triggering a war that

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.540 align:middle line:90%
would end our civilization.

I was the observer.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.950 align:middle line:10%
Basically, what I was doing
was the star observation

00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.430 align:middle line:10%
to provide precise
latitude and longitude

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.250 align:middle line:10%
on our small three-man team.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Came from the north and
stopped right over us.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And it had a white light
from the center looking down

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:13.270 align:middle line:90%
into the silo.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I just said to myself,
what if this thing beams us

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:84%
up and takes us off
to some distant place

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and never returned
to Earth again?

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.472 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
going through my head

00:47:21.472 --> 00:47:23.560 align:middle line:84%
here while this
thing's above me.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:28.373 align:middle line:84%
And then from this dead stop,
it shoots off to the east,

00:47:28.373 --> 00:47:30.040 align:middle line:84%
just like now you see
it, now you don't.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.840 align:middle line:90%
It just--

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:09.690 align:middle line:84%

or unlaunchable.

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:14.066 align:middle line:90%

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.090 align:middle line:10%
at the same time, let alone 10.

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:32.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I was a top secret
control officer,

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.430 align:middle line:10%
and I passed out nuclear
launch authenticators.

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I can clearly recall
a message coming

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:41.200 align:middle line:84%
through my communications
center which basically

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.550 align:middle line:84%
said that a UFO did in fact
shut down several missile

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:46.960 align:middle line:90%
silos in Montana.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:53.550 align:middle line:90%

They were three to
five miles away.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Sir, lack
of a better description,

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.110 align:middle line:84%
there's a flying saucer
hovering over that missile.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beam of reddish
light going down to it.

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.620 align:middle line:84%
It had to be a data
collection thing.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they scanned
the warhead or something.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:20.640 align:middle line:90%

He said, the UFO.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I took several security

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I also had my small cassette

He's coming toward us now.

00:50:41.585 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're observing
what appears

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.262 align:middle line:84%
to be a beam coming
down to the ground.

00:50:46.262 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:90%
This is unreal.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>> We stood there in awe.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Was this just a warning?

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Was this an attempt
to communicate?

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Was this a weapon
or just a probe?

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Just as suddenly as it
appeared, click, disappeared.

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:04.480 align:middle line:90%
We stood there, ah.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.910 align:middle line:84%
About that time, we noticed
the other object to the south

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:09.490 align:middle line:84%
was sending down beams,
about a mile and a half

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.340 align:middle line:84%
away over Woodbridge Base,
when we had great difficulties

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.300 align:middle line:90%
communicating.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But we were able to
discern some of those beams

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:18.220 align:middle line:84%
were either falling into or
near the weapons storage area,

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and there's a great
deal of concern.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I also found out later
that both the tower

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:26.230 align:middle line:84%
operators at Bentwaters
saw an object

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and picked it up on their
Brite II radar and watched it.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.160 align:middle line:10%
>> I was just sitting there,
and I happened to see a dot come

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.300 align:middle line:10%
on the scope.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.510 align:middle line:10%
And it just went like
one dot of beginning,

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.130 align:middle line:10%
then another dot, and
another dot, and it was gone.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And then it made a
immediate right-hand turn

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:44.050 align:middle line:90%
and came right towards the base.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Just absolutely phenomenal.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:50.050 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not like any radar
target I've ever seen traveling

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.690 align:middle line:10%
at extremely high rate of speed.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It passed over the control
tower and then it stopped.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.680 align:middle line:90%
It was an orange-ish color.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Sort of popped into
my mind at the time

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that somebody's flying
a basketball out here.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.860 align:middle line:84%
There were lights
around the center of it.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It was more like portholes, and
then you were seeing the light

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.840 align:middle line:90%
from the inside.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But it hovered momentarily,
reversed its course,

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.665 align:middle line:84%
and went back out at
a high rate of speed.

00:52:20.665 --> 00:52:24.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:27.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Even more alarming incidents
took place on both sides

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.870 align:middle line:10%
of the Cold War.

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.200 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.500 align:middle line:10%
According to one secret
Soviet documents,

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:39.250 align:middle line:10%
a UFO hovered over a
Ukrainian nuclear base

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.560 align:middle line:10%
for nearly an hour.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Inexplicably, several
missiles suddenly switched

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to full combat readiness
and began a launch sequence

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:52.690 align:middle line:84%
without any
authentication codes.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:56.620 align:middle line:84%
After 15 heart stopping
seconds, the countdown

00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:03.420 align:middle line:84%
to a potential Armageddon ceased
as abruptly as it had started.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.000 align:middle line:10%
>> As this object passed
over the missile site,

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.330 align:middle line:10%
we will start getting erratic
indications on that missile.

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.090 align:middle line:10%
The bad thing was we also
got a launch indicator.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Does that mean that the
launch sequence has been

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.720 align:middle line:10%
triggered?

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.080 align:middle line:10%
>> That means that the missile
has received a launch signal.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.640 align:middle line:84%
The countdown had to
be manually aborted.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> We have UFOs in the area.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> These witnesses are some of
the most highly vetted military

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:32.040 align:middle line:84%
officers in charge of the
world's most devastating

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.900 align:middle line:90%
armaments.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.390 align:middle line:84%
If what they're
reporting is accurate,

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.990 align:middle line:84%
then the pattern
is hard to avoid.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.920 align:middle line:84%
UFOs have been making
incursions into top security

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.800 align:middle line:84%
nuclear facilities
decade after decade.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>> To me, it's pretty clear.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.220 align:middle line:84%
This is just-- we're
shining a light on this.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.907 align:middle line:90%
We're pointing it out.

00:53:53.907 --> 00:53:55.865 align:middle line:84%
What are you people doing
with nuclear weapons?

00:53:55.865 --> 00:54:42.585 align:middle line:90%


00:54:42.585 --> 00:54:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> As the '90s dawned
and the walls fell down,

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.370 align:middle line:84%
it was as if humanity itself
was demanding to be seen as one

00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:52.890 align:middle line:90%
people and one world.

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.020 align:middle line:90%
The Soviet Union had dissolved.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And history's spotlight began to
shine on long darkened corners.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Different officials were
looking for ways to open

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:08.250 align:middle line:10%
dialogue with the West and
embrace all the changes that

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:11.220 align:middle line:10%
were underway in their
country at the time.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> This is George Knapp in
Moscow, the city many are--

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Knapp's team was invited
to Moscow by government

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and military officials who were
willing to share decades worth

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:22.650 align:middle line:90%
of UFO files.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> General Igor Maltsev,
for seven years commander

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the entire Soviet
Air Defense System,

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.700 align:middle line:84%
recalls a UFO flap
over Moscow in 1990,

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.000 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of visual and radar
observations by military

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.840 align:middle line:90%
personnel.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Maltsev confirms
his standing order

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.580 align:middle line:90%
was don't fire on the UFO.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.850 align:middle line:84%
March 1991, radar at
the Leningrad Airport

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:48.780 align:middle line:84%
detects first one, then two,
then three unidentified objects

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.460 align:middle line:90%
hovering over a nuclear plant.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:55.260 align:middle line:84%
From a dead stop, the UFO zipped
away at 2,000 miles per hour.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Vallee was
one of few Westerners

00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:00.360 align:middle line:84%
to personally investigate
the case by meeting

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.885 align:middle line:90%
with Russian sources firsthand.

00:56:01.885 --> 00:56:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> An object hovered near
a nuclear power plant

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:08.300 align:middle line:84%
in [RUSSIAN] and a beam from
that object melted the asphalt

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.100 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The intention was maybe we
would be able to find out from

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:15.760 align:middle line:84%
the Russians more about what the
American government knows about

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.370 align:middle line:84%
UFOs than we will ever learn
from the American government

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Governor, are you
ready to take the oath?

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:26.190 align:middle line:10%
>> When a young, open-minded
president was sworn in, one

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:29.700 align:middle line:10%
of America's most highly
placed civilians saw a chance

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:33.060 align:middle line:10%
for a new government
transparency on the phenomenon.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> As a means of access
to people to the wonders

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.500 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Heir to the power
and influence of one

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of the world's wealthiest
families, Laurence Rockefeller,

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:46.500 align:middle line:84%
philanthropist and
conservationist,

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.400 align:middle line:84%
also had a passionate
interest in UFOs.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:58.260 align:middle line:10%
>> His idea was to approach
the president with a plea

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:03.660 align:middle line:10%
for making available the
data that the government had

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.190 align:middle line:10%
on the subject.

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:09.930 align:middle line:10%
>> The first inclination
by particularly people

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:13.170 align:middle line:10%
in government is you've
got to be kidding me.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.120 align:middle line:10%
You want me-- you
want me to risk

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:19.170 align:middle line:10%
my career by getting
deeply into the rabbit

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.390 align:middle line:10%
hole of talking about UFOs.

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
tremendous resistance.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:29.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Rockefeller met with
President Clinton's Science

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.370 align:middle line:10%
Advisor, Jack Gibbons, at the
White House and persuaded him

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:35.480 align:middle line:10%
to take action.

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Rockefeller was
then asked to pick

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:42.650 align:middle line:84%
a case that the White House
should attempt to declassify.

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:47.370 align:middle line:84%
He chose the 1947
Roswell incident, noting,

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:50.420 align:middle line:84%
quote, "Many are
convinced that Roswell

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:55.520 align:middle line:84%
marks the beginning of
government secrecy about UFOs."

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:59.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Jack had actually
gone to the Air Force,

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.750 align:middle line:10%
asked then Secretary Widnall,
who was the Secretary

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:07.610 align:middle line:10%
of the Air Force, to take a
look particularly at the records

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:09.620 align:middle line:10%
around Roswell, New Mexico.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:13.760 align:middle line:10%
>> "Dear Colonel Cavitt, the
General Accounting Office seeks

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:18.500 align:middle line:10%
to fully explain the claim that
the US government recovered

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.230 align:middle line:10%
an alien spacecraft
near Roswell,

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:26.840 align:middle line:10%
New Mexico in July 1947 and
since that time has covered up

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.410 align:middle line:10%
that fact."

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The Army Air Forces has
announced that a flying disk

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:34.650 align:middle line:84%
has been found and is now in
the possession of the Army.

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:40.940 align:middle line:10%
>> According to my dad,
there was a bad thunderstorm

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.350 align:middle line:10%
the night before.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:45.380 align:middle line:10%
And the next day, he
was out on the ranch

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:46.880 align:middle line:10%
and he found this debris.

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The disk landed at a
ranch at Corona, New Mexico.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.270 align:middle line:10%
And the rancher turned
it over to the Air Force.

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Roswell was then home to the
world's only nuclear air wing,

00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:02.030 align:middle line:84%
including the B-29 that had
dropped the first atomic bomb

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.880 align:middle line:90%
on Hiroshima.

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.290 align:middle line:10%
The base's Chief Intelligence
Officer, Major Jesse Marcel,

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:14.140 align:middle line:10%
was dispatched to the
ranch to investigate.

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.465 align:middle line:10%
>> We had to follow
the rancher out there.

00:59:16.465 --> 00:59:20.020 align:middle line:10%
With just verbal directions,
we never would have found it.

00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Marcel and another officer
were the first military

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.660 align:middle line:90%
to arrive at the crash site.

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:30.160 align:middle line:84%
They came upon an expanse of
unrecognizable debris strewn

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.670 align:middle line:84%
across an area the size of
a dozen football fields.

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.940 align:middle line:10%
>> There was so much of it.

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.730 align:middle line:10%
It was scattered over
such a vast area.

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:46.230 align:middle line:10%
We found a piece of
metal about a foot

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:49.903 align:middle line:10%
and 1/2 to 2 feet wide and
about 2 or 3 feet long.

00:59:49.903 --> 00:59:51.570 align:middle line:10%
Felt like you had
nothing in your hands.

00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:53.880 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't any
thicker than the foil

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.770 align:middle line:10%
out of a pack of cigarettes.

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The thing about
it that got me is

00:59:58.350 --> 00:59:59.970 align:middle line:90%
that you couldn't even bend it.

00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.500 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't even dent it.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Even with a sledgehammer,
would bounce off it.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Marcel was ordered
to immediately transport

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:12.110 align:middle line:84%
the strange wreckage to
Fort Worth Army Airfield.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:15.530 align:middle line:84%
There, Marcel was met by
the commanding general who

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:18.650 align:middle line:84%
told him to keep silent
in the face of what

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.290 align:middle line:90%
was becoming a media frenzy.

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>> They had a whole flock
of microphones there.

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:25.280 align:middle line:90%
They wanted me to--

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
they wanted some
comments from me,

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't at
liberty to do that.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Marcel was instead ordered
to pose with wood, foil,

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and rubber debris from a
conventional weather balloon.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> All I could do is
keep my mouth shut.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And General Ramey is the one
who told the newspapers what

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:50.030 align:middle line:90%
it was and to forget about it.

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It was nothing more than a
weather observation balloon.

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, which we
both knew differently.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Colonel Thomas DuBose, who
was also ordered to pose with

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
the fake debris, describes
how an iron curtain of secrecy

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:06.790 align:middle line:90%
slammed down.

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:09.190 align:middle line:10%
>> This is the highest
priority you can exhibit,

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:10.720 align:middle line:10%
and you will say nothing.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.530 align:middle line:10%
More than top secret, this
he said, it's beyond that.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:16.720 align:middle line:10%
This is story we're
going to tell the public.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.130 align:middle line:10%
It was a cover story,
the balloon part of it.

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:24.730 align:middle line:10%
In order, we don't have any
more inquiries about what

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:26.590 align:middle line:10%
we picked up on the desert.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Congressman Schiff, what got
you interested in this subject

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:30.520 align:middle line:10%
per se?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> I started receiving letters
a little over two years ago from

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.580 align:middle line:10%
constituents stating that they
believed the government was

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.560 align:middle line:10%
covering up what
happened at Roswell.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.110 align:middle line:10%
Many of them clearly
believed that it

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:43.900 align:middle line:10%
was in fact an
extraterrestrial crash.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.000 align:middle line:10%
The weather balloon
story never made sense

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.980 align:middle line:10%
because there was
clearly an undisputed,

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.130 align:middle line:10%
in my mind, extra military
attention to this matter,

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:54.550 align:middle line:10%
from extra security around the
crash scene to special handling

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.200 align:middle line:10%
of whatever the debris was.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.760 align:middle line:10%
That could fit a
classified project.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fit a
weather balloon.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.510 align:middle line:10%
>> In September 1994, the Air
Force issued its response,

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:10.340 align:middle line:10%
"The Roswell Report--

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.070 align:middle line:10%
Case Closed."

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force claimed
it was a secret project

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.730 align:middle line:84%
of weather balloons hung with
box kites and microphones

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:24.270 align:middle line:90%
to spy on Soviet nuclear tests.

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Please roll the video.

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>> There's the famous box kite
that became the famous flying

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
disk, the weather balloons
that were on the balloon train.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Same rubber balloon, same
foil box kite as the original

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
cover story, only many of
them strung together with

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.897 align:middle line:90%
microphones dangling beneath.

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the tin
foil, paper, rubber,

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and sticks that they recovered
in the desert near New Mexico

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
in 1947.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.150 align:middle line:10%
>> The Air Force,
nearly 50 years later,

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:59.850 align:middle line:10%
was basically telling
the same tale,

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:03.990 align:middle line:10%
that the top security personnel
of the world's only atomic

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:08.070 align:middle line:10%
bombing wing really had
mistaken this rubber, wood,

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:11.325 align:middle line:10%
and tin foil for a
crashed flying saucer.

01:03:11.325 --> 01:03:13.465 align:middle line:90%


01:03:13.465 --> 01:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Being an
intelligence officer,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I was familiar with just about
all materials used in aircraft

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.810 align:middle line:90%
and in our air travel.

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:22.740 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing like that.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It was not anything from this
Earth, that I'm quite sure of.

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:32.780 align:middle line:10%
>> My suspicion is that the
Roswell incident did happen

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:39.080 align:middle line:10%
and something maybe not from
our universe went down there.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And we should allow
the American people

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to make a judgment on what that
might have been by disclosing.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is probably
the most blatant case

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:55.460 align:middle line:10%
of overreaction to what
is national security.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.500 align:middle line:90%
The public has a right to know.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.220 align:middle line:90%


01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:03.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Rockefeller put together
a briefing document intended

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.190 align:middle line:10%
for world leaders with
a sobering observation.

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
"It is conceivable
that even the president

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
himself is not fully briefed
on matters classified

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:20.692 align:middle line:90%
as above top secret."

01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:22.900 align:middle line:10%
>> I did attempt to find
out if there were any secret

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.790 align:middle line:10%
government documents
that reveal things.

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:28.317 align:middle line:84%
And if there were, they
were concealed from me, too.

01:04:28.317 --> 01:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be-- I wouldn't
be the first president

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that underlings have lied to
or that career bureaucrats have

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:34.540 align:middle line:90%
waited out.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
But there may be some career
person sitting around somewhere

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
hiding these dark secrets
even from elected presidents.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But if so, they
successfully eluded me.

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm almost embarrassed to
tell you I did try to find out.

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:51.238 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.238 --> 01:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> 3 feet per
second contact now.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.820 align:middle line:90%
That was a beautiful one.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Apollo astronaut
Edgar Mitchell,

01:04:57.050 --> 01:05:01.720 align:middle line:10%
who had grown up around Roswell,
was an aerospace insider with

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.270 align:middle line:10%
deep Pentagon connections.

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
He became convinced there
were UFO secrets concealed

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.480 align:middle line:90%
from normal government channels.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if the accounts
are to be believed, yes,

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:17.810 align:middle line:10%
there have been ET visitation.

01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:20.510 align:middle line:90%
There have been crashed craft.

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
There have been material
and bodies recovered.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And there is some group
of people somewhere,

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that may or may not be
associated with government

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
at this point but
certainly were at one time,

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that have this knowledge.

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:54.010 align:middle line:90%


01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:57.800 align:middle line:10%
>> No one has proven
there's nothing to it.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.800 align:middle line:10%
No one's had the opportunity to
prove there's something to it.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:06.680 align:middle line:10%
And every passing day--

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.010 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2007, the most
powerful man in the Senate,

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:14.240 align:middle line:10%
majority leader Harry Reid,
persuaded two colleagues,

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Senators Ted Stevens
and Daniel Inouye,

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.040 align:middle line:10%
to secretly allocate millions
in Defense Department funds

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.580 align:middle line:10%
to investigate UFOs.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
The covert program operated
from the tail end of the Bush

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:32.450 align:middle line:84%
presidency through the
Obama administration

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:35.525 align:middle line:84%
and into Donald Trump's
first year in office.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:39.030 align:middle line:90%


01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
In December of 2017,
the lid blew off.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.640 align:middle line:90%


01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
At long last, the government was
admitting a modern day program

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to investigate UFOs and released
startling official evidence,

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:03.940 align:middle line:84%
including video tapes from the
cockpits of military aircraft.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the key authors
of the "Times" story

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.180 align:middle line:84%
was investigative journalist
and best-selling author Leslie

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Kane.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
She went to Washington to
meet with Luis Elizondo, who

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.320 align:middle line:84%
had just resigned
from his position

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.430 align:middle line:84%
as head of the secret
Pentagon UFO program.

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I was invited
to this meeting.

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:24.910 align:middle line:10%
They wanted me to
meet Mr. Elizondo

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.080 align:middle line:10%
to see what could happen.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Objects that
are moving so fast,

01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and yet we don't see an
ionization trail in the, air

01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:32.620 align:middle line:90%
and you don't hear a sonic boom.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.150 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Another one is--

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizondo's colleagues
took her aside to reveal some

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary documentation
related to the program.

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:44.902 align:middle line:84%
>> I wasn't allowed to
take anything with me.

01:07:44.902 --> 01:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the most
important evidence

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
that was shared with me
at the meeting regarding

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.707 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon itself
were the videos.

01:07:51.707 --> 01:07:54.646 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:54.646 --> 01:07:58.878 align:middle line:10%
>> Whoa, we got it.

01:07:58.878 --> 01:08:00.294 align:middle line:10%
>> What the fuck is that?

01:08:00.294 --> 01:08:02.215 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you box a moving target?

01:08:02.215 --> 01:08:04.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I knew this was breaking news
for the front page of "The New

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.092 align:middle line:10%
York Times."

01:08:06.092 --> 01:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a whole
fleet of them.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Look on the ASA.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.492 align:middle line:90%
>> My gosh.

01:08:12.492 --> 01:08:14.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at that thing.

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.170 align:middle line:10%
It's rotating.

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My co-author,
Ralph Blumenthal,

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and I set up a meeting with
Mark Mazzetti and said,

01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:24.040 align:middle line:90%
we have this explosive story.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Sat down with him
in the New York

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:27.093 align:middle line:84%
office of "The New
York Times," and we

01:08:27.093 --> 01:08:28.325 align:middle line:90%
brought in all the documents.

01:08:28.325 --> 01:08:29.200 align:middle line:90%
These are the videos.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Here's other documents that show
the existence of the program.

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And here's what they've
studied, and here's

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:36.399 align:middle line:84%
what they've learned, and
here's a letter from Harry

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Reid about the program.

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:42.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Elizondo's colleague,
the former Deputy Assistant

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:45.330 align:middle line:10%
Secretary of Defense
for Intelligence,

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:48.810 align:middle line:10%
Christopher Mellon, managed
to obtain the tapes from

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:49.770 align:middle line:10%
the Pentagon.

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:53.850 align:middle line:10%
And chose "The New York
Times" to break the story.

01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:57.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I received the videos,
the now famous videos,

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.109 align:middle line:10%
in the Pentagon parking lot from
a Defense Department official.

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:03.689 align:middle line:10%
I still have the originals
and the packaging.

01:09:03.689 --> 01:09:08.160 align:middle line:10%
This is a case where somebody
bent the rules a little bit,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.760 align:middle line:10%
and they did so for
the larger good.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.390 align:middle line:10%
And we're absolutely all
better off because of it.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:18.779 align:middle line:84%
In the end, I have to say
I was still extraordinarily

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
disappointed with
"The New York Times"

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:26.550 align:middle line:84%
because they focused on
this small AATIP program.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And the real story,
in my mind at least,

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
should have been
these things are real.

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:33.569 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.130 align:middle line:90%
This is happening now.

01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:38.550 align:middle line:90%


01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the Pentagon cases
reported by "The New York

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Times" was an encounter by naval
aircraft about 200 miles off

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
the coast of San
Diego, California.

01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:51.330 align:middle line:10%
>> 5,500 people that
were on the "Nimitz"

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:54.810 align:middle line:10%
in 2004 when this happened, and
I guarantee every single one

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:57.540 align:middle line:10%
of them knows that
this event happened.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.590 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole air wing.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:59.490 align:middle line:90%
That's Mount Fuji.

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:00.390 align:middle line:90%
That's Japan.

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Commander David Fravor was
leading a training exercise

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.920 align:middle line:84%
from the USS "Nimitz" carrier
strike group when he was

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.030 align:middle line:84%
abruptly ordered to investigate
an unknown target that had

01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:15.035 align:middle line:84%
appeared on one of the
ship's radar scopes.

01:10:15.035 --> 01:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
suspend the training.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.870 align:middle line:90%
We have real-world taskings.

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.720 align:middle line:90%
So we're like, OK, cool.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> He and another
F-18 Super Hornet,

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:27.070 align:middle line:84%
each carrying two airmen,
zoomed toward the coordinates.

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:30.483 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's myself and my WSO
and the other pilot and the WSO

01:10:30.483 --> 01:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
in the back seat
of that airplane,

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.630 align:middle line:90%
so there's four of us.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>> When they arrived, they first
saw what appeared to be a large

01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
object slightly below the
surface of the ocean with

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:46.510 align:middle line:84%
a strange oval-shaped craft
darting around in the air just

01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
above it.

01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If you picture a Tic Tac
that's about 40 feet long,

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:54.770 align:middle line:84%
round on both ends, no rivets,
no metal, smooth white,

01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:55.570 align:middle line:90%
it was white.

01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:58.702 align:middle line:84%
It was just smooth, no wings,
no propulsion, no windows.

01:10:58.702 --> 01:11:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter which way
it was pointing because it

01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:01.993 align:middle line:90%
was moving over the water.

01:11:01.993 --> 01:11:03.250 align:middle line:90%
It would go-- it never turned.

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It never changed its
longitudinal axis.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It went fore, aft, left, right.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It was just doing this.

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, I'm going
to go check that out.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.323 align:middle line:90%


01:11:16.323 --> 01:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you
just see it turn its body

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and go whoop and start
coming up at you.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You go-- that was
rather interesting.

01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:24.740 align:middle line:90%
We're just looking at it.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:25.620 align:middle line:90%
And we're doing this.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:26.957 align:middle line:90%
And we're looking at it.

01:11:26.957 --> 01:11:27.790 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at it.

01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:28.170 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at it.

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:29.962 align:middle line:84%
We go around all the
way around the outside

01:11:29.962 --> 01:11:31.360 align:middle line:90%
of the circle, 180 degrees.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, I know where he's going.

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.745 align:middle line:90%
So I'll just go over there.

01:11:33.745 --> 01:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%


01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:41.020 align:middle line:84%
This thing goes
poof, and it's gone.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
[SNAPS] that fast, gone.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:46.343 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You can think about what
we're saying, like, holy shit.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.920 align:middle line:90%
What the-- is that?

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a lot
of, dude, what the?

01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Did you guys see that?

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys see it?

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, it's gone.

01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:59.920 align:middle line:90%
We don't see shit.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing accelerates that fast.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.050 align:middle line:10%
You're talking-- you're
talking something that not only

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:08.680 align:middle line:10%
accelerated beyond
anything that we had seen,

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.840 align:middle line:10%
but it just was poof.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
The controller
comes up and says,

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're not going
to believe this,

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
but that thing is back
at your cap point.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Meaning the object
had instantly reappeared

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
at the precise
secret coordinates

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.770 align:middle line:84%
of the fleet's critical
aerial defense zone.

01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It obviously
had some awareness.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It knew where we were going.

01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:37.253 align:middle line:84%
It'll make the hair on the
back of your neck stand up.

01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
told my backs here,

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:39.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know about you.

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:40.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty weirded out.

01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:44.620 align:middle line:90%


01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>> More jets equipped with
the Navy's most advanced radar

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:53.180 align:middle line:84%
visual tracking systems
were scrambled, this time,

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
capturing the object on video.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> First thing he gets is
a little blip on the radar.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.340 align:middle line:90%
He puts his cursors over it.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And he tries to
grab a lock on it.

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Basically, when you
take a lock, you

01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
tell the radar look at that
location, and stare at it,

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and put all your
energy on that point.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, as soon as it
does it, the radar

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:17.545 align:middle line:84%
gets indications that it's
being jammed by the object it's

01:13:17.545 --> 01:13:18.345 align:middle line:90%
trying to lock.

01:13:18.345 --> 01:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%


01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
The infrared sees
differing temperatures.

01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So the Tic Tac is actually
hotter than the air around it.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be by much,
but it's going to appear white.

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:32.966 align:middle line:90%
They're driving straight at it.

01:13:32.966 --> 01:13:35.500 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of hovering there.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.005 align:middle line:84%
And it goes poof, and
it takes off the side.

01:13:38.005 --> 01:13:41.670 align:middle line:90%


01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:43.200 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know--

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I doubt that we have
developed that technology.

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:49.700 align:middle line:90%


01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:54.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I interviewed three of the
four aviators who were with

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:56.750 align:middle line:10%
Dave during that encounter.

01:13:56.750 --> 01:14:00.980 align:middle line:10%
And it was readily apparent
to everyone involved

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:05.120 align:middle line:10%
that vehicle had what they
call a dominant battlespace

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.380 align:middle line:10%
awareness.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It was in control of that
engagement from the outset.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
There was no question that
it completely outmatched

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.420 align:middle line:90%
our frontline fighters.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I served on the Special Access
Program Oversight Committee,

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
so I had access to all of the
Black Programs in those days.

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
We know perfectly
well there's nothing

01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
like that behind the scenes
or even on the drawing boards.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:32.240 align:middle line:90%


01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Senator Harry Reid, who
instigated the secret Pentagon

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
UFO program, confirmed what
nuclear launch officers have

01:14:40.190 --> 01:14:42.740 align:middle line:90%
been reporting for decades.

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.240 align:middle line:10%
>> There was more
than one up there.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> UFOs have interfered with
our country's most powerful

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:49.520 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.900 align:middle line:10%
>> If they had been called upon
by the president to launch,

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.220 align:middle line:10%
they couldn't have done it.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have anybody
in the Defense Department,

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon pull you aside,
bend your ear, and say,

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.840 align:middle line:90%
why are you doing this?

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.960 align:middle line:10%
>> They did everything they
could to stop the program from

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.890 align:middle line:10%
going forward.

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:12.320 align:middle line:10%
They gave the person
that came to me initially

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.580 align:middle line:10%
such a bad time.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
He's fortunate to have
hung on to his job

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
because people tried
to get rid of him

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
nothing to do with this.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
The Defense Intelligence
Agency was one of the worst.

01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
They dragged their
feet even though there

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:29.420 align:middle line:84%
was one of their
senior scientists

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
thought they should
look at this.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And remember, all
we're saying, nobody

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
has to agree that
why it's there,

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
but shouldn't we at least
be spending some money

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to study all of
these phenomenon?

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't we study the stuff?

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's all this was about
and why the federal government,

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
all these years, has covered up,
put brake pads on everything,

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%
stopped it.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.675 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very, very
bad for our country.

01:16:00.675 --> 01:16:06.620 align:middle line:90%


01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I interviewed Gordon Cooper,
Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper

01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:10.900 align:middle line:90%
back in the '90s.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:16.277 align:middle line:84%
Cooper said on camera that there
was a landed UFO at circa 1957

01:16:16.277 --> 01:16:17.360 align:middle line:90%
at Edwards Air Force Base.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
His camera crew captured
the filming of this object.

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And he presented this
to the higher ups.

01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:27.468 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, a career
jet came in from Washington.

01:16:27.468 --> 01:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
He handed the footage
over, which was good.

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:30.040 align:middle line:90%
He viewed it.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the last he saw of it.

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.335 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you know
where that footage

01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:35.725 align:middle line:84%
went of the flying saucer
that landed on the tarmac?

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It went to Washington.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.440 align:middle line:90%
That's all that I know.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you ever keep in
touch with anybody about it

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.830 align:middle line:10%
or discuss it?

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How would I keep in
touch with anybody about it?

01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no way
within the military

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
or within the government of
keeping track of something that

01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:49.420 align:middle line:90%
is classified.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you try to go
after stuff like this?

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:53.270 align:middle line:90%
We have.

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:54.590 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you saying that there's
some evidence that's still

01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:03.230 align:middle line:90%
hasn't seen the light of day?

01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm saying most of it
hasn't seen the light of day.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:11.200 align:middle line:90%


01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Astronaut Cooper had spoken
with the president at a cabinet

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:15.640 align:middle line:90%
meeting.

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.920 align:middle line:10%
He raised this with
Secretary Cohen.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.530 align:middle line:10%
And then Cohen's
office called me

01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:23.380 align:middle line:10%
and asked me to pursue
this and chase it down.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.830 align:middle line:90%


01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:31.370 align:middle line:10%
The Air Force colonel that I
spoke with got very frustrated.

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:32.835 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked
him what happened

01:17:32.835 --> 01:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to all of these
records, he said, well,

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
that was all cleaned up or
thrown out to save space,

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:39.170 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It sounded ludicrous, but
that's what he told me.

01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
If there is some
recovered debris,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.250 align:middle line:84%
say, it is so deeply
buried and squirreled away

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that it's outside of those
normal oversight processes,

01:17:58.690 --> 01:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%

a problem in this area.

at the atomic structure.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.820 align:middle line:10%
And at that point,
the atomic structure

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.410 align:middle line:10%

iron, nickel, or titanium,

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the ratio of isotopes
didn't make any sense.

talking about something that

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll just call it
an ultramaterial.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%

I intend to use the information

It does not mean that it was
necessarily made someplace

01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:17.080 align:middle line:10%
in outer space, just means that
it was manufactured especially

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.350 align:middle line:10%
for a particular purpose
that we don't understand,

01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:22.060 align:middle line:10%

looking at him, right?

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Then he was looking at me back.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
How could you just
keep on looking at him?

01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So I had to stop, and
I looked sideways.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But I was looking
straight into his eyes.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he never said anything.

01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
face is the eyes.

we don't know about.

01:26:54.060 --> 01:27:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they want people to
know that we're actually making

01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.540 align:middle line:90%
harm on this world.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And we mustn't get
too [much] technology.

01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't look
after the planet,

01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and all trees will just go
down, and there will be no air,

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and people will be dying.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this an idea
you have had before,

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:24.890 align:middle line:84%
or did this idea come to you
when you had this experience?

01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:27.490 align:middle line:90%


01:27:27.490 --> 01:27:30.970 align:middle line:90%

01:27:30.970 --> 01:27:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> For the first time
in nearly 20 years,

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.850 align:middle line:84%
the Ariel schoolchildren
gathered from the four corners

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of the world to talk to each
other about the experience they

01:27:40.450 --> 01:27:42.490 align:middle line:90%
shared that September morning.

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember something there.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>> One they all still
struggle to understand.

01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You know that
it's moving but you--

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I stand by what I saw.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:58.130 align:middle line:10%
There was no reason for
any of us to make that up.

01:27:58.130 --> 01:28:00.440 align:middle line:10%
>> I've not spoken
to anybody about it,

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.020 align:middle line:10%
not because I'm not proud of
it, but because I don't want

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:07.550 align:middle line:10%
the stigma.

01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:12.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's something that I've
had to deal with for 19 and 1/2

01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:14.925 align:middle line:10%
years.

01:28:14.925 --> 01:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to say
I felt like I knew it,

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that I didn't
have to be afraid of it.

01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:21.525 align:middle line:84%
>> They took us back to
the moment of contact.

01:28:21.525 --> 01:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> No, exactly how
I felt, exactly.

01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The details still
seared into memory.

01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I was with one of the
other girls and saying to her,

01:28:30.570 --> 01:28:33.010 align:middle line:90%
this is amazing.

01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:37.035 align:middle line:10%
>> We all were just
stopped in our tracks.

01:28:37.035 --> 01:28:42.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The little man appeared
on top of the actual craft.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And that moment for
me was very distinct

01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:47.530 align:middle line:84%
because I was like,
that's not human.

01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:50.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I was just completely
engulfed in these eyes.

01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The eyes, and in that moment,
however long it was because I

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
have no idea of the time
frame, It was just--

01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:57.270 align:middle line:90%
it was mesmerizing.

01:28:57.270 --> 01:29:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> There was no talking.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:08.310 align:middle line:84%
It's all just images in the
head, telepathic communication.

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> They were trying
to communicate,

01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:12.220 align:middle line:90%
trying to tell us something.

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It was something to do
with the environment.

01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I kept getting these
thoughts and ideas in my mind

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:17.970 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Technology is not helping.

01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:20.595 align:middle line:90%
Technology is bad.

01:29:20.595 --> 01:29:24.060 align:middle line:90%


01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going
down a wrong path,

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and we have to start recognizing
that what we're doing is

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
detrimental, and we
need to make changes.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what to do with that.

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.940 align:middle line:90%


01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.190 align:middle line:90%
They were reaching out to us.

01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It was as if they wanted
us to go with them.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.910 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, that was
kind of when I snapped

01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:51.600 align:middle line:90%
right out of the trance.

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as I broke contact,
all of those feelings,

01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:58.050 align:middle line:84%
technology, the bad, the
horribleness that was happening

01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and going around my
body at the time went.

01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:03.850 align:middle line:10%
>> It's making me a bit
anxious being back here.

01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:06.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I can feel it right now.

01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:08.520 align:middle line:10%
I was scared.

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.350 align:middle line:10%
>> They came running up here
in such a panic, screaming,

01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:12.150 align:middle line:10%
screaming.

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:13.710 align:middle line:10%
Aah, yeah, you know.

01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:18.010 align:middle line:10%
And a child can't make that up.

01:30:18.010 --> 01:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was there when they
were interviewing them and saw

01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:22.320 align:middle line:90%
the way they were.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.960 align:middle line:10%
It was just a huge big
mess, and muddle up,

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.910 align:middle line:10%
and just people everywhere, just
ask them questions straight off

01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:32.310 align:middle line:10%
without explaining to the
children what they were doing

01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:34.060 align:middle line:10%
and why they were doing it.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It was chaos in terms of
the media frenzy that was going

01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
on and us being so young and
not even being allowed time

01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:47.460 align:middle line:90%
to comprehend what we had seen.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Our teachers certainly
didn't believe us,

01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:50.460 align:middle line:84%
so that was a big
deal because we

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.110 align:middle line:84%
had to continue going
to school there.

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:56.090 align:middle line:90%


01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:59.480 align:middle line:84%

to the Ariel School to meet with

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Judy Bates, a teacher at the
time of the incident and now

01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:04.970 align:middle line:90%
the headmistress.

01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Something was weighing
on her that she

01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:10.220 align:middle line:90%
wanted to tell the children.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I said I
wanted to apologize.

01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:15.140 align:middle line:10%
I should have taken more
notice, but I didn't.

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.996 align:middle line:84%
I was more concerned
about me and not them

01:31:17.996 --> 01:31:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and what was going on in
my own sort of experience.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.690 align:middle line:90%

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.250 align:middle line:90%

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's about it.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.
