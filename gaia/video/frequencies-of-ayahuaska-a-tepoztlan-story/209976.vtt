But in my personal
life, the ceremony

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to trust
a lot more in what's

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.305 align:middle line:84%
coming, because sometimes
you're on this path for a while

00:21:31.305 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that you want to go back
to the drawing board

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and just make sure that there's
a balance between service

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and the balance between
checking in with yourself again

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you're on the path
you want to be on, because you

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:90%
do have a choice still.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So aside from crystallizing,
it was such a healing ceremony.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of tears, a lot
of cleaning, you know?

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I was just
sitting calm the whole time.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> People sometimes come
and they want to see visions

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and they want that the medicine
transform and heal immediately.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is a lot of expectation,
and expectations can almost

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
be a frustration.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
best recommendation

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
to come in the ceremony
is come in the moment

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.635 align:middle line:90%
that you really, really need it.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Someone told me a wonderful
parable about a horse.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
A man's riding a
horse in the dark,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and they're traveling far hills.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And he can't see anything
because it's dark,

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:90%
but the horse is trudging.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.835 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at the
horse and he's like, man,

00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:00.103 align:middle line:90%
how do you know the way?

00:23:00.103 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:84%
How do you know
where we're going?

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.812 align:middle line:84%
And the horse was like, I
don't look at the whole road.

00:23:03.812 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I just follow my next step.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Follow that next small
step, and you'll never--

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:90%
it's important to take pauses.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:10%
You'll never regret
trusting your gut

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:10%
and following that
right next step.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
When you make mistakes, don't
beat yourself up about them.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself the same grace
you would give a newborn baby.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:90%
This time, just try different.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But take pauses because

frequency or your
current programming

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:84%
will want to go to what
it's used to doing sort of.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:47.187 align:middle line:84%
So you thrive when you switch
the program a little bit.
