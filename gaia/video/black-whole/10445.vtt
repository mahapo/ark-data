00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>What unifies everything
and everyone everywhere?

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
This question has baffled
physicists and scholars

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:90%
for centuries.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Nobel Prize winner
Albert Einstein

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
came up with the most
respected physics equations.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But his dream of finding
the unified solution

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:90%
eluded even him.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Where should one
look for the answer

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:90%
to this universal puzzle?

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:90%
To the past?

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:90%
The future?

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The ends of the
cosmos or beyond?

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Or inward?

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Is the answer inside
a particle, a proton?

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Does our consciousness
affect the nature of reality?

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe clues have
been left for us

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
centuries, encrypted

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.161 align:middle line:90%
in sacred icons and symbols.

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Who among us can
unravel the mysteries?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Einstein was a technical
assistant at the patent office

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
when, in his spare
time, he cranked out

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
some of the most remarkable
theories, theories that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:84%
remain the crux of
classical physics today.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Einstein once said,
"any intelligent fool

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
could make things
bigger and more complex.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It takes a touch of genius
and a lot of courage

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to move in the
opposite direction."

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:84%
You expect a physics
mastermind to be holed up

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
in a big stone building with
ivy crawling up the walls, not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
on the ski slopes
of British Columbia

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
or swimming with the dolphins
off the big island of Hawaii,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
scuba diving and exploring the
Bimini wall near the Bahamas,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
or scaling the rest
of the physical world

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.065 align:middle line:90%
literally and mathematically.

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Nassim Haramein was born in
Geneva, Switzerland in 1962.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Like many other savants,
this imaginative child

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
frustrated teachers to the
point he was ostracized.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Few around him knew
of the equations,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
mathematical quandaries
and probabilities

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
that consumed his mind.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
As a young adult, Haramein
spent months living alone

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
in a van in California
tackling these nagging concepts

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
until he met believers
who supported his efforts.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>This is our entrance
to the laboratory.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Haramein struggled
for the next 25 years,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:84%
working alone and with
world-renowned physicist

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Rauscher,
testing and finally

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
potentially solving
Einstein's dream.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
This lifetime of
decoding started in 1972,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
when a teacher
sparked Haramein's

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:90%
faithful inner journey.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>This all kind of started
when I was about 10 years old

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and I got in my
first geometry class.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
It was an exciting time,
because the teacher

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
went to the blackboard and
made a little dot and said,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
today we're going to
learn about dimensions.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And when he said dimensions,
I got all excited.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought,
oh, he's going

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
to talk about all these
world I live in my mind

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
things I'm experiencing.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, that's
the first adult that's

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about that.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And so I got really excited.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I got really,
really, really disappointed.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Because after he put the little
dot on the blackboard he said,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:90%
the dot is dimension zero.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't exist.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, I think
I'm going to fail this class.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I could see
the dot from all way

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:90%
in the back of the class.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So if I could see it, how
is it that it didn't exist?

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Then he did something
even more miraculous.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:84%
He put a bunch of dots
together to make a line,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
called it dimension 1, and
said that didn't exist, either,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
because it still
didn't have volume.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Then he put four lines
together, made a plane,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.695 align:middle line:84%
called it dimension 2,
said that's a dimension

00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that our comic
strip books live in.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
doesn't exist, either,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because it still
doesn't enclose volume.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It's flat.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The teacher then did
something remarkable.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:10%
He took six of these
non-existing planes,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:10%
put them together into a cube,
and said now the planes enclose

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:10%
volume.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.820 align:middle line:10%
This is the dimension 3.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:10%
And that's the one you exist in.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wait.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:90%
How's that possible?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you have a
million non-existing planes.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
If you put them together, you
still don't have existence.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:90%
This didn't work for me.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I thought if the dot doesn't
exist, the line doesn't exist,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
the plane doesn't exist,
you don't have existence.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I found
out many other people

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
found the same problem
when they were young

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and were taught these axioms.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:10%
One of them was a famous
geometrist, Buckminster Fuller.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
these fundamental axioms

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
about geometry is some of what
most of our math and physics

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
is based on.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Our physics and advanced
physics, Einstein field

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:84%
equations, quantum theory, all
this is based on flat space.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And if these axioms, if this
fundamental concept is not

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
correct, then most
likely what we're

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
going to end up with when we
run all these physics and all

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
these mathematics to
understand our world

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a little tweak.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be quite correct.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know all this at
the time, at the age of 10.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, I wanted
to understand it.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find a new solution.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I had a long bus ride
going home, and I thought,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I've got to figure this out.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I was in the bus,
and I was thinking

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get out of the
bus until I got this figured.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know that many
philosophers and scientists

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:10%
had raveled with this problem.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:90%
I closed my eyes in the bus.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And in mind's eye,
I visualized myself

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:90%
seeing the bus from above.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And I rose further and further.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, the bus
started to look like a dot.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
I rose further.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And the country I was in
started to look like a dot.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And I rose further,
and I saw the Earth

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:90%
starting to look like a dot.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.799 align:middle line:84%
And I rose further, and
I saw the solar system

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:90%
looking like a dot.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I rose further, and I saw
the galaxy looking like a dot.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my god.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:90%
It's dots all the way up.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I flew back
into the galaxy,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:84%
flew back into the Earth,
and found the bus I was in,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.305 align:middle line:84%
and opened my eyes,
and looked at my hand.

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.305 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what's in my hand.

00:07:43.305 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And I closed my eyes again
and I flew into my hand.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, it's made
out of millions of dots, cells.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I flew onto the
surface of one of those cells.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
And I looked around.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
It was made out of millions
of smaller dots that

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:90%
looked like stars in the sky.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I flew into one of those
dots and looked in the middle.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, there was
another teeny, weeny dot

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of those atoms.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%
It's dots all way down.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:90%
And I-- a light went on.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
The way to solve the
dimensional problem is

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
to reverse the axiom completely
and say the only thing that

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:90%
exists is the dot.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:84%
Within the dot is infinite
amount of division,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:90%
infinite amount of information.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, everything
is made out of dots.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
And the dots are
arranged differently.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And that makes up
our whole world.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I opened my eyes, and I looked
at all the people in the bus.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, they're
all made out of dots.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And I could kind of
see the infinite dots

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:90%
of their existence.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I got really excited.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But then I started to
realize through a few other

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:90%
experiences that, wait a minute.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:08.416 align:middle line:84%
If it's infinite--
divisions-- if infinite,

00:09:08.416 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
how is it that we
get finite structure?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we get
a finite boundary?

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we have finite
systems with, like, infinities?

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.637 align:middle line:84%
>>Haramein didn't
know it at the time,

00:09:21.637 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
but he was grappling
with one of the biggest

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:90%
chasms in current physics.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's theory of
general relativity

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:84%
covers the cosmic scales
and the relationship

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
between gravity,
time, and space.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
It predicts continuum to an
infinite point of singularity,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:90%
or a black hole.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Quantum theory covers the
smallest units in the universe

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and predicts finite
and linear boundaries.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:90%
The two theories are at odds.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But Haramein believes both
viewpoints are interconnected,

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
because everything big is
made up of something small.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>In general, we could define
our society in two ways.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
We've got people that have a
tendency to be very spiritual,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and these people tend to
think in terms of infinities,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
that infinite potential,
and all this stuff.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
we have scientific people

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that tend to think in finite
systems, closed systems that

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:90%
have very defined boundaries.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And the two don't
necessarily agree.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, at this point,
this has to come together.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And in a very simple way, I'm
going to show you geometrically

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that infinities
and finite system

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
are actually complimentary.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
If we take the
boundary of a circle,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and we define that as
our finite space-- now

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:90%
that circle could be a sphere.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And we divide that
circle so that a triangle

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:84%
is formed in it, an equilateral
triangle in this case.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Now, the universe is polarized.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
universe seems to spin.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:90%
So spin produce polarity.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So we would have a reverse
triangle at the same time.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:10%
As soon as we do this, now
we've created a new boundary

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:10%
condition at the next fractal
level down, the next iteration

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:10%
down.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, notice that these
new boundaries all

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
are centered around a
very specific center.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:10%
That is, each of the
boundaries defines

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:10%
a very specific
structure in spacetime,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:10%
a very specific
coordinate in spacetime.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:10%
And so each of the
boundaries could

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:10%
be defined as a very
specific set of information.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, I can continue
to divide this space

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:10%
to produce new
boundary conditions.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, I've got another
iteration down

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:10%
and another set of information.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.770 align:middle line:10%
Now, I can continue to do
this and create new boundaries

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:10%
again.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:10%
And at this point,
you can imagine

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:10%
that if I gave this
to my computer,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:10%
it could zoom in,
bring it back up,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:10%
continue to divide the space.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Zoom in, bring it back up,
continue to divide the space.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And it could do
this to infinity.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
However, I would
never ever, ever, ever

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
exceed that first boundary
I've produced for myself.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So here, I have
embedded infinite amount

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:84%
of divisions, infinite
amount of information,

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
within the confine
of a finite space.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So in very simple
terms here, I've

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
shown to you that infinities
and finite structures

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:90%
are complimentary.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
That within the confines of what
appears to be a finite space

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:84%
can be embedded infinite
amount of information.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And if this is true,
this simple concept

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
could change all of our
concepts of physics,

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
including our concepts of our
relationship to the universe.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:90%
So why is that true?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Think of yourself
as made of cells

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:90%
that are made out of atoms.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's about
100 trillion cells

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
in your body and billions
of atoms per cells.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that all these
cells and all these atoms

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
can be further divided into
subatomic particles that

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:84%
can be divided into
sub-subatomic particles

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and so on towards infinity.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that
you actually, even

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:84%
in your physical body, have
a function of infinity.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
That is, you have
an infinite nature

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
within the confine of what
you call the physical world.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to even
have a spiritual concept

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:90%
of your infinite nature.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the way
you're made if this is true.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:26.346 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>This complimentary
fractal condition

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
could change the
fundamentals of physics.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Quantum theorists
adhere to a concept

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
called the God Particle.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
If we look hard
enough, they believe,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.375 align:middle line:84%
we'll discover the
smallest division

00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:90%
that the universe creates.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's another way
to approach it.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>At first, when we had
our first microscopes,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
when we saw cells, we
thought, oh my god.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are so small,
they got to be

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:84%
the smallest thing
the universe does.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we found that those
cells were made out of atoms.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And the atoms are so
small, we thought, oh.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Those are got to be
the God Particle.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Those are the smallest
thing the universe does.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we found
that those atoms

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
have nuclei in the
middle, protons, neutrons.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And those are teeny,
weeny, weeny particles

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
size of the atom.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The universe goes all the
way down to that size,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:24.994 align:middle line:90%
and then stops.

00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:90%
And it says, OK.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:90%
That's small enough.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything smaller.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:84%
However, then we found
quarks, and so on.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
we're building

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
accelerators that are enormous,
an extraordinary device that

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
accelerates particles at
faster and faster rates

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to get smaller and
smaller particles,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
thinking every time
that we're going

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
to find this fundamental
particle that

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:90%
can no longer be divided.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
However, every time
some physicist somewhere

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
writes a new equation
saying, oh, maybe there's

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
another energy level, da,
da, da, da, da, and then

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
next thing you know, we're
building a larger accelerator

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:90%
to try to find it.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
looking for things

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that are billions of times
smaller than an atom.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
But based on this concept
that we've just learned about,

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
we would know that this
can be done to infinity,

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can always get a
smaller and smaller particle

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
if you could get larger
and larger accelerator.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.525 align:middle line:84%
So what is this really
telling us about the universe?

00:16:35.525 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that a more
worthy exploration

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:84%
would be to stop looking
for a fundamental particle

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and start looking for
a fundamental pattern

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:90%
of division.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if we could find the
pattern in which the universe

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
divides, then we would
have the key to creation.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:90%
And that could be really useful.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
My first sponsors wanted me to
spend a lot of time interacting

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:84%
with other physicists to try
to get some support from them,

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and as well discuss ideas, and
see where my theory related

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:90%
to the mainstream, and so on.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, he dragged me
to a bunch of different physics

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:90%
conference.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't so excited.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I already had
a bunch of run-ins

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
with the mainstream
scientific community.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And I was a little worried.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you know, I got
into this private conference

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:90%
at Georgia Tech.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And we were discussing
very advanced physics,

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:90%
string theory.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
There was equations
everywhere and so on.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of irritating
people a little bit,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
because I kept on asking
fundamental questions.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The only book I had brought
was this book, "Gravitation."

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
"Gravitation" is the Bible
of relativistic equations.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's written by giants
of physics, Wheeler, Thorne,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:90%
and Misner.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And it has all
the equations that

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
describes relativistic
equations and curvature of space

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:90%
and gravitation.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.309 align:middle line:84%
And it's called "Gravitation"
because it's pretty thick.

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you pick it
up, you know everything

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:90%
you need to know about gravity.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, at one point,
I stopped the conference,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and I asked-- I
said, wait a minute.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:90%
I got to understand something.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I opened "Gravitation"
to page 719,

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and I said, if I
understand well,

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
this is our current
model of the universe.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a balloon
that's being inflated

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:90%
that has pennies glued to it.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And the pennies are
representative of galaxies.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And as the balloon
inflates, the pennies

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
move away from each
other, representing

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:90%
the expansion of our universe.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're all looking
at me, going yes.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:90%
This is the current model.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
These are fundamental
principles.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
What I want to know--
and I've looked

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
in many, many different
physics books.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I read all these equations,
worked out all this stuff.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
What I'm not understanding,
and you gentlemens

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
might be able to point
this equation to me,

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found anywhere where
it explains who's this guy.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And the whole room
became really quiet.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I will always remember
one of the students

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
was drinking coffee, and he
kind of coughed a little bit

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:90%
when I said that.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
He thought maybe I'd say
the word God in the physics

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:90%
department.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Look at it this way.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:84%
When the balloon expands,
the lungs contract.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So for every action, there's an
equal and opposite reaction--

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
some of the first
laws of physics.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:84%
In our current model, the
universe is expanding,

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:84%
but nothing is contracting
to make it expand.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that
the balloon can

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
expand if you're not
compressing air into it.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was a crucial moment.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
It had come from earlier
experiences when I was young,

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
where I realized that
there's an external world

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:90%
to my experience.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But as well, is an internal
world to my experience.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought maybe
the boundary conditions

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
of the division of
the universe are

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
the result of the relationship
between the outside world

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and the inside world.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And that the two are
like colliding wave,

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
like standing wave that
produce boundaries.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, if I was
to point at something that

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
connected all things,
what would that be?

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
If I could choose just one
thing that connects everything,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I came to
conclude the only thing that's

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, that connects
all things, is space.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Space is everywhere: between
galaxies, between stars,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
between planets, between
cells, between atoms.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And even the atomic structure
is made out of 99.99999% space.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So the reality we live
in is mostly space.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything you see,
all the material world

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that you think is so solid,
is actually mostly space.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
What you're experiencing
as your reality,

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
what you call the
material world,

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually 0.0000001 of
a percent of what's there.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we spend most of our time
paying attention to that part

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and forget to look at the space.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
For me, earlier
on, it was crucial

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that maybe it's the space
we should be looking at.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we should pay
attention to the 99.9999999%.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe objects don't
define the space,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:90%
but space defines the objects.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that was true,
and if the vacuum,

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
if the space was
connecting all things,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
since all things
radiate in the space,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and if the space is the
source of all things,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
then that space
could not be empty.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
What we call the vacuum, what
we call so-called empty space,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:90%
could not be empty.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:90%
It had to be full.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And it had to be infinitely
full-- very, very dense

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:90%
in any case.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Does current quantum
field theory account

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:90%
for this density?

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Haramein turned again to
the book of "Gravitation,"

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
where he was surprised to
find supporting evidence.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "present-day quantum
field theory gets rid

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
by a renormalization process of
an energy density in the vacuum

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.435 align:middle line:84%
that would formally be
infinite if not removed by this

00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:90%
renormalization."

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>So in current
quantum field theory,

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
it is necessary for
the vacuum to have

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.770 align:middle line:84%
a very, very high
density level in order

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:54.250 align:middle line:84%
for us to be able to run
our equation and account

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
for everything that's going
on at the atomic level.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:84%
That was a confirmation
point for what I was already

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:84%
thinking about, that
the vacuum is not empty,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that space is actually
a fluctuation that

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
may be actually the
source of our reality.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:90%
But what is renormalization?

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's two kinds
of infinities in physics.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinitely
small number.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:84%
In general, a
theory that comes up

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
with an infinitely small number,
the number can be discarded.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not very important, because
it's a very, very small number.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
However, there's another thing
that creeps up in physics.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, it's
called nasty infinities.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is an
infinitely large number.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
When an equation gives you
an infinitely large number,

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.220 align:middle line:84%
you can't just say I'm
going to ignore that.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So what is done usually,
either than being

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
said that the theory may be
breaking down at that level,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:84%
is that that number
is renormalized.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So usually what's used
is a fundamental constant

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:90%
to cut the number.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:84%
In this case, what was used
was the Planck's distance.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:84%
The Planck's distance
is supposedly

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the smallest thing
the universe does.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.610 align:middle line:84%
You could think of it
in a really simple term

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
as the time or the
distance it takes a photon

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:90%
to go across itself.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the smallest
wavelength the universe

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be able to do.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Do I think that the
Planck's distance

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:84%
is the smallest thing
the universe does?

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
Planck's distance

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
is a boundary condition that
is a fundamental boundary

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in relationship
to our experience.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there's
further definition,

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
there's further structure
below the Planck's distance.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:84%
In any case, using the
Planck's distance, which

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
is 1.616 multiplied
by 10 to minus 33--

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
extremely small, billions of
times smaller than an atom--

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:90%
they renormalized the vacuum.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
What they did is they took
a centimeter cube of space.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said how many of
these Planck's distances

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:84%
can we fit in,
can we squeeze in,

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:90%
into a centimeter cube of space?

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, we'll
have a finite number

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:90%
for the density of the vacuum.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Basically, how much fluctuation
of Planck's distances

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:84%
is there in a centimeter
cube of space?

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So they stacked little
Planck's distances

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:84%
full into a centimeter
cube of space.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Each one have a very specific
mass, 10 to the minus 5 grams.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And they added it all up to
get a fundamental density.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
The result was still
extremely large.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
The result is 10 to the 93
grams per centimeter cubed.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:90%
That is an enormous number.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.110 align:middle line:84%
You might have noticed in your
bank account, every time you

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:84%
add a zero, it
makes a big change.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you have 50 some
zeroes, and you keep adding.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
At 93 zeroes, you've got
the density of the vacuum.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, to give you an idea
of how dense is that,

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
imagine that you took all of the
stars we see in the universe.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:90%
There's billions of galaxies.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
They have billions
of stars in them.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stars are even
much larger than our sun.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.430 align:middle line:10%
And we took them all,
and we squished them

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:10%
all into a centimeter
cube of space

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:10%
with this huge trash
compactor or something.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:10%
You still wouldn't have the
energy density of the vacuum.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:10%
Because the universe
is approximately 10

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:10%
to the 55th gram.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:10%
So 10 to the 55th gram squeezed
into a centimeter cube of space

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:10%
is still some 39
orders of magnitude

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:10%
smaller than the
structure of the vacuum,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.490 align:middle line:10%
the density of the vacuum.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So to think of empty space
as empty is incorrect.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Space is full.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It's full of these fluctuations.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:84%
It's full of this energy
density that is actually,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:84%
according to what I found,
the source of all of reality.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The negative space is what
produces our material world.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Based on this, I started
to think about it

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
in terms of division
of this vacuum density.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I started to think
of our reality

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:84%
not as object in the space,
but as division of the space.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I started to think maybe we
could start to find patterns

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:90%
in the division of the space.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Rauscher and
I published a paper.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:10%
And this paper
described a scaling law.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:10%
The scaling law is simple.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:84%
On one side, we
have energy density.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And on the other,
we have a radius.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So the graph represents
energy in terms

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
of Hertz in one direction
and the radius in the other.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And we started to plot
all of the objects we

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:90%
see in the universe.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.850 align:middle line:84%
We started with the
universe itself.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.130 align:middle line:90%
We ran the equations.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And we took the data
that's available

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
to approximate the
radius of our universe.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we approximated
its energy levels,

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and we plotted the
first data point.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
When you look at our universe,
its size, and the amount

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:84%
of material in it, you find
that actually our universe

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:84%
obeys the condition
of a black hole.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Our universe is too dense for
light to actually escape it.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:84%
If we were to shine a laser
in our universe right now,

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
it would get bent a little bit
by our local star, our sun.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Then it would eventually
get to another star

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:90%
and get bent a little bit more.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And it would get to
another star and get bent

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
by that gravitational
field, and get bent

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:84%
by gravitational fields
of galaxy and all this.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And because there's
so much mass, there's

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:84%
so much matter in our universe,
in its radius, in a closed

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.220 align:middle line:84%
universe, actually light would
not be able to escape it.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:90%
It would come back onto itself.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, our universe can
be considered as a black hole.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Technically, it
obeys that condition.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Did you know you live in
a black hole universe?

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>The universe, with its
black hole condition,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
was the first data
point Haramein charted.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:84%
He next added galactic
centers and stars.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
They lined up in a
linear progression

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
with the universe,
an amazing result.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:84%
If the vacuum is the
source of the division,

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.810 align:middle line:84%
then it divides in very
specific relationships.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
The next step was to see
if the pattern continued

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:84%
on the other end of
the physics scale.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, we went from stars all
the way down to atoms, right

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:84%
across the quantum world
from relativistic equation

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.890 align:middle line:90%
to the quantum world.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And we plotted the energy level
of an atom and its radius.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the data
point lined up again.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a huge jump.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we went
all the way down

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to the Planck's
distance singularity.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And that lined up as well.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:84%
All the way from universe, which
is immense, to a teeny point

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:84%
billions and billions
and billions of times

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:84%
smaller than an
atom, and all this,

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:84%
all the data points in between
lining up so very closely

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:90%
to a perfect linear progression.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Remarkable-- showing
that there is

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:90%
structure, that there is order,

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that the vacuum is dividing in
very specific relationships.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.950 align:middle line:10%
And when we start to
look at the relationship

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:13.750 align:middle line:10%
between the divisions
of the data points,

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:10%
we found that the relationships
were very close to phi ratios.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.720 align:middle line:10%
The phi ratio is found
everywhere in nature.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:84%
When you look at your hand,
the end of your finger

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:84%
is 1.618, which is
the phi ratio, smaller

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
than the second
part of your finger.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And the second part is 1.618
smaller than the third part.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And your hand relative
to your forearm.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Your arms relative to
your body, and so on.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.180 align:middle line:10%
Those Fibonacci
sequence, or phi ratios,

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:10%
are found everywhere in
nature, is in plants,

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:10%
in flowers, the branches
of a tree, the roots

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:59.550 align:middle line:10%
of a tree, the nervous system of
your body, all of the divisions

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:10%
that produces all
of the arteries

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.970 align:middle line:10%
and the veins of your
body and so on-- all phi

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.134 align:middle line:10%
ratios, all Fibonacci series.

00:34:08.134 --> 00:34:10.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>The phi ratio is evident even
beyond where our eyes can see.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
The most recent
discovery confirmed

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:84%
that the phi ratio exists
even at the atomic level.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Researchers in Germany
observe that a chain of atoms

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
acts like a nano scale
musical instrument,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
whereby the phi
ratio seems to be

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.485 align:middle line:84%
the preferred division
of the musical notes.

00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>So it was remarkable to
find it on such a huge scale.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:10%
It indicated that the
scaling law was correct,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:48.040 align:middle line:10%
that the structure is evident
and it is present even

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:10%
on enormous scale.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:84%
Where is the
structure coming from?

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Most likely, from the
structure of the vacuum

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.730 align:middle line:84%
itself, the division
of the vacuum.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
It was clear to
me that the vacuum

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:90%
must have fundamental structure.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.150 align:middle line:84%
There was another data point
that was very interesting.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:10%
When you take the biological
resolution, the microtubules,

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:10%
which are small
entities that makes up

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:10%
the structure of cells,
they are much, much,

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.300 align:middle line:10%
much larger than that atoms.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But they oscillate at the very
high rate, 10 to the 11 to 10

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.930 align:middle line:90%
to the 14 Hertz.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So we plotted the microtubules
on our scaling law.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
amazingly, it almost

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.160 align:middle line:84%
landed on the linear
progression perfectly

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and divided the scale
almost in the middle,

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.200 align:middle line:84%
between the extremely large
and the extremely small.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
There was this
biological entity that

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:84%
makes up the
biological world, as

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:03.720 align:middle line:84%
if biology, as if
your structure,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:84%
is the boundary condition that
divides the extremely large

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.750 align:middle line:90%
to the extremely small.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.155 align:middle line:90%
You are the event horizon.

00:36:14.155 --> 00:36:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It started to make sense that
all this organization would

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.480 align:middle line:84%
include the
biological structure.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when we see our
biological world, when

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.760 align:middle line:84%
we see our environment,
when we see our biosphere,

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:90%
it's highly organized.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And these phi ratios
are found everywhere.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.130 align:middle line:84%
There was another
data point that

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:84%
was interesting in
the scaling law.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.490 align:middle line:84%
The atomic level is in
between the universal size

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:90%
and the Planck's distance.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we saw,
the universal size

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:90%
can be considered a black hole.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It obeys the
Schwarzschild condition.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Planck's distance obeys
the Schwarzschild condition.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So having the atom right there
on that linear progression

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.050 align:middle line:84%
started to indicate that
the atom may be a black hole

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.580 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:59.910 align:middle line:84%
As we saw earlier, the
division of the space

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.530 align:middle line:90%
can be done to infinity.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:06.005 align:middle line:84%
If an atom has subatomic
particles that are made out

00:38:06.005 --> 00:38:08.155 align:middle line:84%
of sub-subatomic particles
that are made out

00:38:08.155 --> 00:38:10.300 align:middle line:84%
of sub-sub-subatomic
particles and so

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:84%
on to infinity, and
each one has a mass,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:84%
then there's infinite mass
at the center about of atoms.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And to me, very
early, I concluded

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:90%
they must be mini black holes.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:28.580 align:middle line:84%
From this conclusion,
I extrapolated

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that there must be a black hole
at the center of all galaxies.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I said that very early,
almost 17 years ago.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:84%
However, at the time,
there was not much data

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.460 align:middle line:84%
about the center of
galaxies, so many physicists

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.100 align:middle line:90%
thought this was improbable.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we got
more and more data

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.420 align:middle line:90%
about the center of galaxies.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
there is a black hole

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:84%
at the center of what seems
to be every galaxy we observe.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So that confirmed that I
was on the right track.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But how is the
atom a black hole?

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Is our current physics say that?

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.600 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So I had to start
looking at how we wrote

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.070 align:middle line:84%
our physics for the
atomic level and how

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
they could be written
in a different way.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Could we approach the
atom as a mini black hole?

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, this
is how I solved it.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And it is the crux of
the unification theory

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:90%
that I'm bringing forward.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can describe
the atom as a mini black hole,

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
then we can describe
the atomic world

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.150 align:middle line:90%
with Einstein field equations.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.944 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at the
atom in detail.

00:39:43.944 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:84%
What I did is I
said, wait a minute.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.140 align:middle line:84%
We have a density
of the vacuum of 10

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to the 93 grams per
centimeter cubed.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that considered when
we look at the atom?

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in current physics,
although that number

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
is used all the time
in quantum theory

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to make our
equations work, it is

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:12.520 align:middle line:84%
assumed that the
vacuum density does not

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:90%
have any physical meaning.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact
now, from experiments,

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that actually the vacuum density
can be measured in laboratory

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and has mechanical effects.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So if it has mechanical
effects, it obviously

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:35.670 align:middle line:84%
has meaning in our
material world.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I wondered how
much a vacuum would

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:44.580 align:middle line:84%
be present inside the
nuclei of an atom.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Would that energy
be enough to make

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the nuclei of an
atom a black hole?

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at the proton,
which is at the nuclei.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started to extrapolate
how much vacuum would the proton

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.470 align:middle line:84%
volume still contain,
knowing that there's

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.860 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 93 grams
per centimeter cubed

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.800 align:middle line:90%
in a centimeter cube of space.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.090 align:middle line:84%
How much of that
vacuum would still

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.390 align:middle line:84%
be present in the
volume of a proton?

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I calculated the
volume of a proton

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and found that there is still
10 to the 55th grams in a proton

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:30.830 align:middle line:90%
volume.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.610 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 55th grams
of vacuum energy

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is still present
in a proton volume.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Where did we see that number?

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 55th gram is
the mass of the universe.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:10%
There is the mass of the
universe present in vacuum

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:10%
fluctuation, in vacuum
density, in the volume

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:10%
of a proton, which is a
very, very small entity.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
This confirmed something
fundamental to me.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It confirmed that
the vacuum is truly

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the thing that
connects all things.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.720 align:middle line:84%
It showed that
everything is entangled

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.720 align:middle line:90%
and everything is one.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And it showed it mathematically.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.040 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to say
everything's one, which

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:84%
is some things you find people
saying in spiritual world.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.030 align:middle line:84%
However, this
actually proves it.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So is 10 to the 55th grams
enough to make the proton

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.210 align:middle line:90%
a black hole?

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Since 10 to the 55th
grams is enough to make

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the whole universe a
black hole, when that's

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:84%
present in a small volume of a
proton, it's more than enough.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I calculated how much
of that is actually

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.280 align:middle line:84%
necessary to make the
proton a black hole.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:10%
And I found that it's
only necessary for 10

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:15.980 align:middle line:10%
to the minus 39 percent, a
very small number, teeny,

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.285 align:middle line:10%
teeny number, a
decimal with 39 zeroes,

00:43:19.285 --> 00:43:25.250 align:middle line:10%
right, to make the
proton a black hole.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:28.440 align:middle line:84%
A very small amount
of the vacuum

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.920 align:middle line:84%
can become coherent and
be converted to mass

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to make the proton a black hole.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.340 align:middle line:90%
It was very amazing.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Because when we did
this, at the same time,

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
we calculated many things
for such a black hole proton.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that it gives
us all the correct answers

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.160 align:middle line:90%
to describe the atomic level.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And from the experiments
that are done in laboratory

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and the results we
get in the laboratory,

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.480 align:middle line:84%
all the correct answers
were coming out.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But our proton was much heavier
than the standard proton.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:90%
So which one is right?

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.080 align:middle line:84%
We were getting
the right answers

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:84%
from a completely different
approach than quantum theory.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we solved all of
that using classical mechanics

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.150 align:middle line:90%
or semi-classical.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So we wrote another scaling law
to see if our proton mass was

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in the right ballpark
in our universe.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.570 align:middle line:84%
We plotted all the
data points again.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, we
used mass against radius.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.140 align:middle line:84%
We started with universe,
and we went all the way down

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.290 align:middle line:90%
to the Planck's mass.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And we plotted many, many
different data points

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:90%
in between.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:59.150 align:middle line:84%
We used galaxies,
quasars, even our sun.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.790 align:middle line:90%
We put even the Earth in there.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.740 align:middle line:90%
We used pulsars.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we plotted our
Schwarzschild proton,

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:13.476 align:middle line:84%
our black hole proton, and
it fell almost perfectly

00:45:13.476 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:90%
on the linear progression.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Remarkable.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
However, the standard
proton with a mass

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.190 align:middle line:84%
of 10 to the minus
24, didn't even

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:31.930 align:middle line:84%
come close, completely
off in left field.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:38.400 align:middle line:84%
That confirmed to us that our
black hole proton was actually

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:84%
much more aligned with
the fundamental principles

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.660 align:middle line:90%
of our universe.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Our proton mass produced a
large gravitational field.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we looked at
the gravitational field,

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:middle line:84%
we found that it was
actually exactly the amount

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.420 align:middle line:84%
of attraction that we
needed between protons

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.400 align:middle line:90%
to overcome the Coulomb force.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.980 align:middle line:84%
The Coulomb force is the force
that pushes protons apart.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.390 align:middle line:84%
It's an electrostatic
charge, just

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:14.000 align:middle line:84%
like two magnets that
are approached together

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.270 align:middle line:84%
tend to want to repel if
they're the same polarity.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, the protons are squished
with the same polarity

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.520 align:middle line:90%
into a very small nuclei.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Coulomb force
would be very, very strong.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we calculated for
two little black hole proton,

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.220 align:middle line:84%
we found that the
gravitational force

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:36.170 align:middle line:84%
was exactly what it
needed to be to squish

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:41.150 align:middle line:84%
those protons together
against the Coulomb repulsion.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And this way, we could eliminate
one of the fundamental force

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of quantum theory
called the strong force.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, we
united the quantum world

00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:84%
with relativistic equation,
with the equations

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that describes black holes,
galaxies, planets, stars,

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:90%
and now the atomic level.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.570 align:middle line:90%
What is dividing the vacuum?

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:19.950 align:middle line:90%
How does it divide?

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.640 align:middle line:90%
What is its structure?

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.140 align:middle line:90%
How does it become coherent?

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Is there are fundamental
geometry that defines it all?

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>While searching for
this fundamental structure

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum in physics
and mathematical equations,

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Haramein discovered
geometrical knowledge

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.670 align:middle line:84%
in other curious places,
ancient text and traditions.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Unknown to him at the time,
many famous physicists

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.840 align:middle line:84%
found supporting data from
historical manuscripts,

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:54.180 align:middle line:84%
including the founder of modern
physical science, Isaac Newton.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And German astronomer
Johannes Kepler

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.860 align:middle line:84%
used geometrical concepts often
found in ancient knowledge

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to elaborate the mechanics
of our solar system.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>I looked at various traditions
around the world, the Mayan,

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:10.750 align:middle line:90%
the Incas, the Egyptian.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found that many
of them, including

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese, the
Japanese, and so on,

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.780 align:middle line:84%
had made very geometric
structures all

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.300 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:28.050 align:middle line:10%
One of them is Teotihuacan,
amazing complex north

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:33.370 align:middle line:10%
of Mexico City that included the
Sun Pyramid, the Moon Pyramid,

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.800 align:middle line:10%
the Way of the Dead, and
many complex structures all

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.970 align:middle line:10%
around it.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I found that a
survey had been done

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:45.900 align:middle line:84%
by an American engineer called
Hugh Harleston Jr. He had spent

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.860 align:middle line:84%
20 years mapping out
the relationship of all

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.650 align:middle line:90%
these buildings to each other.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And as he did, he
found that there

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.930 align:middle line:84%
was some fundamental
mathematical constant that

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.600 align:middle line:90%
were involved.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.510 align:middle line:10%
I had already come
up with the concept

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:10%
that a tetrahedron
would be involved

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:11.120 align:middle line:10%
in the structure of the vacuum,
since it's the most stable

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.510 align:middle line:10%
of the platonic solids.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
But what Hugh
Harleston Jr. found

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is that not only did this
ancient complex portray

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:25.180 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the
planets in their orbits

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:28.590 align:middle line:84%
relative to our
sun, but as well,

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.750 align:middle line:84%
had a fundamental
mathematical constant

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that related a
tetrahedron to a sphere.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Why would the ancient Mayans
represent this very specific

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:45.150 align:middle line:84%
relationship between a
tetrahedron and a sphere?

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe,
just maybe, they

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.100 align:middle line:84%
were trying to deliver a
message throughout the ages

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.580 align:middle line:84%
about the importance
of that relationship,

00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.060 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the vacuum
as a tetrahedral structure

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and the sphere as the
boundary condition

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.320 align:middle line:90%
that divided the space.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.920 align:middle line:90%
I looked into it deeper.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And I found that not only these
mathematics were portrayed

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.300 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship of the
buildings in that complex,

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:18.450 align:middle line:84%
but that the complex
itself, position

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:21.360 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the Earth, mapped

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.010 align:middle line:84%
the relationship of a
tetrahedron in a sphere.

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
very significant.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.245 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a coincidence.

00:50:28.245 --> 00:50:31.080 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Energy events across
the solar system

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:38.100 align:middle line:84%
frequently happen along or
near the 19.47 meridian,

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.310 align:middle line:84%
which is the base of
the inverted tetrahedron

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth's sphere.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.240 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid system at
Teotihuacan in Mexico

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.590 align:middle line:10%
lies on this
meridian as does one

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.850 align:middle line:10%
of the most active
volcanoes on Earth.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Kilauea in Hawaii has
been erupting continuously

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:57.720 align:middle line:84%
for the last 19 years and
shows no sign of stopping.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.360 align:middle line:84%
The largest volcano in our
solar system is located on Mars.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And it, too, is located
in this vicinity.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.650 align:middle line:84%
The well-documented
red spot on Jupiter,

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:10.720 align:middle line:84%
a large vortex-like storm
larger than the Earth,

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:16.600 align:middle line:84%
is also stabilized near this
critical 19.47 latitude.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>As I studied more geometry, I
came across Buckminster Fuller.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.060 align:middle line:10%
He had done much work in
describing complex geometry

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.040 align:middle line:10%
relative to our reality.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.470 align:middle line:10%
And Buckminster Fuller
came to conclude

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.740 align:middle line:10%
that the fundamental
blueprint of the universe

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:10%
was what he called an isotropic
vector metric or a four

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:43.470 align:middle line:10%
frequency isotropic
vector metric.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:84%
There is 20 tetrahedron
in the four frequencies

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:53.170 align:middle line:84%
or tropic vector metric, 10 on
the bottom, 6 in the middle,

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:57.080 align:middle line:84%
3 on the third
floor, and 1 on top.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And it makes a
larger tetrahedron

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.150 align:middle line:90%
when it's put together.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
What I was interested in
was the negative space.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what's in
between the tetrahedrons.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.670 align:middle line:84%
When you put tetrahedrons
edge to edge or edge-bounded,

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:15.560 align:middle line:90%
you get octahedrons in between.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Octahedrons are
pyramids base to base,

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:90%
emphasis on the word pyramid.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.390 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at
the negative space,

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I found that there was
another set of tetrahedrons

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that was like the
negative negative space.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And those tetrahedrons
in the middle

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.800 align:middle line:84%
were reverse and
rotated 180 degrees.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
they were doing there.

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It was like there was asymmetry
in the isotropic vector metric.

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.480 align:middle line:84%
With the word isotropic, you
would expect no asymmetry.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for a
perfect equilibrium.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So this was not
satisfactory to me.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I had to figure out what
these other tetrahedrons were

00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:59.740 align:middle line:90%
doing there.

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I realized that one isotropic
vector metric could not

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.100 align:middle line:90%
be alone.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.900 align:middle line:90%
It had to be polarized.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I stacked two
on top of each other.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:84%
However, now I add
another problem.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The two on top of each
other didn't make a sphere.

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:19.750 align:middle line:90%
It made an egg.

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And the concept I had developed
was that the tetrahedrons

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:28.010 align:middle line:84%
produced the sphere that divides
the boundary from infinitely

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.240 align:middle line:90%
large to infinitely small.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.970 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't know what to do.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:35.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like an egg
and a chicken problem.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought about it for
weeks, eventually realizing

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that I had to push
one into the other.

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to distort the
geometry of the tetrahedron.

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But when I actually got the
two so that they would produce

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:55.360 align:middle line:84%
a perfect sphere,
I realized what

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.100 align:middle line:84%
these other negative
negative space were for.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:05.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the one metric was
awaiting its better half.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It was not actually complete
until the reverse metric

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.960 align:middle line:90%
was inserted into it.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And when it was, all of a
sudden these other spaces

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:84%
were there to accept
the reverse tetrahedron,

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.420 align:middle line:84%
like one tetrahedron
male metric was

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.620 align:middle line:90%
waiting for its counterpart.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:90%
It was remarkable.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.320 align:middle line:10%
It was the polarities
coming together

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.750 align:middle line:10%
to produce the perfect sphere.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:39.580 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at what geometry
was produced in the middle.

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.400 align:middle line:10%
No tetrahedrons were distorted.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:10%
And the resulting geometry in
the middle is a cuboctahedron.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:51.020 align:middle line:10%
Why is a cuboctahedron
important?

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.200 align:middle line:10%
Because Buckminster
Fuller coined it

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.200 align:middle line:10%
the vector equilibrium.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:00.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the only geometry
in perfect equilibrium

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.590 align:middle line:90%
in all vectorial possibility.

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And that was exactly
what I was looking for,

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:12.120 align:middle line:84%
the polarities coming together
to produce singularity,

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to produce perfect
equilibrium at its center.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought this must be the
geometry of the vacuum.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Buckminster Fuller reasoned
that if the force of a vector

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.110 align:middle line:84%
is its length and two
vectors are driven

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:84%
against each other in
opposite directions,

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.770 align:middle line:90%
you will get equilibrium.

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But it will be
unstable equilibrium

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.470 align:middle line:84%
because any other force
in any other direction

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.080 align:middle line:90%
can break the balance.

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.450 align:middle line:84%
You could add two more
vectors at 90 degrees

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.080 align:middle line:90%
from the initial point.

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But in that case,
the edge vectors

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that contain the geometry would
be longer than the vectors

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to the center,
creating instability.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Fuller realized that the
edge vectors and the vectors

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.400 align:middle line:84%
to the center have to
be the same distance.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.340 align:middle line:10%
This creates a hexagon
or, in three dimension,

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:10%
a cuboctahedron.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.960 align:middle line:10%
or vector equilibrium.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.830 align:middle line:10%
From this, Haramein
concluded that this structure

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.080 align:middle line:10%
must be the geometry
of the vacuum,

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.920 align:middle line:10%
since in perfect equilibrium,
all the forces would

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.783 align:middle line:10%
cancel out and appear
to us to be empty space.

00:56:20.783 --> 00:56:24.230 align:middle line:90%


00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>However, I had found
yet another issue.

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.900 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at the
geometry carefully,

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.570 align:middle line:84%
the vector equilibrium
in the middle

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.740 align:middle line:84%
was completely covered
with tetrahedrons.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But the edges of the metrics
still had open faces.

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for
perfect symmetry.

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So I had to continue
adding tetrahedrons

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:51.980 align:middle line:90%
to cover those faces.

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I had already two
isotropic vector metric

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.790 align:middle line:90%
of 20 tetrahedron each.

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.310 align:middle line:90%
That made it 40.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I had to add another 24
tetrahedrons to cover

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.490 align:middle line:84%
all of the faces
that were open faces

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:11.780 align:middle line:90%
on the edge of the metric.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:20.220 align:middle line:84%
20 plus 20 is 40, plus 24
brought me to 64 tetrahedron.

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:25.680 align:middle line:84%
This turned out to be a very
significant number, not only

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.850 align:middle line:84%
a number found in many
ancient traditions,

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:35.530 align:middle line:84%
but a number that is found
in many natural processes.

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The 64 tetrahedron
grid kind of bloomed

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:43.710 align:middle line:84%
into a whole new understanding
of the structure of the vacuum.

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:45.840 align:middle line:90%
It was exactly what I needed.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It had an equilibrium at
the center that was actually

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by
another equilibrium.

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And you could visualize
this structure growing

00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:02.070 align:middle line:84%
in perfect fractal octaves from
infinitely big to infinitely

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:03.170 align:middle line:90%
small.

00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I had not only my polarities
producing the equilibrium

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and singularity,
but as it did, it

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.310 align:middle line:84%
produced fractal
structures that could

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:18.780 align:middle line:84%
be scaled from infinitely
big to infinitely small.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I felt I had found
something very profound.

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:27.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a true three
dimensional fractal structure.

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:32.470 align:middle line:90%
And it grew in perfect octaves.

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I could see that this
metric could actually

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:39.030 align:middle line:84%
be built in a completely
different way as well.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:43.470 align:middle line:84%
It could be built out of
eight star tetrahedron,

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:47.640 align:middle line:84%
each made out of eight
tetrahedron each.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.470 align:middle line:84%
The eight star tetrahedron
coming together

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:54.920 align:middle line:90%
produce the 64 tetrahedron grid.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:59:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Each star tetrahedron are
built by eight tetrahedron,

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:05.760 align:middle line:84%
have their tetrahedron
pointing out, radiating out.

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they come
together, they

00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:09.940 align:middle line:84%
produce the vector
equilibrium in the middle,

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.100 align:middle line:84%
which is eight
tetrahedron pointing in.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:19.250 align:middle line:10%
So I had now both of the
side of the event horizon

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:23.870 align:middle line:10%
that produced the boundary
condition, the radiative side

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:28.450 align:middle line:10%
and the contractive side
of the event horizon.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I thought this is it.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.650 align:middle line:90%
I've found it.

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And I got very, very excited.

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought this has all of the
elements necessary for me to be

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:44.990 align:middle line:84%
able to map out and describe
the structure of the vacuum,

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:49.970 align:middle line:84%
the key to the knowledge
necessary to understand

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:52.810 align:middle line:90%
creation.

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, with the structure
of the vacuum realized,

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.000 align:middle line:84%
the next step was
resolving how it moves.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.020 align:middle line:84%
This required
updating the theories

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that proceeded Haramein.

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:06.210 align:middle line:84%
When Einstein wrote
general relativity,

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:08.610 align:middle line:84%
he described the
structure of spacetime

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:12.220 align:middle line:84%
as curving to produce
a gravitational field.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.870 align:middle line:84%
This was a change
from Newton, who

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:19.180 align:middle line:84%
believed gravity was a force
generated by the object itself.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Imagine a trampoline with a
mass on it, like a big ball.

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And the trampoline is
curve by that big ball.

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:30.670 align:middle line:84%
That trampoline
surface has elasticity.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine that another
ball is put on the trampoline.

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
That other ball would appear to
be attracted to that first one

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
due to the curvature of the
surface of the trampoline.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
When Einstein wrote
these equations,

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.980 align:middle line:90%
he didn't solve them.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.780 align:middle line:90%
He just wrote the concept.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the equation necessary
to describe the concept.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But the complexity
of finding a solution

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
was beyond what he
wanted to do at the time.

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So we published
general relativity.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And by an amazing
set of circumstances,

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
a gentleman called
Karl Schwarzschild,

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
a German physicist,
found Einstein's paper.

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And he saw this equation.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, hey,
I can solve this.

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And Karl Schwarzschild went
on to find the first solution

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.640 align:middle line:90%
to Einstein's field equations.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.555 align:middle line:84%
And that solution remains to
this day as the Schwarzschild

01:01:35.555 --> 01:01:36.055 align:middle line:90%
solution.

01:01:36.055 --> 01:01:38.730 align:middle line:90%


01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Unfortunately, months
after Karl Schwarzschild

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
solved Einstein's
field equations,

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.150 align:middle line:84%
he died of an
autoimmune disease,

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
leaving the solution
without any mention

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
about the spin of
the black hole.

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:54.460 align:middle line:10%
Spin and charge were
introduced in the 1960s

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:58.740 align:middle line:10%
in what is commonly known
as the Kerr-Newman solution.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
However, this theory
did not account

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.840 align:middle line:84%
for the gyroscopic
effect that Haramein

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.400 align:middle line:90%
knew needed to be accounted for.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>I had realized that
there's something

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
strange about the
way our physics has

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:14.270 align:middle line:90%
been addressing spin.

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
We might have missed
something in the way

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
we were describing spin
in our current physics.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
This led, again,
to another paper

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
written with Dr.
Elizabeth Rauscher.

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:31.770 align:middle line:10%
This paper was entitled
"The Origin of Spin."

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
It described a new way to define
the structure of spacetime.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
If the gyroscopic
effects are added,

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
that means that the trampoline
is not curving smoothly,

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
but it is spinning as it
curves, that spacetime

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.280 align:middle line:90%
has a fundamental spin.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Just like water
going down the drain

01:02:57.790 --> 01:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
doesn't go down
the drain straight;

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
it spins as it goes
down the drain.

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And that produces a
fundamental torque.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:10.140 align:middle line:10%
So torque and
Coriolis effect had

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:14.220 align:middle line:10%
to be put back in to
Einstein field equations.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.610 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Rauscher and I worked
diligently for over a year

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:22.310 align:middle line:10%
and a half to make that happen.

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
It gave a different picture of
the structure of a black hole.

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a spherical,
smooth surface,

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Coriolis effect were
involved, and the surface

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
was not a perfect
sphere, but a torus.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.180 align:middle line:90%
A torus is like a doughnut.

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It has a hole in the middle.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And the result, then, was
a dual torus structure.

01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Because of Coriolis
effect, one doughnut

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.090 align:middle line:90%
would be going in one direction.

01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And another doughnut
would be going

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.670 align:middle line:90%
in the opposite direction.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:01.610 align:middle line:84%
For every spin,
there's a counter-spin.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Just like the weather patterns
that we find on our planet,

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
where hurricanes spin in
one direction on the North

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
hemisphere and spin in the
other direction in the South

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.680 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And they meet at the equator
but go back to the poles

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:19.950 align:middle line:90%
and meet at the equator again.

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:22.610 align:middle line:84%
This animation
shows the movement

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
of a particle over the
metrical space of the structure

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of spacetime imbued with
torque and Coriolis effect.

01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you can
see that the information can

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
move to the poles in
towards the singularity

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and back out at the equator
and back into the pole.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And thus, you get this
feedback structure

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.910 align:middle line:84%
that could be found
at the atomic level.

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
For instance, this could be an
electron and a positron, or at

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
the stellar level,
where we see the plasma

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
dynamics around the sun that
produces the same dual torus

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:06.225 align:middle line:84%
dynamic, or at the
galactic level.

01:05:06.225 --> 01:05:12.160 align:middle line:90%


01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>What's in the
middle of a torus?

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
What's in the middle
of a doughnut?

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.320 align:middle line:90%
The hole, right?

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.160 align:middle line:90%
It's space, the vacuum.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the vacuum
connects all things.

01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Because the vacuum divides
not with the complete boundary

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
of a sphere, but with a
torus in which a vacuum is

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
at the center of every object
where you'd expect singularity,

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
infinite density
of a black hole.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But instead, it's the vacuum
which is infinitely dense

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and that connects all things.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It explains many different
things, including the way

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:06.840 align:middle line:84%
magnetic fields are produced and
where the origin of spin was.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Not only is spin inherent
to the structure of space

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
itself, but it is
prevalent at all level

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.880 align:middle line:84%
if the structure
of the vacuum acts

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
like a fluid, acts like
water going down the drain.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
electron and the positron

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
exchange and
disappear and reappear

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.410 align:middle line:90%
and disappear and reappear.

01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It seems to exchange
across the vacuum.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
That is, the vacuum fluctuates,
produce an electron,

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
fluctuates, and then
the electron disappear.

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The electron carries the
information from the material

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
world to the vacuum,
informs the vacuum.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the vacuum informs
back the material world

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
when the electron
comes back out.

01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, we actually
are constantly

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
appearing and disappearing
at a very rapid rate,

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.480 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that half the
time you're the vacuum?

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Who are you when
you're the vacuum?

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And what are you saying to
the rest of the universe

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
when you're
informing the vacuum?

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
From this model of
the double torus,

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
we start to have
an understanding

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:34.860 align:middle line:90%
of why consciousness emerges.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness demands feedback.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
In order for you
to be self-aware,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.710 align:middle line:90%
you must know that you exist.

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Thus, it demands feedback.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
This structure of
the double torus

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
allows for the
feedback between what's

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
coming from the outside that's
going back to the inside,

01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
informing the vacuum,
coming back out the outside.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And as it comes back
out the outside,

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum informs
us of the result

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
of the information
present in the vacuum.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It is an exchange between
your internal understanding

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:19.479 align:middle line:84%
and experience of the
universe and the relationship

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.920 align:middle line:84%
of all the understandings
put together

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.970 align:middle line:90%
in the vacuums affecting yours.

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're not
creating your reality.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:35.189 align:middle line:84%
You are co-creating your
reality with everybody else.

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:43.359 align:middle line:90%


01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>But how does the
double torus geometry

01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
relate to the tetrahedral
structure of the vacuum?

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
For Haramein, it
all came together

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.689 align:middle line:84%
when he visualized two isotropic
vector metrics surrounded

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:56.920 align:middle line:90%
by a toroidal field.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Each represents a polarity
of the Coriolis effect.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
As the two come together to
form the vector equilibrium,

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.729 align:middle line:84%
the double torus
structure is generated.

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:08.990 align:middle line:84%
When all the components
are producing equilibrium

01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:12.229 align:middle line:84%
at the center, the
result is singularity.

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:15.766 align:middle line:84%
And all of creation
emerges from it.

01:09:15.766 --> 01:09:18.899 align:middle line:90%


01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>When we solved this new
solution to Einstein's field

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:26.090 align:middle line:84%
equation with torque
and Coriolis effect,

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:28.979 align:middle line:84%
we found that we
could mathematically

01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
show a fundamental relationship
between the cuboctahedron

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:36.870 align:middle line:90%
and the double torus as well.

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:40.899 align:middle line:10%
And when we did that, it
produces all the information

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:45.140 align:middle line:10%
we need to generate a
unified field theory.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So this relationship between
the structure of the vacuum

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and the dynamical division
of the vacuum based

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
on spin, torque,
Coriolis effect,

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
produce a complete understanding
of the geometry of space

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and the reality that
emerges from space.

01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Look at this galaxy,
for instance.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
stars are emerging

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
from the central bulge, in which
an enormous black hole lives.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
We know now that
there's a black hole

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
all the galaxies.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, this
theory, as well,

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
predicted that galaxies are
the result of black holes, not

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:35.740 align:middle line:90%
the cause.

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
That is that the material
reality we see emerging

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
is actually being produced
by the central heart

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.580 align:middle line:90%
of the galaxy, the black hole.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Particles are being created in
a continuous creation process.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Not just one big bang,
but continuous creation

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
at all levels of singularities
along the scaling

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:07.230 align:middle line:90%
of our universe.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
stars in a galaxy,

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
they emerge from the
central black hole

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and move in spiral path away
from it towards the edge.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
At the edge, they enter
into the galactic halo,

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
which is the edge
of the double torus.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they fall
back in at the top,

01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
just like the water
going down the drain.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.700 align:middle line:10%
From recent data,
not only do we find

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.490 align:middle line:10%
that black holes are at
the center of all galaxies,

01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:40.950 align:middle line:10%
but it seems that black holes
were there prior to galaxies.

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:43.750 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what this
theory would predict.

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Black holes are actually
a fundamental pattern

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.560 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum itself that
produces matter, and then

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
eventually becomes visible to us
as a galaxy, a star, a planet,

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.630 align:middle line:90%
an atom, a subatomic particle.

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
This view, then, changes
our concepts of black holes.

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Black holes should no longer
be written black holes H-O-L-E,

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:17.970 align:middle line:90%
but wholes, W-H-O-L-E.

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:21.380 align:middle line:84%
They're no longer just
absorbing information,

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
but they radiate
information as well.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.690 align:middle line:90%
They're black, white holes.

01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're on the inside
of the black hole,

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:36.260 align:middle line:84%
like when you're inside our
universe, it appears black.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you're on the outside
of the event horizon,

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:43.000 align:middle line:90%
they appear white, very bright.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.150 align:middle line:84%
They radiate information, just
like stars in our universe.

01:12:48.150 --> 01:13:23.490 align:middle line:90%


01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:27.460 align:middle line:84%
All this relates
nicely to many concepts

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that are found in ancient
civilizations, many concepts

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that talk about the center of
all things having God in it.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha is at the
center of all things.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
That the Kingdom of Heaven
is within our center.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Many tradition talks about
us turning our senses inwards

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and going towards the
center of our existence

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:57.700 align:middle line:84%
to link with the whole
universe from the center

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.430 align:middle line:90%
of our experience.

01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
We find this said in
many different ways

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
from many masters all around
the world in ancient traditions.

01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:13.170 align:middle line:10%
And in these same
ancient traditions,

01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:17.490 align:middle line:10%
we find very
interesting buildings.

01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
For instance, take
the pyramid at Giza.

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Pyramid at Giza
is a remarkable building.

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It's made out of approximately
2,300,000 stones.

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It stands at 481
feet of altitude.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
After placing 2,300,000
stones, the apex

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:47.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Grand Pyramid
at Giza is a quarter

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of an inch off center off the
base of a 13 acre surface.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Is that possible with the
means that the Egyptians had

01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:02.850 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years ago?

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Or is it even possible
with the means of

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
construction and
engineering we have today?

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
If you calculate how
precisely each block had

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:21.550 align:middle line:84%
to be placed from the ground
up, front the base up,

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
to achieve this
level of accuracy

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:31.230 align:middle line:84%
at the apex of the pyramid,
it exceeds our accuracy

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
with the best tools we have
in our modern society today.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.680 align:middle line:10%
So could that really
have been made

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.990 align:middle line:10%
by a bunch of farmers and
slaves 5,000 years ago pulling

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:49.540 align:middle line:10%
on vine ropes with
logs and so on?

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
When we study buildings
all around the world,

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:57.730 align:middle line:90%
we find very interesting things.

01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Many pyramids sites
around the world

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.850 align:middle line:84%
seem to represent a very
specific constellation

01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:06.570 align:middle line:90%
in our sky.

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:09.626 align:middle line:84%
That constellation is
the Orion constellation.

01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:13.830 align:middle line:90%


01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:16.070 align:middle line:10%
>>This discovery was
made only recently

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:20.330 align:middle line:10%
by Egyptian-born engineer
Robert Bauval and writer,

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:22.780 align:middle line:10%
explorer Graham Hancock.

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:26.390 align:middle line:10%
If you view the pyramid Giza
and her two companion pyramids

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:29.360 align:middle line:10%
from the sky at
night, the three axes

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.860 align:middle line:10%
line up very closely with the
belt in Orion's constellation.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.060 align:middle line:10%
Hancock and Bauval discovered
that the Orion map also

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.350 align:middle line:10%
lines up in the same
fashion with the pyramids

01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:42.230 align:middle line:10%
at Teotihuacan Mexico.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.380 align:middle line:10%
The sun, the moon,
and a smaller pyramid

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.970 align:middle line:10%
emulate this connection
between stars and structures.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:52.160 align:middle line:10%
This mystery continues
across the globe in China,

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.780 align:middle line:10%
where three pyramids close
to the same size as Giza

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.250 align:middle line:10%
and Teotihuacan are located.

01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:02.100 align:middle line:10%
It is unlikely that these
alignments are coincidental.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.710 align:middle line:10%
Many of these structures also
have another commonality.

01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The stones are enormous and
include unusual precision

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:13.890 align:middle line:84%
carvings between the
blocks as well as on them.

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>In this case, we find
a very important symbol.

01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
The symbol is known
as the flower of life.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
What's intriguing
about this symbol

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not etched
or carved into the rock.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed to be laser
burned into the atomic structure

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
of the stone with
an instrument that

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
is not easily reproducible,
even with our technology today.

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:52.424 align:middle line:84%
When we look at this symbol
and we extrapolate it

01:17:52.424 --> 01:17:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to three dimensions,
it looks like bubbles

01:17:58.230 --> 01:18:00.550 align:middle line:90%
all agglomerated together.

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And it defines the
position and the geometry

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:07.960 align:middle line:90%
of a 64 tetrahedral grid.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:24.470 align:middle line:90%


01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Were they trying to tell
us something significant

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
about the structure
of space in such a way

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that it could not be erased
throughout ages of erosion?

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Were they trying to
tell us something

01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:41.030 align:middle line:84%
about the technology
that was used

01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
to move these large rocks
along long distances?

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we look
in ancient Egypt,

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
nowhere do we find
in hieroglyphs

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:54.580 align:middle line:84%
or a series of
hieroglyphs or texts

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that tells us how they built
the pyramid, how they moved

01:18:58.350 --> 01:19:02.230 align:middle line:84%
the stone, how they got the
accuracy necessary to do such

01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:04.620 align:middle line:90%
a job.

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere in those texts
they tells us about sun gods,

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:16.010 align:middle line:84%
about these beings that seemed
to have come from very far away

01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:20.620 align:middle line:84%
in our universe and that
brought information with them,

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
knowledge such as
engineering and writing

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and so on that they educated
the people of the Earth

01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:31.240 align:middle line:90%
with, very advanced people.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe advanced people
were interacting

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
with humans in
pre-history, in time

01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
prior to our written history.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
This type of knowledge is
found across many different

01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
countries, across
different many cultures,

01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
for instance, in China
where pyramids are found.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
China has symbols associated
with their knowledge

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:02.220 align:middle line:90%
base, famous symbols.

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:06.250 align:middle line:90%
For instance, the yin and yang.

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:11.110 align:middle line:84%
The yin yang symbol is very
similar to the double torus

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:14.720 align:middle line:90%
structure viewed from above.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:19.120 align:middle line:10%
Associated with this symbol
is a set of mathematics,

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.740 align:middle line:10%
a set of symbols
called the I Ching.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:28.880 align:middle line:84%
The I Ching is
made of 64 symbols.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And each symbol is made of
six sticks, six full sticks

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:39.320 align:middle line:90%
or six broken sticks.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Six sticks put
together in three space

01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:47.110 align:middle line:90%
can only produce a tetrahedron.

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And when a star
tetrahedron is generated,

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
you will be required
to break the sticks

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
of the reverse tetrahedron
to put it through the other.

01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So by following the I
Ching, we can actually

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
rebuild the whole
64 tetrahedron grid.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And that associated
with the yin and yang

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:16.000 align:middle line:84%
produces the double
torus and the structure

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum, all
the information

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
necessary to describe this
profound understanding

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
of creation and the structure
of the vacuum producing it.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:36.850 align:middle line:90%


01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look in
China, you find as well

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.410 align:middle line:90%
the Forbidden City.

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:47.290 align:middle line:84%
The Forbidden City is
guarded by the Foo Dogs.

01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
The Foo Dogs are the analog
of the Sphinx in Egypt.

01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
They are considered
the guardians,

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.890 align:middle line:90%
the guardian of knowledge.

01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And they guard the knowledge
by keeping it under their paw.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
When we look under the paw of
the Foo Dog, what do we find?

01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, the same fundamental
geometry of these intersecting

01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
spheres, in this case,
in complete 3D structure

01:22:21.610 --> 01:22:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that embeds the tetrahedral
array of the vacuum.

01:22:26.410 --> 01:22:30.990 align:middle line:10%
It's found in the Hebrew
tradition, where the Hebrew

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:35.720 align:middle line:10%
God is typically represented
as a tetrahedron sitting

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.320 align:middle line:10%
on a throne.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And he is not typically
represented in ancient Hebrew

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
tradition as an old
man with a beard.

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:49.500 align:middle line:84%
When we look deeper into
the Hebrew tradition

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and the Old Testament,
it seems that it

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
refers to a very
specific object that

01:22:56.090 --> 01:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
had all sorts of properties
as the power of God.

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant of God, it

01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
is described as a
very powerful object.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of these
advanced technologies

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
that were given to us by the
Sun God remained in our culture.

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant was described

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:24.490 align:middle line:84%
as this very bright
object, this object that

01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:28.570 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of radiation
coming out of it.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's typically represented
as producing a large vortex

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
or cloud above it.

01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It's described in
Rabbinic tradition

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.650 align:middle line:84%
as an object that
could lift itself

01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and that could lift
its carriers with it.

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Those would be evidence
of gravitational effects.

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the word
God in the Old Testament,

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
actually we find that
it's a translation

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of a Greek word called
the tetragrammaton.

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
The tetragrammaton is
typically represented

01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:10.575 align:middle line:84%
as a triangle with
the letters of God

01:24:10.575 --> 01:24:13.400 align:middle line:84%
in it in the
Kabbalistic traditions.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Tetra can stand for tetrahedron.

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It, as well, is the
Greek word for four.

01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Grammaton, however, has
always been interpreted

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.370 align:middle line:84%
as grammar for the four
letters of God, Yahweh.

01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The root word of
the word grammaton

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:38.280 align:middle line:84%
can be as well grams
or gravity and refers

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.000 align:middle line:90%
to the weight of an object.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a
word for the word God

01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that includes the
tetra and gravity.

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a double meaning
to the word God in the Bible.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, with this
Kabbalistic tradition

01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:00.690 align:middle line:90%
comes a very important geometry.

01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It is said that if this
geometry is decoded,

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of
the fundamental nature

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.372 align:middle line:90%
of the universe can be achieved.

01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:13.970 align:middle line:90%
It is the Kabbalistic tree.

01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It is akin to the
tree of knowledge.

01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
It's thought to be the
fundamental principle

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.320 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I looked at it in
details and spent

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%
many months trying to decode it.

01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:31.270 align:middle line:10%
At one time, I realized
that the bottom part

01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:35.110 align:middle line:10%
of the Kabbalistic
tree is a tetrahedron

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:38.990 align:middle line:10%
and that the top part
is an octahedron.

01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
However, I had this box
in between with an x in it

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:45.590 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't sure
where it fitted.

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I eventually came
to understand that I

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:52.370 align:middle line:84%
could slide the bottom
part into the top part.

01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I do so, it
became a three dimensional

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.670 align:middle line:84%
object, giving me
all the vertices

01:25:58.670 --> 01:26:01.840 align:middle line:90%
to produce the star tetrahedron.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, further, the
Kabbalistic tradition

01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:06.750 align:middle line:84%
says there's not just
one tree, but there

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:10.920 align:middle line:84%
is four, and that there's
a principle of mirroring

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.470 align:middle line:90%
of the trees.

01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:15.110 align:middle line:84%
If there is four,
and they're mirrored,

01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
that means all
together there's eight.

01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And it says that they
all attach at the root.

01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
If I attach eight Kabbalistic
tree together and decode them,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
in each one into
star tetrahedrons,

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
then I have a 64
tetrahedron grid.

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Kabbalistic
tree has been decoded.

01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that
it's been decoded?

01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I can actually
take the two dimensional

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
image of the Kabbalistic
tree and plaster

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
it back onto the 64
tetrahedron grid.

01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:55.940 align:middle line:84%
This kind of the
loop in the code

01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is actually described in the
Kabbalistic tradition, where

01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
it says that the
root is attached,

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and then the crown
is attached, and then

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.620 align:middle line:90%
the root is attached again.

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
The really interesting thing
about these Kabbalistic trees

01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:14.750 align:middle line:84%
coming together is that
when you decode them,

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:18.490 align:middle line:84%
it's like they're being
compressed into the center.

01:27:18.490 --> 01:27:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And they become the
star tetrahedron.

01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So you actually have the sense
of the compressive contractive

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:28.740 align:middle line:90%
part of the vacuum structure.

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:33.650 align:middle line:84%
They're collapsing together
producing the star tetrahedrons

01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and the 64 tetrahedron
grid of the vacuum when

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.280 align:middle line:90%
they are put together.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.665 align:middle line:84%
The root of the Kabbalistic
tree becomes the singularity.

01:27:43.665 --> 01:28:01.530 align:middle line:90%


01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>The Mayans, the
Egyptians, Chinese, Hebrew,

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:08.100 align:middle line:90%
and many others.

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.190 align:middle line:10%
Were these ancient civilizations
from all different points

01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:13.890 align:middle line:10%
across the globe leaving
us detailed information

01:28:13.890 --> 01:28:16.710 align:middle line:10%
about the structure
of the vacuum

01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:20.360 align:middle line:10%
and even the fundamental
physics of creation?

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.740 align:middle line:84%
According to Haramein,
the structure

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
of the vacuum and the
fluctuations of energy in it

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.560 align:middle line:84%
are at the foundation
of all our reality

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and even the consciousness
that animates it.

01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:36.030 align:middle line:84%
We are in a relationship with
the universe at all times,

01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
exchanging information
on all scales.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Has the time come when we can
finally wake and acknowledge

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
this powerful connection
and even harmonize with it?

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>I think we are standing at the
brinks of this transition, one

01:28:56.140 --> 01:29:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest transition a
society can ever go through.

01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
A transition from a
society that believes

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that there is limited
amount of goods,

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that there is limited amount
of space and that wars

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
for it to a society
that realizes

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that they are bathing in an
infinite amount of energy

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.690 align:middle line:84%
available to them
anywhere in the universe,

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and that that energy is
the source of all creation.

01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:31.590 align:middle line:84%
A society that understands
how this fluctuation of energy

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:36.580 align:middle line:84%
functions, how it structures,
how it produces our material

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
world and hooks into
it, taps into it,

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and aligns its technology
to it in an harmonious way

01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to transform the way they think
of energy and transportation

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and actually ascend from
the surface of their planet.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
A society that has
the capacity to move

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:02.370 align:middle line:84%
through their solar
system in an easy way,

01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and to move through
even the galaxy,

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
or even from galactic structures
to other galactic structures,

01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
or even from universes
to other universes.

01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
As such, a society
does not think

01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.600 align:middle line:90%
of the universe as limited.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.960 align:middle line:84%
A society such as
this one, I believe,

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
is the opportunity that is being
offered to us at this time.

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:30.140 align:middle line:90%
This is the ride we're on.

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to
be a full participant.

01:30:36.210 --> 01:32:05.600 align:middle line:90%
