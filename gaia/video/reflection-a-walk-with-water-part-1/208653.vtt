And that cauliflower was
harvested in the morning,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.110 align:middle line:84%

That was a perfect example of
what we'd do 95% of the time.

But there are those
times, like over here, we

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:84%
had a bed that
overwintered with cabbages.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And it overwintered
and got very weedy.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
we didn't want

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.770 align:middle line:84%
to have to pull
out all the weeds

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:84%
because if you pull out weeds,
you're removing all the topsoil

with the weed roots.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%

the weeds, well,

they regrow better
than the vegetables do.

through covering it with a
breathable landscape fabric.

So there's still oxygen
and gases exchange.

There's still moisture
exchange, and yet

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
the blocking of
sunlight is going

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.770 align:middle line:84%
to decompose all the
weeds in place so

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that after three or four
weeks of having a cover on,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
we can peel back that
cover, and the bed

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.890 align:middle line:84%
will be completely
clear and clean.

there for three or four weeks,

peel it off.
