00:12:58.967 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Mmm.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.667 align:middle line:90%
That's delicious.

00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:04.067 align:middle line:90%
>> We met through work.

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:06.333 align:middle line:90%
I work with his colleagues.

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:08.367 align:middle line:84%
>> On her last day,
I had just come back,

00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and we met really
for 10 minutes.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.333 align:middle line:84%
And then we actually
started doing work together.

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:15.067 align:middle line:90%
We collaborated together.

00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:16.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you leaving?

00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:16.833 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you are.

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm leaving in one minute.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.733 align:middle line:84%
>> I was divorced, and we
started a friendship that ended

00:13:24.733 --> 00:13:27.233 align:middle line:90%
in a deeper relation.

00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:29.967 align:middle line:10%
>> NYU Hospital here in
Manhattan was plunged

00:13:29.967 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:10%
into darkness, its
generators failing.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.167 align:middle line:10%
>> We were getting very close,
and then came Hurricane Sandy.

00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I was the Chief of
Medicine at NYU.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I got a phone call that said we
have to evacuate the hospital.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, if you're
going, I'm going with you.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.867 align:middle line:10%
We came home.

00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:49.700 align:middle line:90%
It was early in the morning.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.233 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, who would I

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:54.767 align:middle line:90%
rather spend my life with?

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:57.533 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I
proposed to Gloria.

00:13:57.533 --> 00:13:59.633 align:middle line:84%

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Don't touch my hand
in public, Marty.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Why not?

[CHUCKLES]

00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:10.667 align:middle line:90%
I was a city kid.

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Queens.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of been
exploring all my life.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.533 align:middle line:84%
I rode on freight
trains, in boxcars.

00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They say that the
first time you pee off

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.467 align:middle line:84%
the side of a boxcar
you're hooked.

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:31.433 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I wanted to
become an architect,

00:14:31.433 --> 00:14:33.933 align:middle line:84%
but I discovered
at a very early age

00:14:33.933 --> 00:14:36.633 align:middle line:90%
that I had no talent for that.

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:40.633 align:middle line:84%
I went into the specialty of
infectious diseases trying

00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:45.733 align:middle line:84%
to solve very complex problems,
patients who are very ill.

00:14:45.733 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:10%
I was really interested
in questioning why.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.367 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
point, I found out

00:14:52.367 --> 00:14:54.967 align:middle line:84%
that I could answer some
of my own questions,

00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and that was very exciting.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.133 align:middle line:84%
>> So are you going to
the VA first or Bellevue?

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:02.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Bellevue.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.533 align:middle line:84%
I believe the
hypothesis is correct,

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:16.233 align:middle line:84%
that antibiotics are
contributing to the rise of all

00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:17.933 align:middle line:90%
these diseases.

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:20.467 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody
believes that's correct.

00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:24.667 align:middle line:84%
And so the job of a scientist
is to examine questions and see

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
if we can find more
evidence that it's true

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.567 align:middle line:84%
and try to understand
the details.

00:15:29.567 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's true for some
diseases, but not others.

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:38.633 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we do
experiments in the lab

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:41.033 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand,
how does it work?

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:42.633 align:middle line:90%
What are the mechanisms?

00:15:42.633 --> 00:15:45.067 align:middle line:84%
What's the percent
difference in weight there?

00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:47.467 align:middle line:84%
These guys got the antibiotic
and then the bacteria.

00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:48.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:51.367 align:middle line:84%
>> And these guys got the
bacteria, no antibiotic.

>> When I compare the oral and
nasal microbiome of Amerindians

00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:59.667 align:middle line:84%

a clear distinction between

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.667 align:middle line:90%
the microbiomes.

00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:05.067 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't think that
has ever been shown before.

>> We've been
studying metabolism.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.633 align:middle line:84%
We've been studying immunity

[CHEERING]

00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:33.667 align:middle line:84%
>> And our two main topics
in the lab are obesity

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:36.333 align:middle line:90%
and diabetes.

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:10%
If you compare people
with type 2 diabetes

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:10%
to people who don't
have type 2 diabetes,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.533 align:middle line:10%
who had been more
exposed to antibiotics?

00:16:44.533 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is people with
diabetes, significantly more.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.967 align:middle line:84%
And to me, these numbers
are not just a coincidence.

00:16:52.967 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes is a disease
in which there's

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.467 align:middle line:84%
too much sugar in the
blood and a lot of that

00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:59.133 align:middle line:90%
has to do with obesity.

00:16:59.133 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:84%
In societies, whenever
there's more obesity,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.367 align:middle line:90%
there's more type II diabetes.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.033 align:middle line:90%
Obesity is such a huge problem.

00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:12.633 align:middle line:84%
And it has been
growing dramatically.

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:15.767 align:middle line:84%
And the current
hypothesis about obesity,

00:17:15.767 --> 00:17:18.533 align:middle line:84%
about calories, et
cetera, are important,

00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're not sufficient to
explain why this has occurred.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.867 align:middle line:84%
It's now been 70 years
since farmers discovered

00:17:26.867 --> 00:17:29.367 align:middle line:84%
that if they gave antibiotics
to their farm animals,

00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:30.533 align:middle line:90%
they would fatten them up.

00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And the earlier in
life they started it,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:90%
the more profound the effect.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Some antibiotics added to the
feed of young animals promote

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:90%
more rapid growth.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.867 align:middle line:84%
The larger pig was raised on
feed containing an antibiotic.

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
The other, from the
same litter, was not.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.467 align:middle line:84%
>> All of a sudden,
it occurred to me,

00:17:49.467 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe the use of antibiotics
early in life in our children

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.833 align:middle line:90%
is fattening up our kids.

00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:59.433 align:middle line:84%
And so we began to
do studies in mice.

00:17:59.433 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And our results were
quite consistent,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.033 align:middle line:84%
that if we give antibiotics
to mice, they become fat.

00:18:06.033 --> 00:18:09.733 align:middle line:84%
If we put mice on a high
calorie diet, they become fat.

00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:13.667 align:middle line:10%
And if we put them on both
together, they become very fat.

00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And so all of this made me
ask, how else could antibiotics

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.967 align:middle line:90%
be affecting our kids?

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:24.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, guys.

00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.267 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you doing?

00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:26.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:18:26.533 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.533 align:middle line:90%
>> You want some coffee?

00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:29.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, please.

00:18:29.933 --> 00:18:30.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:18:30.733 --> 00:18:33.633 align:middle line:84%
>> When she was in her 20s,
my daughter Genia picked up

00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:35.533 align:middle line:90%
a parasitic infection.

00:18:35.533 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I was in Peru.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:90%
I had some ceviche.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And then when I returned to
the US, a couple of days later,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:90%
I was having digestive symptoms.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was prescribed a dosage
of a powerful antibiotic that

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.067 align:middle line:84%
basically just clears
out your system.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.933 align:middle line:84%
And then over the
following two years,

00:18:56.933 --> 00:18:59.533 align:middle line:84%
five or six other
prescriptions as I

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:02.767 align:middle line:84%
continued to have
stomach symptoms.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
That's when we were
able to figure out

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.333 align:middle line:84%
that I had celiac, that I
have this gluten allergy.

00:19:09.333 --> 00:19:12.267 align:middle line:84%
>> To understand my ideas about
what happened to Genia we have

00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:15.467 align:middle line:84%
to go back years before
she ever went to Peru.

00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:18.667 align:middle line:84%
When she was a young girl,
she had many ear infections.

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:21.867 align:middle line:84%
And like millions of parents,
we took her to the doctor.

00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:10%
And each time, the doctor
prescribed antibiotics.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that combination
of those early childhood

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.133 align:middle line:84%
antibiotics and those
later antibiotics,

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:37.033 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of what led you to
this problem, which, of course,

00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:39.567 align:middle line:90%
I feel terrible about.

00:19:39.567 --> 00:19:42.233 align:middle line:84%
Early life, that's when
they're developing.

00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:44.067 align:middle line:84%
They're developing
their immunity.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
They're developing
their metabolism.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.167 align:middle line:84%
They're developing
their brain function.

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the critical time.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.867 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
time when kids are

00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:90%
getting the most antibiotics.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.533 align:middle line:84%
We thought we were
doing you a favor.

00:19:55.533 --> 00:19:59.367 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking, if
we put you on antibiotics,

00:19:59.367 --> 00:20:01.267 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have to
have tubes in your ears.

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:03.533 align:middle line:84%
But in retrospect, it
would have been better.

00:20:03.533 --> 00:20:06.067 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't know it.

00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:08.767 align:middle line:84%
There's a conversation going
on between our microbes

00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and our immune system,
especially in young children,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.433 align:middle line:84%
where the microbes
train the immune system

00:20:14.433 --> 00:20:18.267 align:middle line:90%
to distinguish friend from foe.

00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:22.467 align:middle line:84%
I believe that antibiotics
disrupt that communication.

00:20:22.467 --> 00:20:24.867 align:middle line:84%
And that's what opened the
door to Genia developing

00:20:24.867 --> 00:20:29.233 align:middle line:90%
celiac disease later in life.

00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:33.133 align:middle line:10%
>> And then I remembered that
I hated taking antibiotics,

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:10%
and you and mom basically bribed
me that if I would take it

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.267 align:middle line:10%
without complaining for like a
week or so, I could get my ears

00:20:40.267 --> 00:20:41.067 align:middle line:10%
pierced.

00:20:41.067 --> 00:20:45.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Bribing you to take
your antibiotic is--

00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:46.467 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:20:46.467 --> 00:20:51.067 align:middle line:90%
Mom apologized to me for it.

00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:54.367 align:middle line:84%
>> About half of all pregnant
women are receiving antibiotics

00:20:54.367 --> 00:20:57.067 align:middle line:84%
at some time during
their pregnancy.

00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And for kids in
the United States,

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.867 align:middle line:84%
by the time they're
two, they've had

00:21:00.867 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:84%
on average about three
courses of antibiotics.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.767 align:middle line:84%
By the time they're 10, about
10 courses of antibiotics.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So many of these chronic
diseases began in childhood.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.833 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's become
a focus of our work.

00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:19.367 align:middle line:84%
But an out of balance microbiome
can have repercussions

00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:20.833 align:middle line:90%
at any point in life.

00:21:26.733 --> 00:21:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2010, I ended
up getting C-diff.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.467 align:middle line:90%
And it was horrible.

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:37.133 align:middle line:10%
>> C. Difficile is a bacteria
that is resistant to most

00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:38.067 align:middle line:10%
antibiotics.

00:21:38.067 --> 00:21:40.333 align:middle line:10%
And some experts
say over-prescribing

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:43.867 align:middle line:10%
the medications is causing the
bacteria to become even more

00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:44.933 align:middle line:10%
deadly.

00:21:44.933 --> 00:21:46.367 align:middle line:10%
>> It's called C-diff.

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:48.533 align:middle line:10%
500,000 Americans have
it in their bodies.

00:21:48.533 --> 00:21:52.367 align:middle line:10%
15,000 people die
from it every year.

00:21:52.367 --> 00:21:55.267 align:middle line:90%
>> I was constantly sick.

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:58.367 align:middle line:84%
I would be afraid to eat
because anything I would eat

00:21:58.367 --> 00:22:01.067 align:middle line:90%
would just come right out.

00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:05.833 align:middle line:84%
So it would limit what I
wanted to do, where I would go.

00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I was very, very fatigued.

00:22:09.867 --> 00:22:13.167 align:middle line:84%
I ended up going
to a GI specialist

00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:15.933 align:middle line:90%
out here in Rhode Island.

00:22:15.933 --> 00:22:18.467 align:middle line:84%
And she said that
she was starting

00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
to do these fecal transplants.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> FMT stands for Fecal
Microbiota Transplant.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.933 align:middle line:84%
It means taking the microbes
from someone who's healthy

00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:33.933 align:middle line:84%
and transferring them over
to someone who's sick.

00:22:33.933 --> 00:22:39.333 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the only way to do
this is by using their poop.

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
The idea that giving somebody
poop could cure their illness

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:90%
is a pretty amazing thought.

00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But more than half of poop
is actually living microbes.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.867 align:middle line:84%
So fecal transplant
provides a patient

00:22:53.867 --> 00:22:56.033 align:middle line:84%
a wide range of
microbes intended

00:22:56.033 --> 00:22:59.067 align:middle line:84%
to restore balance in
the gut and to cure

00:22:59.067 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
the C-diff infection.

00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I used my daughter
as the donor.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:90%
She was 15.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.533 align:middle line:90%
Eew!

00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:09.567 align:middle line:90%
Mom, Eew!

00:23:09.567 --> 00:23:11.667 align:middle line:84%
The day of the procedure,
I was so afraid

00:23:11.667 --> 00:23:13.667 align:middle line:84%
she wouldn't be able
to use the bathroom.

00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:16.567 align:middle line:84%
So I loaded her up
with milk of magnesia.

00:23:16.567 --> 00:23:20.967 align:middle line:84%
So she came home from school
and she's like, mom, I

00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:24.667 align:middle line:90%
was in the bathroom all day.

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:28.067 align:middle line:90%
So she was not happy.

00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I would go in and I would do
kind of like a colonoscopy.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So they would liquefy the feces
and go up through the anus

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.733 align:middle line:84%
and into the intestinal tract
and kind of just with a syringe

00:23:38.733 --> 00:23:41.867 align:middle line:90%
push all that fluid in.

00:23:41.867 --> 00:23:47.767 align:middle line:84%
And like this, it
was instant relief.

00:23:47.767 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> FMT is a complex mixture,
and we don't even know what all

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.633 align:middle line:90%
the components are.

00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:56.333 align:middle line:84%
It's FDA approved only to
treat C-diff infections,

00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:59.733 align:middle line:84%
but for that, it's
very effective.

00:23:59.733 --> 00:24:03.767 align:middle line:84%
The benefit of it is much
greater than the risk.

00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:04.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, honey.

00:24:04.567 --> 00:24:05.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, babe.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Honey, you didn't have
to do this on your day off.

00:24:14.367 --> 00:24:17.233 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love it.

00:24:17.233 --> 00:24:20.767 align:middle line:84%
About six months after
I had the procedure,

00:24:20.767 --> 00:24:23.067 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing
a weight gain.

00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:27.100 align:middle line:90%
So this one here was 2005.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.967 align:middle line:84%
And then this one
was me in 2006.

00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:32.967 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the best one.

00:24:32.967 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's his favorite.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is me literally
right before the FMT.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.867 align:middle line:90%
And then this is me--

00:24:42.867 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:90%
it was like six months later.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.767 align:middle line:84%
So I went from being 120
pounds like my whole life to--

00:24:50.767 --> 00:24:52.467 align:middle line:90%
at my highest, I was 183.

00:24:52.467 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:10%
So I put on 60 pounds
within like a year.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.767 align:middle line:84%
And nothing had
changed in my life.

00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'm like,
why is this increase

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:90%
in weight gain happening?

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.467 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
made sense to me

00:25:06.467 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:90%
was the FMT procedure caused it.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.933 align:middle line:90%
More mice.

00:25:15.933 --> 00:25:18.433 align:middle line:84%
We did another experiment
where we took mice

00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
that we made fat
with antibiotics,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and we gave their
microbes to mice that

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.033 align:middle line:90%
had no microbes of their own.

00:25:26.033 --> 00:25:29.133 align:middle line:90%
And those mice got fat too.

00:25:29.133 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And that showed us that
the altered microbes

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.867 align:middle line:90%
were causing the weight gain.

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>> My daughter, she is obese.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.867 align:middle line:84%
She's shaped-- we're shaped
just like each other, round.

00:25:42.867 --> 00:25:45.067 align:middle line:84%
So looking at my
daughter's body,

00:25:45.067 --> 00:25:50.033 align:middle line:84%
and my body had to
have been from the FMT.

00:25:50.033 --> 00:25:51.467 align:middle line:90%
How was school?

00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:52.967 align:middle line:90%
Where's my love?

00:25:52.967 --> 00:25:55.167 align:middle line:90%
Give me my love.

00:25:55.167 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I've done Weight Watchers.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I did a liquid diet that's
done through Miriam Hospital.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.933 align:middle line:84%
So it's like medically
done with doctors.

00:26:02.933 --> 00:26:05.267 align:middle line:90%
I've tried so many diets.

00:26:05.267 --> 00:26:06.067 align:middle line:90%
I'm active.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.967 align:middle line:90%
I don't binge eat.

00:26:11.967 --> 00:26:14.333 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's
frustrating when I'm

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:16.667 align:middle line:84%
doing everything I can
to try to lose the weight

00:26:16.667 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and I still can't
lose the weight.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Several years ago, the
first project that we did was

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:10%
on artificial sweeteners.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.967 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story
short, what we showed

00:26:30.967 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is that consumption of
artificial sweeteners

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.067 align:middle line:84%
can alter the microbiome
in a detrimental way.

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:40.133 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the--
big, massive bell.

00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:40.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:41.833 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:44.067 align:middle line:90%
>> So microbiome and diet.

00:26:44.067 --> 00:26:46.867 align:middle line:84%
How did you first get
involved in this field?

00:26:46.867 --> 00:26:51.433 align:middle line:84%
>> I got into reading about
diet for marathon running.

00:26:51.433 --> 00:26:55.233 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that a
lot of the things that people

00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:57.633 align:middle line:84%
tell us you should
eat for training

00:26:57.633 --> 00:26:59.067 align:middle line:90%
have no scientific basis.

00:26:59.067 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:08.367 --> 00:27:11.233 align:middle line:84%
When I started reading about
nutrition and thinking about

00:27:11.233 --> 00:27:14.333 align:middle line:84%
differences between people, I
realized that everything you

00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:19.067 align:middle line:84%
put in your body has an effect
on your gut bacteria and that

00:27:19.067 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:84%
our gut bacteria may really have
a dominant role in all these

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:26.533 align:middle line:84%
big questions I was asking,
like why some of us become obese

00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:29.333 align:middle line:84%
or develop diabetes
while others don't.

00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I was performing
colonoscopies and endoscopies

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:90%
every day of the week.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.267 align:middle line:84%
I was meeting the
microbiome on a daily basis,

00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:51.567 align:middle line:84%
but at that time, we all thought
that this was a waste product,

00:27:51.567 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that it was just something
that we had to live with

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
but was not really
important to our physiology

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.267 align:middle line:90%
or to our health.

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:05.467 align:middle line:84%
But as we matured as
a field, we realized

00:28:05.467 --> 00:28:10.467 align:middle line:84%
that the functions these
microbes provide are important.

00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:15.233 align:middle line:84%
And this was a conceptual
change in the field.

00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:19.267 align:middle line:84%
I do microbiome
research while my wife

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:21.867 align:middle line:84%
is an infectious
disease specialist.

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.933 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
discussions over dinner

00:28:23.933 --> 00:28:30.267 align:middle line:84%
related to human excretions
that are not entirely proper.

00:28:30.267 --> 00:28:32.667 align:middle line:84%
>> I brought you a new
sample for the study.

00:28:32.667 --> 00:28:35.567 align:middle line:84%
>> In many cases,
my kids tell me,

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:38.467 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to hear any more
about your work, your science,

00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:39.267 align:middle line:90%
and about poop.

00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:45.467 align:middle line:84%
>> We thought that
working together,

00:28:45.467 --> 00:28:47.467 align:middle line:84%
it could lead to
something very fruitful.

00:28:47.467 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Fresh strawberries!

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.833 align:middle line:84%
>> The first idea was
related to nutrition.

00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:59.267 align:middle line:10%
I often met patients suffering
of obesity, of type 2 diabetes.

00:28:59.267 --> 00:29:03.333 align:middle line:10%
I always gave the gold standard
recommendations, the American

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:10%
Heart Association and American
Diabetes Association diets,

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.867 align:middle line:10%
but the nutritional
recommendations in reality

00:29:08.867 --> 00:29:13.667 align:middle line:10%
never really worked for
most of these individuals.

00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:16.767 align:middle line:84%
>> We began to wonder if these
diets failed because they were

00:29:16.767 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
ignoring the role gut microbes
play in how we digest our food

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.833 align:middle line:84%
and how every person has
different microbes inside them.

00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:31.733 align:middle line:84%
>> We'd asked 1,000 individuals
to give us a week of his or her

00:29:31.733 --> 00:29:33.033 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:35.633 align:middle line:84%
We collected lots
of information.

00:29:38.233 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They were giving us blood
tests in which we measured

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.200 align:middle line:90%
many different parameters.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> For dozens of different
small and large meals,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.267 align:middle line:90%
you log everything that you eat.

00:29:48.267 --> 00:29:50.733 align:middle line:84%
>> And we took stool samples
from each of these individuals

00:29:50.733 --> 00:29:53.867 align:middle line:84%
in order to characterize
their gut microbes,

00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
their composition,
their function,

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.467 align:middle line:84%
their genomic content,
and many other features.

00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:06.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Crunching all this data, we
created a program that could

00:30:06.533 --> 00:30:09.733 align:middle line:84%
identify which foods made each
person's blood sugar levels

00:30:09.733 --> 00:30:14.133 align:middle line:84%
rise and which brought
them back to normal.

00:30:14.133 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:84%
We also learned
that the way foods

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:84%
are paired is very important
for avoiding sugar spikes.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.267 align:middle line:84%
For instance, bread
may be bad for someone,

00:30:22.267 --> 00:30:24.633 align:middle line:84%
but not when they
combine it with butter.

00:30:24.633 --> 00:30:26.967 align:middle line:84%
Or an apple may
cause sugar spikes,

00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:30.667 align:middle line:84%
but not when they
eat it with walnuts.

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:32.867 align:middle line:84%
We then designed
personalized diets

00:30:32.867 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
for participants
with pre-diabetes

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.333 align:middle line:90%
based on their gut microbes.

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:40.333 align:middle line:84%
And the results were
actually quite remarkable.

00:30:40.333 --> 00:30:42.633 align:middle line:84%
We were able for almost
all of these participants

00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:46.133 align:middle line:84%
to fully normalize to perfectly
healthy their blood glucose

00:30:46.133 --> 00:30:47.267 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:50.833 align:middle line:84%
And as a happy side effect,
they also lost about 10 pounds

00:30:50.833 --> 00:30:54.333 align:middle line:90%
on average over 6 months.

00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:57.467 align:middle line:84%
And when we analyzed the
changes in the gut bacteria,

00:30:57.467 --> 00:31:00.733 align:middle line:84%
we were able to detect shifts
in the microbiome following

00:31:00.733 --> 00:31:02.833 align:middle line:90%
these dietary interventions.

00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:05.533 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria associated
with diabetes

00:31:05.533 --> 00:31:08.733 align:middle line:84%
tended, on average, to go
down in their levels in most

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:90%
participants.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.367 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps their gut
bacteria may be

00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:84%
changing to a more
beneficial composition.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.900 align:middle line:84%
That, of course,
needs to be verified

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in longer term trials, which we
are actually engaged in today.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.633 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we have a great
opportunity to pinpoint which

00:31:26.633 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:84%
are the bacteria inside this
huge neighborhood of bacteria

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that resides within us that are
actually doing the good stuff.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.733 align:middle line:84%
And this, in the
future, could actually

00:31:36.733 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
mean that we may have a
capability in complementing

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.933 align:middle line:84%
the dietary approach with next
generation probiotics that

00:31:44.933 --> 00:31:49.633 align:middle line:84%
are actually able to drive
normalizing blood sugar levels

00:31:49.633 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and even reducing weight.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an important goal
because many of the probiotics

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that are actually in use today
haven't really been vetted

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:90%
by science.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Some people experience
real benefits,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.233 align:middle line:10%
but most are untested.

00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
What Eran Elinav calls
next generation probiotics

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.867 align:middle line:84%
I call targeted
probiotics, the idea

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:16.400 align:middle line:84%
that we could use specific
bacteria for specific purposes.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.867 align:middle line:84%
Such bacteria could provide
answers for other health issues

00:32:19.867 --> 00:32:22.633 align:middle line:84%
that currently don't have
great treatment options.

00:32:29.433 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You see him get it I remember
having to go to birthday

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.233 align:middle line:84%
parties and having to miss
out on pizza, the cake,

00:32:40.233 --> 00:32:43.233 align:middle line:84%
maybe ice cream, and I would
have to bring my own things.

00:32:45.967 --> 00:32:48.267 align:middle line:84%
>> He was having a
difficult time eating,

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:51.867 align:middle line:84%
even right at birth
in the hospital.

00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:53.567 align:middle line:84%
It was tough to
keep anything down

00:32:53.567 --> 00:32:56.667 align:middle line:84%
and he would just
projectile vomit.

00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:59.167 align:middle line:84%
And his face almost
completely swelled up.

00:32:59.167 --> 00:33:01.167 align:middle line:90%
His eyes swelled shut.

00:33:01.167 --> 00:33:03.833 align:middle line:84%
He would have tears
rolling down his eyes.

00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:09.433 align:middle line:84%
But that was before we knew that
he was a truly allergic kid.

00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Nuts, milk, wheat, soy,
sesame, pretty much everything,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.167 align:middle line:90%
it feels like.

00:33:16.167 --> 00:33:20.333 align:middle line:84%
Your mouth starts to tingle
and feels really bad.

00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:22.733 align:middle line:84%
And then your body
starts getting all lumpy.

00:33:22.733 --> 00:33:26.133 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts bleeding
from like all the bumpy hives.

00:33:26.133 --> 00:33:28.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not a good--
pretty sight at all.

00:33:33.667 --> 00:33:37.967 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time I got the
call they were in the ambulance,

00:33:37.967 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:90%
that was hard.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Stuck at work.

00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:45.733 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll never forget this.

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:47.067 align:middle line:90%
I remembered this the other day.

00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:50.633 align:middle line:84%
It was probably one
of the worst days.

00:33:50.633 --> 00:33:54.767 align:middle line:84%
He was about five or
six, and he was crying.

00:33:54.767 --> 00:33:57.333 align:middle line:84%
And you can just kind of
see this light bulb go off

00:33:57.333 --> 00:33:58.133 align:middle line:90%
in his head.

00:33:58.133 --> 00:34:03.867 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm never going to
get better, this is how I am,

00:34:03.867 --> 00:34:05.733 align:middle line:84%
and it's never
going to get better,

00:34:05.733 --> 00:34:09.033 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to be
like everybody else.

00:34:09.033 --> 00:34:10.867 align:middle line:90%
And he was just crying.

00:34:10.867 --> 00:34:13.533 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why did
God do this to me?

00:34:17.467 --> 00:34:18.333 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:19.433 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing for him.

00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:22.033 align:middle line:84%
And every day he
seemed to get worse.

00:34:25.267 --> 00:34:28.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Food allergy is a condition
in which there is a change

00:34:28.867 --> 00:34:31.633 align:middle line:84%
in the immune system in
the gut and also a change

00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:33.533 align:middle line:90%
in the microbiome.

00:34:33.533 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
My lab has shown that
children with food allergy

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:84%
have bacterial microbes that
are different from those

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.600 align:middle line:90%
of healthy children.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.700 align:middle line:84%
We found that one
bacterium in particular

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
called subdoligranulum variabile
were either severely depleted

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.133 align:middle line:84%
or missing in children
with food allergy

00:34:52.133 --> 00:34:57.767 align:middle line:84%
and that this bacterium
protects against food allergy.

00:34:57.767 --> 00:35:02.167 align:middle line:84%
So in mice, treatment with this
bacterium cures food allergy.

00:35:06.233 --> 00:35:09.533 align:middle line:84%
We should be able to translate
these results to therapies

00:35:09.533 --> 00:35:13.367 align:middle line:90%
for people with food allergy.

00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:15.567 align:middle line:84%
Can this happen in
the next decade?

00:35:15.567 --> 00:35:16.967 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:16.967 --> 00:35:18.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Here you go, bud.

00:35:18.433 --> 00:35:21.467 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you.

00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:25.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, the magnitude of
the problem is so huge that we

00:35:25.533 --> 00:35:30.067 align:middle line:84%
have to investigate alternative
approaches to therapy such

00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:33.867 align:middle line:84%
as giving small amounts of
the allergic foods to build up

00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:34.667 align:middle line:90%
tolerance.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.433 align:middle line:90%
>> There they are.

00:35:39.433 --> 00:35:40.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:41.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, guys.

00:35:41.033 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Amy.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.333 align:middle line:90%
>> How was your week?

00:35:43.333 --> 00:35:44.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:35:44.133 --> 00:35:45.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on in.

00:35:45.467 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Amy Thieringer.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I am an innovative
Nutritionist and Health Coach.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:57.667 align:middle line:84%
My goal and my mission is to
help as many kids as I can.

00:35:57.667 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Pick a movie.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.267 align:middle line:84%
Any environmental
stuff this week, Ruby?

00:36:02.267 --> 00:36:04.867 align:middle line:84%
>> He just sneezed a couple
of times, mostly just sniffy.

00:36:04.867 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.667 align:middle line:84%
It's really difficult
preparing yourself to start

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:11.767 align:middle line:90%
having exposure to the food.

00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:84%
They watch a video
because I don't want them

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.133 align:middle line:90%
thinking about what I'm doing.

00:36:15.133 --> 00:36:18.867 align:middle line:84%
And I put a poppy seed-sized
speck on their chin.

00:36:18.867 --> 00:36:22.267 align:middle line:84%
And I leave it on there for
2 minutes and all is well.

00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:23.767 align:middle line:84%
The next time they
come in, I put it

00:36:23.767 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:90%
on the middle of their lip.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.100 align:middle line:90%
And then they will lick it.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.667 align:middle line:84%
And they do it at home every
day and they increase the amount

00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:32.467 align:middle line:90%
very slowly.

00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:38.967 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do three
tabs of the cashews.

00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They are so anxious
about these foods

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.633 align:middle line:84%
that they go into
this heightened state

00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:48.333 align:middle line:84%
and they can have a full
blown anaphylactic reaction.

00:36:48.333 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So we give them tools to help
calm that anxiety response.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.933 align:middle line:84%
OK, and if he gets a little
nervous, we do our tapping

00:36:57.933 --> 00:36:59.533 align:middle line:90%
and say our mantra.

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:01.433 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Amy taught
you a new mantra?

00:37:01.433 --> 00:37:03.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:37:03.533 --> 00:37:04.433 align:middle line:90%
I am safe.

00:37:04.433 --> 00:37:05.233 align:middle line:90%
I am happy.

00:37:05.233 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:90%
I am free.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:06.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.467 align:middle line:90%
I'm free.

00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:09.267 align:middle line:90%
I am safe.

00:37:09.267 --> 00:37:09.867 align:middle line:90%
I am happy.

00:37:09.867 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I am free.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I am safe.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:11.967 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:12.800 align:middle line:90%
I am free.

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:17.667 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It's really difficult, but
just to see where he started

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.033 align:middle line:90%
and where he is right now.

00:37:35.033 --> 00:37:35.833 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:37:35.833 --> 00:37:37.967 align:middle line:84%
Five months ago you had
cashews and we ended up

00:37:37.967 --> 00:37:39.700 align:middle line:90%
in the hospital.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.733 align:middle line:90%
Now look at him.

00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:90%
He's had three cashews.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Using small amounts of
allergic foods to build up

00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:84%
tolerance is effective in
decreasing allergic reactions,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.433 align:middle line:84%
but in most cases,
it's not a cure.

00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:56.867 align:middle line:84%
But the important
thing is that we

00:37:56.867 --> 00:37:59.433 align:middle line:84%
can use the gut
microbes to retrain

00:37:59.433 --> 00:38:03.067 align:middle line:84%
the immune system of
patients with food allergies.

00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:90%
¿Adriana, do you love me?

00:38:11.267 --> 00:38:14.533 align:middle line:84%

00:48:26.467 --> 00:48:28.633 align:middle line:90%
multiply.

00:48:28.633 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And this can make the antibiotic
less likely to work next time.

00:48:36.867 --> 00:48:40.133 align:middle line:84%
>> 70% to 80% of all the
antibiotics used in the United

00:48:40.133 --> 00:48:44.433 align:middle line:84%
States are used on the farm,
and our meat is a little cheaper

00:48:44.433 --> 00:48:47.267 align:middle line:84%
as a result. But
there's a disadvantage.

00:48:47.267 --> 00:48:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Those animals are carrying
resistant bacteria,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.633 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
evidence that these now

00:48:53.633 --> 00:48:55.900 align:middle line:84%
are being transferred
over to people.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Drug-resistant diseases claim
the lives of around 700,000

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.800 align:middle line:90%
people each year.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.733 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's expected to
leap to 10 million by 2050.

00:49:04.733 --> 00:49:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Compare that with today's
deaths from cancer, 8.2 million

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.000 align:middle line:90%
each year.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.633 align:middle line:10%
>> Antibiotic resistance is one
of the biggest health threats

00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:16.100 align:middle line:10%
we have around the world.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.733 align:middle line:84%
The COVID pandemic
has been devastating,

00:49:19.733 --> 00:49:23.533 align:middle line:84%
but a pandemic of drug-resistant
bacteria could be even worse.

00:49:23.533 --> 00:49:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It could sweep through the
population just like COVID-19.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's what I've called
antibiotic winter.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.767 align:middle line:84%
You remember those
Roadrunner cartoons

00:49:33.767 --> 00:49:36.067 align:middle line:84%
where they're racing
along the plateau

00:49:36.067 --> 00:49:38.067 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that
there's a cliff ahead?

00:49:38.067 --> 00:49:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're wondering, when
are they going to slow down

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.933 align:middle line:84%
or are they going to
go over the cliff?

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I was appointed to chair
the President's Advisory

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.767 align:middle line:84%
Council to combat antibiotic
resistance bacteria.

00:50:01.767 --> 00:50:04.533 align:middle line:84%
And our mandate is
to provide advice

00:50:04.533 --> 00:50:06.867 align:middle line:84%
to the Secretary of
Health and Human Services

00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:08.533 align:middle line:84%
to the President of
the United States

00:50:08.533 --> 00:50:12.667 align:middle line:84%
about how to control
antibiotic resistance.

00:50:12.667 --> 00:50:17.767 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an opportunity to tackle
a big problem that is big now

00:50:17.767 --> 00:50:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and threatens to become
much worse unless we can do

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.100 align:middle line:90%
something about it.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.400 align:middle line:90%
My name is Alicia Cole.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.267 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a survivor of
sepsis pseudomonas,

00:50:27.267 --> 00:50:31.167 align:middle line:84%
MRSA, VRE, and
necrotizing fasciitis.

00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:33.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Alicia contracted
those deadly bacteria,

00:50:33.867 --> 00:50:36.667 align:middle line:84%
as so many people
do, in the hospital.

00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:39.233 align:middle line:84%
After the infection
started, the antibiotics

00:50:39.233 --> 00:50:41.600 align:middle line:84%
they gave her couldn't
stop its spread.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.633 align:middle line:84%
The infection was spreading
about an inch every hour.

00:50:46.633 --> 00:50:53.033 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt that kind
of pain ever in my life.

00:50:53.033 --> 00:50:55.933 align:middle line:84%
Many people don't
survive battles

00:50:55.933 --> 00:50:59.033 align:middle line:90%
with antibiotic-resistant bugs.

00:50:59.033 --> 00:51:00.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm so lucky.

00:51:04.733 --> 00:51:07.533 align:middle line:84%
>> All of modern medicine is
based on having antibiotics

00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:08.400 align:middle line:90%
that work.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.667 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have antibiotics
that work, surgery becomes

00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:15.300 align:middle line:84%
too risky, transplantation
becomes too risky,

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.933 align:middle line:90%
chemotherapy becomes too risky.

00:51:17.933 --> 00:51:20.667 align:middle line:84%
And if they stop working
because of resistance,

00:51:20.667 --> 00:51:22.867 align:middle line:90%
all these things go away.

00:51:22.867 --> 00:51:27.533 align:middle line:84%
The solution is that we have to
steward our antibiotics better.

00:51:27.533 --> 00:51:30.367 align:middle line:84%
We have to use them
only when they're needed

00:51:30.367 --> 00:51:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and not when they're not.

00:51:39.167 --> 00:51:41.567 align:middle line:10%
We have to devote
sufficient resources

00:51:41.567 --> 00:51:43.967 align:middle line:10%
to deal with this problem,
not just in the US,

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:45.600 align:middle line:10%
but everywhere in the world.

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.467 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the goals
of the Advisory Council.

00:51:48.467 --> 00:51:52.967 align:middle line:84%
>> I remind everybody that
microbes do not respect

>> 60,000 newborns a year in
India die from drug-resistant

00:52:00.067 --> 00:52:04.767 align:middle line:10%
infections as one antibiotic
after another has failed.

00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:07.533 align:middle line:10%
>> Drug-resistant forms of
diseases are on the rise

00:52:07.533 --> 00:52:11.667 align:middle line:10%
in China because of the
overuse of antibiotics.

00:52:11.667 --> 00:52:14.467 align:middle line:84%
>> As much as we're using
antibiotics in the US,

00:52:14.467 --> 00:52:18.200 align:middle line:84%
in China, they're using them
about five times more per

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.133 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:52:19.133 --> 00:52:22.133 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:52:22.133 --> 00:52:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, here we go.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:24.700 align:middle line:90%
You got your bag?

00:52:34.167 --> 00:52:38.233 align:middle line:84%
>> If we got all of our ducks
in a row and we really cut down

00:52:38.233 --> 00:52:41.800 align:middle line:84%
on antibiotic use, because
of the enormous use in other

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.700 align:middle line:84%
countries, especially in
Asia, we'd still be vulnerable

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.933 align:middle line:90%
to superbugs.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:55.600 align:middle line:90%

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.400 align:middle line:90%

00:53:00.167 --> 00:53:02.333 align:middle line:84%
When Marty's book
arrived in China,

00:53:02.367 --> 00:53:04.700 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:53:04.933 --> 00:53:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I felt the need
to raise awareness

00:53:07.233 --> 00:53:08.833 align:middle line:90%
about our disappearing microbes.

00:53:09.633 --> 00:53:12.567 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are starting
to accept this theory

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.667 align:middle line:90%
and understand the consequences.

much, Mr. Gut.

00:53:21.133 --> 00:53:23.267 align:middle line:84%
I'm very happy to
be here in China.

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:27.367 align:middle line:84%
So today, I talk about
our missing microbes.

00:53:27.367 --> 00:53:29.967 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
many causes, but I'm

00:53:29.967 --> 00:53:33.200 align:middle line:84%
going to highlight just
one, and that's antibiotics.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Colleagues of mine from China
tell me that when they were

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.533 align:middle line:84%
growing up and they
had a headache,

00:53:37.533 --> 00:53:40.133 align:middle line:84%
their mom would take them to
the pharmacy and they would get

00:53:40.133 --> 00:53:43.500 align:middle line:84%
an antibiotic because the idea
was then an antibiotic could

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.733 align:middle line:90%
treat anything.

00:53:45.733 --> 00:53:47.933 align:middle line:84%
This overuse of
antibiotics in China

00:53:47.933 --> 00:53:51.033 align:middle line:84%
came at a time of other
big impacts to our bugs

00:53:51.033 --> 00:53:54.433 align:middle line:84%
like eating rich and
fatty foods, more meat,

00:53:54.433 --> 00:53:57.767 align:middle line:84%
and moving off of
farms and into cities.

00:53:57.767 --> 00:54:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And just like what happened in
the US some decades earlier,

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.333 align:middle line:84%
China soon had
dramatic increases

00:54:03.333 --> 00:54:07.833 align:middle line:84%
in obesity and other
chronic illnesses.

00:54:07.833 --> 00:54:10.033 align:middle line:84%
>> So when the mother
takes antibiotics,

00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:12.167 align:middle line:90%
she's changing her microbiota.

00:54:12.167 --> 00:54:15.333 align:middle line:84%
She might be affecting the
fetus because of the changes.

00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:19.367 align:middle line:84%
>> The C-section rate
in China is about 50%.

00:54:19.367 --> 00:54:23.200 align:middle line:84%
That's very high and
could be another factor

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.700 align:middle line:84%
in their skyrocketing
disease rates.

00:54:27.533 --> 00:54:31.133 align:middle line:84%
You've written about using
vaginal swabs after C-sections.

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:33.567 align:middle line:84%
What percentage
of U.S. hospitals

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.667 align:middle line:90%
are using this practice?

00:54:35.833 --> 00:54:41.133 align:middle line:84%
>> No hospital are doing it
because we don't know that it

00:54:41.133 --> 00:54:45.400 align:middle line:84%
protects the babies against
the risks associated with

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.300 align:middle line:90%

There's a growing body of work
about autism, of the diseases

that affect the brain.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.667 align:middle line:84%
That's the one I'm most
interested in because autism

00:55:59.667 --> 00:56:01.433 align:middle line:90%
is a disease of early life.

00:56:01.433 --> 00:56:03.967 align:middle line:84%
It has to be forming
in early life.

00:56:03.967 --> 00:56:09.467 align:middle line:10%
And the rate of autism
has gone up tremendously.

00:56:09.467 --> 00:56:10.400 align:middle line:10%
It's not genes.

Our genes haven't changed,
but something environmental

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.933 align:middle line:10%
has changed.

00:56:13.933 --> 00:56:16.067 align:middle line:84%
And I think the main
environmental thing

00:56:16.067 --> 00:56:19.333 align:middle line:90%
is the microbiome.

00:56:19.333 --> 00:56:21.000 align:middle line:90%
We know it's a two-way street.

Your mood and your anxiety
influence your gut.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.433 align:middle line:84%
And now we know more and
more that events in the gut

00:56:27.433 --> 00:56:32.133 align:middle line:84%
influence the brain, especially
as driven by microbes.

00:56:32.133 --> 00:56:36.133 align:middle line:84%
For example, gut microbes affect
cells in the intestinal wall

00:56:36.133 --> 00:56:38.367 align:middle line:90%
that make serotonin.

00:56:38.367 --> 00:56:40.533 align:middle line:84%
And that's involved
in brain development

00:56:40.533 --> 00:56:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and also helps
regulate emotions.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.500 align:middle line:84%
We call this interplay
the gut-brain axis.

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.067 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
number of other people

00:56:49.067 --> 00:56:50.667 align:middle line:84%

contribute to the rise

00:57:03.967 --> 00:57:06.333 align:middle line:90%
We believe so, yes.

Three months into my pregnancy,

the microbiome
is to development,

In the spring of 2015,

00:58:05.233 --> 00:58:09.867 align:middle line:84%
my son received his first

A few hours after the procedure,

00:58:15.233 --> 00:58:18.200 align:middle line:90%
he showed obvious improvements.

my research on gut microbes.

Actually,
even in the olden days,

00:58:27.633 --> 00:58:30.733 align:middle line:84%

was a mixture
of fecal bacteria and urine.

So we ask ourselves, how do
we restore what we've lost?

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:33.867 align:middle line:84%

brings us closer and closer

01:21:33.867 --> 01:21:34.733 align:middle line:90%
to the answers.
