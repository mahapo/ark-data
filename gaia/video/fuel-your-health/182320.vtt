but yeah, we basically

lived a very kind of

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We lived about 10 minutes
from my maternal grandparents,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and they featured very
strongly in our lives.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And my grandma was a
wonderful gardener.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:90%
She always had vegetables.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
She just had this way of
taking me out as a child

into the garden
and making it seem

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:90%
very magical and wonderful.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So she's definitely a
huge influence in my life,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:90%
and was a great cook.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And she would
always put whatever

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.008 align:middle line:84%
was left over from
the roast into a pot

00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and she would make broth.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
And that smell,
particularly in her house,

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
was a smell that I
associate with the house.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I think things like making
broth, I'm a real advocate for.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And people say to me,
well, why don't you

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.338 align:middle line:84%
just start your own broth
business and sell it?

00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:84%
You can get so much
money selling it.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.037 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, for
me, that's great.

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
doing that, and they're

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.745 align:middle line:84%
charging, in my opinion,
way too much for it.

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But really, truthfully,
I'd like to teach people

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:90%
to make it if it's so easy.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%

There's a majority of people
in this country are not well.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to get out
there and heal people.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
My journey's been one that I
would have never predicted.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
It's part of that
mystery of life.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a traditionally-trained
nephrologist,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:90%
kidney specialist.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:10%
I trained at Mass
General Hospital,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:10%
and I spent most of
really the first half

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:10%
of my professional life
doing that and loving

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:10%
what I did in that capacity.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And then a horrible sort
of coincidence happened.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Both my parents
developed kidney failure

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:90%
and ended up on dialysis.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
They suffered terribly and
they died at young ages,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and it was an epiphany for me.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what they went
through was preventable.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get a lot
of help with nutrition.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:84%
At that time in my
life, I began to realize

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:90%
I needed to think differently.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.027 align:middle line:10%
>> So I'm an internal
medicine doc,

00:05:51.027 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:10%
and just at the time that I
was coming to the University

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:10%
of Iowa in the VA, I was
diagnosed with multiple

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:10%
sclerosis on the basis of
weakness of my left leg

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.087 align:middle line:10%
and a prior history of
dimness in the left eye.

00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Like many physicians, when
you're first diagnosed,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:90%
you do all this reading.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
upsetting because MS

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:90%
is a progressive disease.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Within three years,
I had converted

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to secondary progressive
MS. Now in that stage,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:84%
there's no more
spontaneous improvement.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
You expect just
a steady decline.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:90%
At the very end of the year.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I have this new
a-ha moment, like I

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:84%
should focus on what is
it that my brain needs,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and redesign my diet
very specifically

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
to get the nutrition that
I'm taking in supplement form

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:90%
from my food.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the magic happens.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I had to learn all of the
things that a good American

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Medical education
did not provide me.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
I went on to get
training in many

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:90%
of these other disciplines.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I began applying
them in my own life.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see
my own life shift.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So at three months,
my brain fog is gone.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:90%
My energy's up.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this new clinic, and
actually, I can do the work.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:90%
I can see these patients.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm not exhausted.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.017 align:middle line:84%
And at nine months, I decide
I'm going to go for a bike ride.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:90%
My family's sort of freaked out.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:84%
We're having this big family
meeting, and my kids are upset.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid because I
haven't biked in six years.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.587 align:middle line:90%
And Jackie says, OK.

00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a try.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And she has my son jog on the
left, my daughter on the right.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:90%
She's behind on the bike.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
She waits for the all
clear, and then I push off.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:90%
And I make it.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:90%
I can pedal around the block.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I just don't write
prescriptions anymore.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.165 align:middle line:90%
I look at lifestyle.

00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
people who come to me

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
are people who've
kind of hit the wall.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
They've had the best of what our
traditional models can offer,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
but they've only been able to
move so far in those models.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.780 align:middle line:84%
What my parents
went through really

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
changed the way that
I think about who I am

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:90%
and how I serve others.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful
for that journey.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Had this not happened, I
would still be a conventional,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
academic doc thinking
the newest drugs,

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
latest surgery was where
everything's at, as opposed

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
to a doc that understands what
really matters is the quality

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of the diet that my
patients are eating,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
their environmental
exposures to chemicals,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:84%
their social network, their
stress management practices,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:90%
their daily movement.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:90%
That is the root of health.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people have
unfortunately focused

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
on the potentially pathogenic
microbes on the farm--

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:90%
E. coli, salmonella.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at things
from a 30,000-foot level,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
this is a sea of
beneficial microbes.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:84%
You have everything here
you could ever imagine.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.165 align:middle line:84%
And whether you're
petting an animal

00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
or you're drinking the
raw milk of an animal,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
you're requiring just
an incredible amount

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
of microbial diversity
from that exposure.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that's
important is with cows,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
they need a really
high volume of roughage

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:84%
because the microbes in the
ruminant's digestive track

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
are-- it's like
the gold standard.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to find a
better example in biology

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of where an am animal
can convert fiber

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
to short-chain
fatty acids or fats.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:10%
That cow is on a fat-based
diet for the most part.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And people find that hard
to believe because they look

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
at the hay and they're thinking,
fiber and carbohydrates,

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's mostly fiber,
and they really need that.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And then all the microbes in
some of the distal chambers

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
of their digestive
tract are going

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
to convert all that fiber
to fat before it gets

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:90%
absorbed into their system.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's an incredible model
for the ultimate in microbiome.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.188 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a really healthy
looking poop right there.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Who knew our poop
could be so valuable?

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
That the microbiome, the
bacteria living in our bowels,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:90%
have 9 million genes?

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
We've got 25,000 at most, and
our bacteria have 9 million.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And those 9 million genes help
us run the chemistry of life.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:10%
>> We also have this incredible
microbiome that lives

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:10%
in the gut, which is all
different kinds of organisms

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:10%
from bacteria, to viruses,
to fungi, to you name it,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:10%
that populate the gut and make
up about three to five pounds

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:10%
of our body weight.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
These organisms are
regulating our immune systems

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
because they're in constant
conversation with our body

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:90%
and with our brain.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been studying for
many, many years how microbes

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:10%
interact with us, and in which
terms they have this crosstalk.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:10%
And the only thing
that we have been

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:10%
able to do until
the recent past is

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.695 align:middle line:10%
to study specifically these
microbes that we can cultivate.

00:11:17.695 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, that can be
physically seen on a petri dish

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:90%
or under the microscope.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And only recently,
thanks to technologies

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't have
available before, we realized

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that we were looking
at 5% of what

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is the wealth of
microorganisms that we coexist.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We are whatever we are because
we are the component of us

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and this wealth of
ecosystem that live with us.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at you.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
video has for each cell

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
another 10 microorganisms that
are coexisting and cohabiting

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So most traditional
docs, like myself,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that I have really
good training,

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
you're taught to think about
human biology as distinct

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
systems that have these
autonomous effects on human

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.913 align:middle line:84%
We now see them as
tightly-integrated systems.

00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And the gut and the
brain, the nervous system,

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:84%
as it turns out, are really
one shared, integrated organ.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very
integrated system,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and so the way that I treat
people is actually to look

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
at their gut, to assess
their microbiome,

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to look how that's connected
to their immune system

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and their brain.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only way
that I'm able to really help

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
people with very complex
neurological problems.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
What's funny is that one of
my colleagues that I work with

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
said, I went into neurology
because I don't want

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:90%
to think about the other end.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, I don't know
how you can help people then

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:10%
because really to look
at complex issues,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:10%
it's true that all health
does begin in the gut.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We knew for a long time that
there was a crosstalk between

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:90%
the brain and the gut.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, when
you're stressed out or nervous,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
you can have
stomachache, or you can

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
have bowel movements changes,
and so on and so forth.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:84%
What we didn't
know, and now it's

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:84%
really flourish in
science, that this

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:90%
is a two-way communication.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The gut can
communicate the brain.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> For people who have issues
with depression or anxiety,

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
all you really have to do is
take a look at some of the most

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.035 align:middle line:84%
basic research on things like
yogurt and on fermented foods.

00:13:33.035 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:84%
There's an
interesting study that

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.230 align:middle line:84%
was done at UCLA where women
were given yogurt for two

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.472 align:middle line:84%
or three weeks, and they
had remarkably favorable

00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
improvements in their
outlook on things--

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:84%
less anxiety when they were
presented stressful pictures

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:90%
and photographs.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
unequivocal evidence

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that the gut has an enormous
control over the mind,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:90%
and maybe vice-versa.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The organisms in our gut
can help boost our cognition,

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
help us feel happier and less
anxious, help us sleep better.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So probably in the future,
we're going to really

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
be seeing a whole new
category of treatments

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.282 align:middle line:84%
that are going to come from
the microbiome of our guts

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:11.115 align:middle line:90%
to treat our brains.

00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> When I moved up here
2 and 1/2 years ago,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
actually before I moved up here,
I connected to Leslie and Derek

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:90%
who are the house managers.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And I basically worked
with them a little bit

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
when they came down to
Camphill and helped them

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
because they were very
interested in nutrition.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:90%
They came to a conference.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
They did my workshop
on fermentation.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
interested, and they really

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
wanted that to be a big part
of what High Spirit would be,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
would be that the young people,
the young residents there would

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.203 align:middle line:84%
eat well, but that they would be
part of cooking their own food,

00:14:55.203 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:90%
and sourcing their own food.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So they have grown
a beautiful garden.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have gone in there
to help them menu plan

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:90%
and cook with the youngsters.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The premise really is that
all disease begins in the gut,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
which Hypocrites said
back in ancient times--

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, the father of
medicine-- and that food

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
really is our medicine, and
look to food as the medicine.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we've got
so far away from that,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that I think that's what
we're sort of pulling back to.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was
really a discovery

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:84%
of this method of cooking
that that helped me heal,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and got me very
excited, and wanting

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.620 align:middle line:90%
to share that with others.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.652 align:middle line:84%
Nothing compares with coming
into somebody's kitchen,

00:15:40.652 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
or me going into
somebody else's kitchen,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
ideally, into their kitchen,
because it's where they are,

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and teaching them.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's really my
goal in these next years.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Really, my teaching
has always just

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
been in the doing it with
others and the conversation that

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:90%
transpires between people.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:90%
So what's new?

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.573 align:middle line:90%
What did you do yesterday?

00:16:00.573 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Unpacked.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you do?

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Unpacked.

00:16:03.655 --> 00:16:04.455 align:middle line:90%
>> You unpacked?

00:16:04.455 --> 00:16:05.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So are you all moved in?

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's awesome.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Do you like the new house?

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You do?

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.973 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are going to
have to get on board,

00:16:18.973 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to have to start

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:90%
looking at nutrition again.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The crazy thing in
medicine is when

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:84%
you're trained to be a doctor,
your nutrition education is

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.282 align:middle line:90%
sparse, to say the least.

00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't get a whole
lot on that, whereas it's

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:90%
like the whole thing.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way
that our bodies crave

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
diverse microorganisms,
and that constant exposure,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
our bodies also
crave diverse foods.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And so that means not
having your peanut butter

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and jelly sandwich
every day for lunch,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and your burger every
day for dinner, whatever

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
it is you usually do,
but really mixing it

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:84%
up, eating with the seasons,
trying lots of different foods.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And making sure, of course,
that a lot of them are plants.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I think an ideal guide for
most guts would be made up

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
of a significant amount of
fermentable fiber from a wide

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:90%
variety of vegetables.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Examples of those vegetables,
which I think feed

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the gut better than
any other, would

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
be things like leeks,
a variety of lettuces.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Romaine lettuce is
great for the gut.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even iceberg lettuce,
which quite often is dismissed

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:84%
as having no
nutritional value, when

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
you take a look at the type of
fiber found in all lettuces,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.823 align:middle line:84%
it's among the best for feeding
different organisms in the gut.

00:17:31.823 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I think you'd have
fermented foods quite often

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:90%
at those same meals.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And then root vegetables,
things like carrots,

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:84%
beets, parsnips, sweet
potatoes, of course.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.697 align:middle line:84%
Some of these being a little
undercooked or raw at times

00:17:42.697 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
would give us some of that
resistant starch, which

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
would feed a wide
variety of microbes,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.100 align:middle line:84%
thereby fostering
that diversity.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a much, much longer
history as a species eating

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
vegetables, eating
roots, leaves,

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:84%
berries that didn't have
a lot of starch in them.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:90%
They had a lot of fiber in them.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And so from my point of view,
we have lots and lots of fiber,

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:90%
most of it from vegetables.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you feeding
things to your gut

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can't absorb yourself
so the bacteria get to eat it,

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and then each eat
other's byproducts?

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Fat's really been demonized.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
For most of my
lifetime, I thought

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:90%
fat was really bad for you.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that some fat is

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:84%
bad for you, which is
mostly processed fats, which

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
are the kind that you
find in processed foods.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:84%
But the fats that I were
told were really bad,

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
like saturated
fats, it turns out

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
are incredibly
beneficial for the brain.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Saturated fats are the
fats we want to be eating,

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're the fats that
we can find in coconut oil.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:84%
We found them in
animal fat, which

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
if the animal has
been raised humanely,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
is a really wonderful
source of good fat.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
The body can process those
fats because they're pure.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:90%
They're just what they are.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had
anything done to them.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:90%
There's been no tampering.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I am somebody who believes
in butter, hands down.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I think the French
have got it right.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.245 align:middle line:84%
You don't find obese
people in France.

00:19:18.245 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
They eat tons and
tons of butter.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.153 align:middle line:90%
Butter does not make you fat.

00:19:21.153 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> We have it all backwards.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:90%
We have it all backwards.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The whole system, Drew, is based
on this model of let's lower

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
cholesterol levels, and let's
do whatever it takes to do that.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.648 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any evidence
that lower cholesterol

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
levels produce longevity or
a higher quality of health.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.452 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we have some evidence
to the exact opposite of that.

00:19:39.452 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
recent studies that

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.827 align:middle line:84%
was published in the
"British Medical Journal"

00:19:42.827 --> 00:19:44.640 align:middle line:84%
showed that people
living in England

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.947 align:middle line:84%
over the age of 60 that
had the highest LDL

00:19:46.947 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
levels, the type of
cholesterol that's often

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
referred to as bad cholesterol--
they lived the longest

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and had the highest
quality of health.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> For one, your cells need fat.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:84%
All of our cells have a
fat wrapper cell membrane.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And your brain is 70% fat.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Your cell membrane is 70%
saturated fat and cholesterol.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> As a neurologist, I
actually recommend feeding lots

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
of unprocessed fats, including
saturated fats in moderation.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But fat is definitely
your friend

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to the brain.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been living with HIV--

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:90%
let's see.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I tested positive in 1991,
so that's 26 years now

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that I've been aware
of being HIV positive.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:10%
The most specific
thing I can observe

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:10%
is that most of the
people who I meet

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:10%
who take the kinds of drugs
that I take experience digestive

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:10%
problems.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Often diarrhea,
nausea, other kinds

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
of digestive side
effects, and I've just

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:90%
never experienced that.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I feel like the
luckiest man in the world,

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
just because I have had hundreds
of people come up and tell me

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that I changed their life,
that reading my book,

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
realizing how easy
fermentation was,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.840 align:middle line:84%
incorporating fermented
foods into their diets

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
has just improved
their quality of life.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So I just feel
like I'm repeatedly

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:90%
hearing stories like that.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
What we understand now that
has not necessarily always been

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
apparent is that all of
the things that make up

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
our food-- all of the plants
and all of the animal products

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that people eat are populated
by elaborate communities

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:90%
of microorganisms.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And in order to harness this
inevitable life force that's

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
part of all of our food, so
that rather than it decomposing

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:84%
our food into a disgusting
mess that nobody would ever

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:84%
want to eat, we use
it to improve our food

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:90%
in various ways.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
To make our food more delicious,
to make our food more easily

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.108 align:middle line:90%
digestible.

00:22:08.108 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I love fermented food.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So I could have a
whole dinner plate

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:84%
full of sauerkraut, or kimchi,
or the fermented beets,

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
fermented carrots.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And so by eating fermented
foods as part of my meals,

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I get a vastly larger dose and
a more diverse amount of species

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:90%
introduced into my gut.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When you make
sauerkraut or kimchi,

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:90%
you're never adding bacteria.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.260 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is just
creating the conditions

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
where the bacteria that's on
all vegetables, on all plants

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:90%
can proliferate.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:84%
The most profound benefit of
fermented foods, the greatest

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.940 align:middle line:84%
promise of fermented foods lies
in eating bacteria themselves--

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
the probiotic benefit
of eating foods

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that are rich with diverse
communities of bacteria

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and can help to enrich
that genetic environment

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
in our intestines
for the bacteria that

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
are in residence
there, and generally

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
promote greater
biodiversity, which can have

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of benefits for us.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.986 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.986 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, with the
broth, it's like a reset.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going
on crazy diets,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.848 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the things
to do is to reset the gut.

00:23:26.848 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you can start to eat
things that you might otherwise

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.307 align:middle line:90%
have been allergic to.

00:23:30.307 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
There's so many food allergies
in our time now, and part of it

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
is because the food
isn't pure anymore.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming
from a pure source.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think part of it
is also because there's

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:90%
environmental toxins.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
things that play in.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
If there was one thing
that I would say,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
like the simplest
way to heal yourself,

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
would be to just start the
day with a cup of bone broth.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you really wanted to
do like a drastic cleanse,

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
you could actually
do bone breath

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.015 align:middle line:84%
for five days or
up to two weeks.

00:24:00.015 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It would nourish you.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:90%
It would keep you alive.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
With water and teas, you
would be completely, utterly

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:90%
nourished.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But also, what it
does is it gently

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
heals the gut lining
so that you can then

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:84%
take in other foods that are
a little bit more irritable.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
You basically are receiving
some sort of very--

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:90%
not pre-digested, but it is.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:90%
It's really pure.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It's going straight
in, and you're not

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:90%
having to do any chewing.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.125 align:middle line:84%
You're not having to do a
whole-- your digestion is

00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:90%
saying, oh, yummy, yummy, yummy.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.512 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this is the--

00:24:33.512 --> 00:24:52.974 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.974 --> 00:24:53.774 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on.

00:24:53.774 --> 00:24:54.149 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.949 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.497 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to miss the light.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.591 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:01.591 --> 00:25:02.391 align:middle line:90%
Geez.

00:25:02.391 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I think nature is one of
the most important things

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
in my life and in
my family's life.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, I think
it's the greatest classroom.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we learn
more about the world

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and the ways in which we can
live within it from looking

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
at the way animals, and
plants, and everything

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
has their own way in this
amazing ecosystem, wherever

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:90%
that may be.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.892 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just a way
for us to slow down.

00:25:33.892 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a way for us to appreciate
the really important things

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.123 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.123 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
most important things

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:84%
to acquire greater
gut diversity is

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to have an enormous
amount of exposure

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:90%
to various aspects of nature.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of our kids today don't
have their hands in the dirt

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:90%
or in soil.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.508 align:middle line:84%
Far fewer people grow
up on small farms,

00:25:54.508 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
where there was a wide variety
of microbes in the environment

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.800 align:middle line:84%
We tend to live
in a very sterile

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
or sterilized environment.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Our food supply is highly
pasteurized, sterilized.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We try to take the
microbes out of everything,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.663 align:middle line:84%
whether it's with handwashes
or it's with pasteurization.

00:26:10.663 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think one
of the best things

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
we can do is have exposure
to a variety of animals,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:84%
whether that be a
household pet like a dog,

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
to have contact with plants
in nature as much as possible,

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and to acquire soil-based
organisms, which we know

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
can have a really profound
influence on gut health.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The soil, in a way,
is the final frontier.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:84%
We know so much
more about the stars

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:84%
up there than we know about
the soil that is under our feet

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people have heard
of the hygiene hypothesis.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And the hygiene
hypothesis was basically

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that children who
grow up on farms

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:84%
are much less likely
to have allergies

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and asthma than children who
grow up in urban environments.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what the
researchers said was,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
well, this is because
it's dirtier on farms.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And really, there are
just more bacteria there.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And so some researchers
came along and said,

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's really
measure how many

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:84%
organisms are in
an urban apartment

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and how many are on a farm.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And they found actually
that the number of bacteria

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:84%
were equal, pretty
close to equal.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But what was different was
the diversity of organisms

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
on the farm were far
greater, so there

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:84%
were many more types
of organisms on a farm

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
than there were in
the urban apartment.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what our
bodies really crave.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I really do believe that
this paranoia to be super clean,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.210 align:middle line:84%
it's something that
we need to revisit.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, I was at the
airport three or four days ago

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.860 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was extremely refreshing
to see this young family

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
with this toddler that was
just playing on the ground.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And mom and dad had
no problem whatsoever

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that not only was doing this,
but when he was sitting,

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:90%
he put his hands in the mouth.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, look at this.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
What you see here is the
product of two million years

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And 99.99% of the time, we
act like that little baby

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
crawling on the
floor and not caring

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:84%
about what to do with
my hands after that--

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:90%
that's the way that we evolved.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the only passed
40, 50 years that hey,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
we've been changing
dramatically.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of these immune
cells that are floating around

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:84%
as being very social, and they
want to meet and greet lots

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of different kinds of
organisms all the time,

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and see lots of diversity
of food and microbes.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, it's
very balanced and happy.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:84%
When there are only
a few kinds, that's

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
when it starts to see
everything as a threat.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.067 align:middle line:84%
And then you see things
like allergies, asthma,

00:28:58.067 --> 00:28:59.025 align:middle line:90%
and autoimmune disease.

00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> For my personal life, I have
to be outdoors at some point

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:84%
in the day, even if it's
a torrential downpour.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:84%
We've had a really,
really wet summer.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter and
I went recently--

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I go walking with her a lot
because she has a dog that

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:90%
needs a lot of exercise.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
The woods, and lakes, and
rivers are really my church.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I used to try to always
go for a hike on a Sunday

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.520 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not a
churchgoer, but it was--

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:84%
it is really important for
me to sit by a river just

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to let myself come to
a place of stillness,

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a very
active, outgoing person.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So to just sit by the
river and be still--

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I would say that's
my number one.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I
absolutely love is once people

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:84%
go outside and just stop and
experience how they feel,

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.400 align:middle line:90%
they get it.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a
study to prove it.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:84%
You get it, just
by being outside.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The ways that we can align
ourselves more with a very

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:84%
traditional human life or
experience are maybe even more

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.513 align:middle line:90%
profound than what we eat.

00:30:04.513 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Getting out in the sunlight?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
incredibly therapeutic,

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and I think there's a
requirement for that

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.178 align:middle line:90%
for optimal health.

00:30:10.178 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to have
a certain amount of time

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:90%
out in the sun.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
It goes way beyond
vitamin D production.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.835 align:middle line:90%
It's all about light therapy.

00:30:16.835 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And we don't get
enough infrared light.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't get enough UVB.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And so these are things that a
lot of people have just lost.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't spend any time in
contact with our surface.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people run
from the sun now,

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
just like they do
from saturated fat.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So you end up with a
long list of problems

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:84%
as you create greater
and greater discord

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:84%
between that traditional
way of human life

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and the way we live now.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I sometimes have to
multitask my nature into my day

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a busy mom and
doctor, so I trail run.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's
for a quick run,

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm running through the forest
so I get my exposure to nature.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I get my microbes.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:90%
I get the peaceful feeling.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm exercising
at the same time.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I like to multitask
by just doing whatever I can

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:84%
outdoors, which might
mean running outside,

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and it might mean
having my lunch outside.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Also, sometimes I'll
just take a moment

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to stand outside
when it's sunset,

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:84%
or it's just a beautiful
moment in the day

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and just take a
moment of gratitude.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, can be
very powerful, as well.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> What I would
recommend to anybody,

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
but particularly anybody
raising children,

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:84%
is create opportunities to get
your kids outside in nature,

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
touching plants, getting
their hands in the dirt,

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:90%
maybe playing with some animals.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And we need more
bacterial biodiversity.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.675 align:middle line:84%
It's how our immune
systems learn to function.

00:31:56.675 --> 00:32:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I think fear is one of the
biggest barriers to a better

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:10%
quality of life and
to better health.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
afraid of the sun.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
afraid of saturated fat.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I think people are afraid of
getting their hands dirty--

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.450 align:middle line:84%
putting their hands
in really rich soil

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.935 align:middle line:90%
that may have cow manure in it.

00:32:25.935 --> 00:32:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It may have a wide
variety of microbes in it.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.092 align:middle line:84%
But once you start
living a life of fear,

00:32:30.092 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:84%
you start to reduce your
exposure to all those things

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:90%
that truly nourish us.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the same way when people
start to isolate themselves.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.280 align:middle line:90%
They have a fear of strangers.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.670 align:middle line:84%
They have a fear of
communicating with people

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:90%
that they don't know very well.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.880 align:middle line:84%
That leads to a whole long
list of mental disorders.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I think fear is the greatest
barrier to people really having

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.530 align:middle line:84%
the full experience that I
think they should enjoy in life.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether it's just about
prevention or it's about

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:06.310 align:middle line:84%
reversing a condition
that someone already has,

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:11.470 align:middle line:84%
we have such plastic brains and
bodies that all we have to do

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.540 align:middle line:84%
is give them the
tools that they need.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.935 align:middle line:84%
And very often, I see really
transformational healing.

00:33:17.935 --> 00:33:22.528 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.528 --> 00:33:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And so these things, like
Alzheimer's, and heart disease,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and cancer, are not inevitable
consequences of getting older.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at other
societies, Blue Zones,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
places like Okinawa,
Japan, and Sardinia,

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.843 align:middle line:84%
off the coast of Italy, maybe
Icaria-- it's a Greek island--

00:33:38.843 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
these are parts
of the world where

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:84%
people don't experience chronic,
complex disease in the way

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think the joy in
life, and the joy in eating,

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and the joy in cooking--

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:84%
if that's not there, then
we're not going to heal.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So in order to heal and
in order to move forward

00:33:55.590 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
as humans in evolution,
we have to have joy,

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and we have to also observe
this incredibly beautiful planet

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.310 align:middle line:84%
that we still have and be
grateful for every single

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.020 align:middle line:90%
living and care for it.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Care for our food.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Care for where it comes from.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Care for the animals.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.989 align:middle line:90%
Care for our water sources.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:84%
If we're not doing
that, then no matter

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:24.139 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge and information
is going to help us.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The [INAUDIBLE] food pyramid
for an ideal lifestyle--

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom, the stuff that
you have to consume the most,

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:90%
there is no food.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.260 align:middle line:90%
It's lifestyle.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Play outside, have fun, don't
take yourself seriously,

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.440 align:middle line:90%
grow old together.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
When you sit for a meal,
sit together as a family.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
These were given
activities until two,

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:90%
three generation ago.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Not anymore.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't do this anymore.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.699 align:middle line:84%
So why we are surprised that
we're paying such a price?

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:56.409 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to become
our own doctors.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when it comes
to specialization,

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:84%
or somebody needs an organ
transplant or something,

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:84%
absolutely the
doctors, the surgeons,

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:84%
the hospitals are
absolutely incredible when

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.060 align:middle line:90%
it comes to those things.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:10%
But we need to learn how to
recuperate after surgery.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.140 align:middle line:10%
They don't pretend to
know how to do that.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.270 align:middle line:10%
They want you out of there
as quickly as possible.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Get home.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Get back into your environment.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Go for a walk.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So we need to learn that all
these holistic measures-- what

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:84%
we eat, how we exercise,
how we enjoy community,

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:84%
how we love our families--
all these things

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
are so integral to staying
well, to being healthy,

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.102 align:middle line:84%
and to furthering the
evolution of the planet.

00:35:45.102 --> 00:35:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd love to tell you a story
about a woman that I worked

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:84%
She came in to me after a
lecture on heart disease,

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and she walked in and
said, I am a heart attack

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.820 align:middle line:90%
waiting to happen.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And her story went like this.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.820 align:middle line:84%
She had just had
her third medicine

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:84%
added for blood pressure that
was spiraling out of control.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.830 align:middle line:84%
She was on an
acid-blocking medication

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:90%
for her terrible reflux.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:90%
She'd gained 30 pounds.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.950 align:middle line:84%
She was stress-eating because
part of her day-to-day

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:12.700 align:middle line:84%
was taking care of her husband
who had chronic lung disease,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was just
spiraling out of control.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.070 align:middle line:84%
We didn't put her on
any specific program,

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:84%
but we talked about
the importance

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:84%
of her taking care of herself,
and eating a whole foods diet,

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:90%
and getting some movement.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear back from
her for nine months.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.650 align:middle line:84%
When she came back in,
I didn't recognize her.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:90%
She had lost 30 pounds.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.483 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow.

00:36:32.483 --> 00:36:33.775 align:middle line:90%
What did you do with your diet?

00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, I just quit the
stress eating and the processed

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
foods, and I'm mostly eating
protein and vegetables.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.538 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:36:39.538 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
for your exercise?

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not going
to a gym or anything.

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.072 align:middle line:84%
I just practice
running up the stairs

00:36:44.072 --> 00:36:45.963 align:middle line:84%
to see how fast I
can go every day.

00:36:45.963 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the most
important things she did

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.350 align:middle line:84%
is she hired a young girl
to come in twice a week

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and take care of her
husband, so she was now

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:84%
free to go back and have
lunch with her friends,

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and get out and do
things, and re-engage.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And here was what was
beautiful about that.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
She was off of all of her
blood pressure medicines,

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:84%
except one that was
on a minimal dose.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:84%
She had stopped her
acid-blocking medicines.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.110 align:middle line:84%
She had stopped her
antidepressants.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.800 align:middle line:84%
She had stopped
her sleeping pills.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:84%
She had stopped her
anti-inflammatories

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:90%
for her joints.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And she had a joy
that was basically,

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I am so excited for the
next chapter of what

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do tomorrow.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I had these two twin boys who
came to see me who were having

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:90%
starring spells.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:84%
They were having
absence seizures.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
each of them only eight

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.610 align:middle line:90%
about four foods.

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
They were really limited,
and they were only

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.410 align:middle line:90%
eating very processed foods.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we got these
kids onto a whole foods diet--

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.850 align:middle line:84%
meaning very
unprocessed, and they

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:84%
were eating much more diverse
foods, lots more fruits

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:10%
And it took a little
time to get there,

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:10%
but by getting them
on a whole foods diet,

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.110 align:middle line:10%
eating more fermented foods,
and actually de-scheduling

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:04.000 align:middle line:10%
their day a little bit
so they had more time

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.670 align:middle line:10%
to just play outdoors
in the afternoon,

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:11.630 align:middle line:10%
they stopped having
seizures without being

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:10%
on any medications.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I monitored them for
two years after that,

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and basically, we saw a total
reversal in their condition,

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:84%
simply by making some
very significant changes

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.060 align:middle line:90%
in the way they were living.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:10%
>> So there's a fellow, a vet,
who had an injury to his leg

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.090 align:middle line:10%
and a traumatic
amputation to his leg.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And he had a profound
neuropathic pain--

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.650 align:middle line:90%
phantom limb pain.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.180 align:middle line:90%
He had become an alcoholic.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
He'd gotten over his
alcoholism, had a wife.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:84%
But his pain was getting
more and more severe.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.400 align:middle line:84%
He had been to the pain
clinic multiple times,

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.230 align:middle line:90%
had multiple procedures.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:84%
They just could not get
control of the pain.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:90%
He'd been in and out of the ER.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And the pain clinic
finally said,

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.330 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing more
I can do for you,

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to
go to see Dr. Walls,

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:84%
the therapeutic
lifestyle clinic.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And he went home and said, you
know, I got nothing to lose.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:10%
So he and his wife
adopted our protocol 100%,

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.760 align:middle line:10%
and he came back
in six weeks, said,

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.500 align:middle line:10%
things are a little bit better.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Then he came back again, so
in three months, his pain--

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:84%
still there, but
markedly reduced.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:84%
His mental clarity
markedly improved.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling the newbies to
the group, you got to do this.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.532 align:middle line:90%
I got a Vitamix.

00:39:40.532 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:90%
We're making smoothies.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.198 align:middle line:84%
I have green smoothies
every day so I can

00:39:43.198 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:90%
get all those vegetables in.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And so he became a
poster child for the fact

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:10%
that no matter how desperate
things are, that give it a

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.640 align:middle line:10%
try 100% for a hundred days.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.310 align:middle line:90%
He transformed his life.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And anyone who thinks that
their doctor is the answer

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.900 align:middle line:84%
to their health, or that the
hospitals in their communities

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:84%
are the answers to their health,
is missing a huge opportunity

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to take greater
control of their lives.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We know that 75%, 80%
of all chronic disease

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.930 align:middle line:90%
can be traced to lifestyle.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And healthy living doesn't
happen in doctor's offices.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Healthy living doesn't
happen in hospitals.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Healthy living and the
road to healthy living

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.840 align:middle line:84%
is paved by the choices we
make each and every moment.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.903 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.903 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So I believe that the kitchen
needs to be a place where

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.720 align:middle line:84%
there's laughter,
and joy, and fun.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And I thank the people
with special needs

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.870 align:middle line:84%
benefit from the
food they're eating,

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:50.580 align:middle line:84%
but they benefit from
being part of that.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But they don't just
get sat down at a table

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and the food comes in on a tray.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But they've been part of
harvesting, and bringing it

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:03.930 align:middle line:84%
in, and cleaning it, and then
cooking it, and then eating it.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And those who can
express that verbally

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.880 align:middle line:84%
have expressed to
me many, many times

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.260 align:middle line:90%
how much that means to them.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I just never
get tired of that,

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and I just feel
like if that's all

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I did from now until I
died, that would be great,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.450 align:middle line:84%
just teaching people
to nourish themselves.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I just hope that
people watching will

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
get inspired to get
back in the kitchen,

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.205 align:middle line:84%
and not see it as going
backwards, especially

00:41:29.205 --> 00:41:30.005 align:middle line:90%
for women.

00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:90%
We can do it all.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We can work and we
can be in the kitchen,

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have to be
the women in the kitchen.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It can be the men
in the kitchen,

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:84%
the kids in the kitchen,
and we can do it together.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We can have parties where
we all cook together.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:50.868 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's the only
way to really preserve a healing

00:41:50.868 --> 00:41:51.668 align:middle line:90%
step forward.

00:41:51.668 --> 00:42:05.612 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.612 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:10%
(SINGING) Talk about
another lovely day.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.842 align:middle line:10%
The concrete tunnel
and the pavement gray.

00:42:12.842 --> 00:42:16.534 align:middle line:84%
Walls are closing
in on me again,

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.426 align:middle line:90%
buried in the bosom of society.

00:42:19.426 --> 00:42:23.282 align:middle line:90%
What's the cost of it all?

00:42:23.282 --> 00:42:26.656 align:middle line:84%
What do you pay for
making poor decisions?

00:42:26.656 --> 00:42:29.510 align:middle line:90%


00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.123 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Teddy.

00:42:32.123 --> 00:42:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Teddy right there?

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> That's Teddy, the
donkey, just pinching in.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I think he's saying,
joy is important.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Let's
stop for a minute.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:45.337 align:middle line:90%
There's a loud one.

00:42:45.337 --> 00:42:47.420 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to get a shot
of Teddy on the way out.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.020 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Finally I
feel a sudden breeze.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.320 align:middle line:90%
I hear the horizon calling me.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm dying to get
out of this place

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:10%
and find me the simple
things that we all know.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm
headed for the hills.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.420 align:middle line:90%
And I'm never coming back.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.620 align:middle line:90%
What's the cost of it all?

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:84%
What do you pay for
making poor decisions?

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] starts to
fall, gosh, you never

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.120 align:middle line:90%
make a better difference.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it in my gut.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Feel it in my gut.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.568 align:middle line:90%
