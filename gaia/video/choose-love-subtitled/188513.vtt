in the foot and other details.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I really got concerned,
really concerned.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for my
little brown-headed boy

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and not finding him.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So I remember going up to
anyone that looked official.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
There were firemen
and policemen,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and there were even army men.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:84%
There were helicopters
flying overhead.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:90%
It was chaos.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was going up to anybody
that looked official saying,

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:84%
have you seen my
son, Jesse Lewis?

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:90%
I can't find him.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And finally somebody
said, I think

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:90%
that he went to the house.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a little yellow house
on the left of the firehouse.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:90%
I think he went to that house.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I ran over to that house
and knocked on the door,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.525 align:middle line:90%
and an older man answered.

00:23:02.525 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, was
Jesse Lewis here?

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I think he was.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think he ran
over to the daycare.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Then I ran over to the daycare.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And Neil, his
father, is looking.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're texting
back and forth,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:84%
have you checked here,
have you checked there?

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find him.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Neil left to go
check the hospitals because all

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:90%
of the lines were busy.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I finally went
into that back room.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I put his name down on a
long list at the very bottom.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- I mean,
I didn't think ever

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
in a million years that
all those people were dead.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Jesse had such energy
and such vibrance.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
He was bouncing off the
walls, and he was so loud.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And his stuff was
all over the place.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'll never be
able to go back to my home

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and see all of his things.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And the silence
will be deafening.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But there came a
time when I had to.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember walking in with
lots of family and friends

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Walking back out
through the kitchen

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and out through the front door,
when I noticed on our kitchen

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:84%
chalkboard that Jesse had
written a message sometime

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:90%
shortly before he died.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
He wrote three words,
nurturing healing love.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I
would be spending

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.350 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life spreading
this message of nurturing

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:90%
