Every 100 years or so,
an idea comes along

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that could shake the world,
an idea so revolutionary,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that at first, no one

When Galileo showed evidence
that the Earth moved

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
around the sun, the
authorities arrested him.

But eventually, if the
evidence is convincing,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%

to Egypt to examine

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
the controversial theories
of John Anthony West.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
West and his team of scientists
challenge our long-held views

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
about the origins
of the great Sphinx.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
They suggest that
the Sphinx was carved

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
before Egypt became a desert,
9,000 to 10,000 years ago.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It's remarkable that
for thousands of years,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
the evidence has
been in plain sight,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:84%
yet till now no one has
recognized its significance.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:10%
If West's theories
prove to be correct,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.833 align:middle line:10%
the implications are staggering.

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught that the
people who inhabited Egypt

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
during that early
period were primitives

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
who survived by hunting
and scavenging for food.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
John West believes that
this view is incomplete.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
He feels that an entire
chapter of man's early history

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:90%
is missing.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
West's team has
uncovered new evidence

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
which suggests that
we're descendants

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of an unknown earlier
civilization, an advanced

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
culture capable of incredible
technological feats.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, we'll
examine this evidence

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
to see if man's early history
needs to be rewritten.

and stood in awe of
these great monuments.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Of all ancient
civilizations, none

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
has left behind such a wealth
of artistic and architectural

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:90%
mastery.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.480 align:middle line:84%
These magnificent temples
were the inspiration

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:84%
for the artists of
Ancient Greece and Rome,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
who in turn passed
their knowledge onto us.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.132 align:middle line:84%

Egyptians in the first place?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:90%

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
240-feet long, the length of

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
the height of a six story
building, the Sphinx

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
has the body of a lion
and the head of a man.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It was carved in one piece of
wood solid limestone bedrock.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It rests in its own
enclosure, facing

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
East to catch the first
rays of the rising sun.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists who specialize
in ancient Egyptian dynasties

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
now believe that the
Sphinx was carved

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
by the Pharaoh Chephren in
his own image 4,500 years ago.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Chephren is the
Pharaoh who's credited

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
with building the
second of the three

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
major pyramids in
the Giza Plateau

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.694 align:middle line:84%
during what's known as
the Old Kingdom Period.

00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:84%
For over half its
known life, the Sphinx

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:84%
has been buried up
to its neck in sand.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Despite this protection
from the elements,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
the body of the Sphinx
is deeply eroded.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Although it's been dug out
and repaired many times,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
nothing's ever been found to
tell us who built the Sphinx,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
or when.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
This is John
Anthony West, author

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and independent Egyptologist.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
While researching the work of
French mathematician, Schwaller

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.470 align:middle line:84%
de Lubicz, he made
a chance discovery

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%
that would change his life.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Schwaller made the
simple observation

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx had been
eroded by water, not

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
by wind and sand, as
traditionally believed.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
These are two very
different types of erosion.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Water in the Sahara Desert.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
There's been no significant
rainfall in the Sahara

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:90%
for 9,000 to 10,000 years.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
West was the first person to
grasp the implications of this.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:84%
If the Sphinx was
eroded by water,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
it had to be at least
9,000 years old.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The deep erosion is easy to
see, but it takes an expert

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:90%
to identify its cause.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.009 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:10%
Through some friends,
I had an introduction

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:10%
to a very well-known
Oxford geologist.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:10%
And I went into him with
a very simple question,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:10%
on the basis of a
clear photograph alone,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:10%
could he as a geologist
tell the difference

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:10%
between weathering by water and
weathering by wind and sand?

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
The answer was
cautiously expressed,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:90%
as a general rule, yes.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I asked him if he didn't mind if
I play a bit of a trick on him.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I took
a photograph of the Sphinx,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and I masked off the head and
the paws, and I asked him,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
what did he think
that was responsible

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:90%
for that weathering?

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at it a
moment and said, well,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:90%
unquestionably water.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I stripped
the masking tape off,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at it a
minute, and he said, oh.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>The Oxford geologist
realized that if the Sphinx was

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
more than 9,000 years old, the
entire history of ancient man

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:90%
would have to be rewritten.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
He wanted no part of such
a controversial subject.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
In his book, Serpent
in the Sky, West first

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
published his theory
of an older Sphinx.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Scholars laughed
and ignored him.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
West needed an ally,
a recognized expert

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.322 align:middle line:84%
willing to examine the evidence
with the courage to stand

00:07:56.322 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:90%
behind his conclusions.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Robert Schoch is an
Associate Professor of Science

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:90%
at Boston University.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.110 align:middle line:84%
He holds a Ph.D. In
Geology and Geophysics

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:90%
from Yale University.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Schoch is an expert in the
erosional analysis of rocks.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:10%
>>What I found was that West
had one very extreme idea

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:10%
that the Sphinx was
thousands of years

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:10%
older than the
Egyptologists thought,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:10%
so I thought it was a long shot.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe West
was onto something

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought was very
improbable, but it

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:90%
was worth looking at further.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm a curious type of person.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.109 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.109 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
>>West and Schoch
traveled to Egypt

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
to examine the
evidence first hand.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
While Egyptologists
look at monuments,

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:84%
geologists look at the
stones they're made from.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And those stones
told Schoch that West

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:90%
was on the right track.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Schoch was encouraged
by what he saw,

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
but the team was totally
unprepared for what

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:90%
happened next.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, word of their
theory leaked out,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and they found themselves
attacked in the press.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
This is an American
hallucination.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
They're exploiting the monuments
of Egypt for personal gains,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
said Dr. Zahi Hawass,
Director of the Giza Plateau.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The team is ignorant
and insensitive,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
this from Dr. Mark
Lehner, Egyptologist.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:10%
There is many theories like this
has been said about the Sphinx,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:10%
but all of it, gone with the
wind, because we Egyptologists

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:10%
have solid evidence to state
that the Sphinx is dated

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:10%
to the time of Chephren, the
builder of the second pyramid

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:10%
at Giza Plateau.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>West and Schoch were
undaunted by the ridicule.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.352 align:middle line:84%
They knew their theory was
based on solid evidence.

00:09:44.352 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Virtually all of the temples
and tombs in the Giza Plateau

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
have been weathered
by wind and sand.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So why would the Sphinx
be the only monument

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:90%
weathered by water?

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
To a geologist, erosion tells
the story of a rock's history.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:10%
The limestone bedrock in Giza
is like a layer cake composed

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:10%
of both hard and soft layers.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:10%
The wind-driven sand scours
out the softer layers,

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:10%
leaving the harder
layers intact.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
An example of this is
found here in the Tomb

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
of [INAUDIBLE],
which is carved out

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.915 align:middle line:84%
of the exact same
rock as the Sphinx.

00:10:26.915 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Once a smooth wall,
it's been exposed

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to desert conditions
for over 4,000 years.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
rain weathering

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:90%
has an entirely different look.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Rocks which have been
weathered by rain

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.866 align:middle line:84%
have a round,
undulating profile.

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
This is very different
in appearance

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
from the hard, sharp profile
caused by wind weather.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:10%
This is a classic
textbook example

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:10%
of what happens to
a limestone wall

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:10%
when you have rains beating down
on it for thousands of years.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>It's only found in one
area on the Giza Plateau,

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
here on the Sphinx, and on the
walls of the Sphinx enclosure.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
These man-made vertical walls
were carved from the same layer

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.520 align:middle line:90%
bedrock a mere 300 yards apart.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
According to Egyptologists, they
were carved at the same time.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But if that's so, shouldn't
they exhibit the same pattern

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:90%
of erosion?

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.256 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lehner has an entirely
different explanation.

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, Dr. Schoch is
saying have this same layer.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.285 align:middle line:10%
And here on the
Sphinx, it's weathered,

00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:37.787 align:middle line:10%
and here on this
old kingdom tomb.

00:11:37.787 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:10%
it's not, carved out
of the same layer.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.349 align:middle line:84%
And we are saying, and
I bow to Dr. [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:45.890 align:middle line:84%
on this as the geologist, no,
those are two different layers.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.348 align:middle line:84%
They'll weather at
different rates.

00:11:47.348 --> 00:11:50.474 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to
that, basically, aside

00:11:50.474 --> 00:11:53.396 align:middle line:84%
from the massive
problem that Dr. Schoch

00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:54.857 align:middle line:90%
has with no cultural context.

00:11:54.857 --> 00:11:59.727 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.727 --> 00:12:02.416 align:middle line:84%
When you think of
water in Egypt,

00:12:02.416 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
you automatically
think of the Nile.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Could the legendary Nile
floods have eroded the Sphinx?

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's a
nice hypothesis,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
but it just doesn't
hold up to scrutiny.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:10%
What you have here are rocks,
where the lowest most rocks,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:10%
which are a bit softer than
the rocks at the very top, just

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:10%
out further.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
If it were Nile
floods coming in,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
you would expect these soft
rocks to be eroded it way back.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
As the waters rose
up, you would expect

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
this to be eroded way
back, and it should

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:90%
undercut the uppermost rocks.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact, is
not what we see.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:84%
If we look up there, we
see a new under cutting,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:84%
where you have a
very soft layer.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But the next layer above, which
is harder than this layer,

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:90%
is receded way back.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So no, it's not Nile floods
that are causing this erosion.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.079 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly rain,
precipitation causing

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:55.120 align:middle line:90%
these erosional features.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>One thing I think
one has to realize

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:84%
is that the Sphinx itself
is in very bad shape

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th century.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:90%
It's deteriorating very quickly.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You can literally stand
in front of the Sphinx

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and watch stones fall off of it.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Smog, pollution, acid rain are
all affecting it drastically

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
and weathering it very quickly.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that some
critics have suggested

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
is that, in fact, I'm not taking
these factors into account,

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
that when I'm looking
at weathering,

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I might just simply be looking
at modern weathering features.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I just want to assure everyone
that I have taken this

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:90%
into account.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's a very serious
problem, the modern weathering.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But the weathering
that I'm looking at

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
is the ancient weathering,
the weathering that we

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:90%
see under ancient repairs.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
different ball game.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.316 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole different
set of evidence

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:90%
than the modern weathering.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Schoch was certain that the
walls of the Sphinx enclosure

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
were eroded by
water cascading down

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:84%
off the Giza Plateau, water
whose only possible source

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
was rain.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.744 align:middle line:84%
This was the key element
in Schoch's argument.

00:14:06.744 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER]

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.332 align:middle line:90%
But when did it rain?

00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. John Kutzbach is a
Professor of Paleoclimatology

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Wisconsin.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Paleoclimatology is the study
of ancient weather patterns.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:10%
>>The first way that
we try to and determine

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:10%
the climate of the past is
by looking at observations.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
There are plenty of observations
from North Africa that

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
show that that region was
covered with lakes in the past.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's a desert,
but 10,000 years ago, there

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.367 align:middle line:90%
were lakes in the Sahara.

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Then there's an
entirely different way

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that we figure out the
climate of the past,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's with our
computer models.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:84%
We then can calculate
what the change in climate

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:90%
would be like for that time.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is
that the geologic evidence

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and the computer
simulations both

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
agree that around
10,000 years ago,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
the Sahara was wetter
than it is now.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Schoch and West felt that
the evidence of water erosion

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
was so strong, there must be
other evidence in the area

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:90%
to support an over Sphinx.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>Take a look at this.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.069 align:middle line:10%
You can see the
rolling, weathering,

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:10%
the precipitation-induced
weathering.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:10%
And here, you see very
nicely all these joints,

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:10%
which are various fault
joints and whatnot.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:10%
You don't see this same
type of joints opening up

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.493 align:middle line:10%
in the wind-induced weathering.

00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm standing in a vertical
fissure on the southern wall

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx enclosure.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:84%
This vertical fissure was
clearly formed by water

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:90%
running down the wall.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It would pick out the
weak spots in the rock,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
open them up into
these fissures.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
This is clear evidence
to me as a geologist

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that this erosional
feature we see

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:84%
was caused by rain
beating down on the rocks.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Here is the actual photograph
of the back of the Sphinx

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
enclosure you see the rolling,
undulating weathered profile.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Here's a diagram of that
same profile shown here.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And what you're looking
at diagrammatically here

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
are the different beds,
the different layers,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:84%
which you can see
in the photograph

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and see even better when
you're in the field,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
actually walking
around looking at it.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
These different layers, some of
them are harder, some of them

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle line:90%
are softer.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Professor [INAUDIBLE]
has calculated, in fact,

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:84%
durability factors for
the different layers.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And the way this works is
the higher the durability,

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the higher the number like 86
versus 11, the more durable

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:90%
that particular rock is.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, we see some
of the rocks, which

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
have very durability
factors say, of 11,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
they are in fact receded
back and under cut the rocks

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:90%
above them.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So 11 recedes back
further than 56.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:84%
But notice that doesn't
work in every case.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more durable
rocks, like 76, 75, 86

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
actually received back further
than some of the less durable

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:90%
rocks, like 42 or 56.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
If this started out as
a vertical or nearly

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
vertical profile, why would
these more durable rocks

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.540 align:middle line:90%
recede back further?

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest
this is consistent

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.890 align:middle line:84%
with precipitation-induced
weathering, where

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:84%
you have water, rainwater
beating down from above.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the rocks
that are higher up,

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
even if they're
more durable, they

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:84%
take the brunt of more
rain hitting them,

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and they recede back
further than some

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.927 align:middle line:84%
of the less durable rocks
lower in the section, which

00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:54.727 align:middle line:90%
are more protected.

00:17:54.727 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
If the Sphinx was
damaged by rain,

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence suggests it
was much wetter in the Sahara

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:84%
region 9,000 to
10,000 years ago,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:84%
then the Sphinx must be
more than 9,000 years old.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
That's twice as old
as history tells us.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Why had no one
noticed this before?

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
When the first dinosaur
bone was discovered in 1838,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:90%
no one even knew what it was.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:84%
There was no frame
of reference for it.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
No one had even
heard of dinosaurs.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And as more bones were
found all over the world,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
scientists put the
pieces together.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.602 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.602 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Schoch and West were now
ready to test their theory.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
They submitted their findings
to the annual conference

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Geological
Society of America.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a single moment that
really got the project rolling,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and that was actually
the moment when

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:84%
we were invited
to the Geological

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Society of the America's
convention, Schoch and myself.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:90%
We'd put in an abstract.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Schoch was by this time
absolutely convinced

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:90%
that the theory was valid.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a basic forum to
express new ideas in geology.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And quite honestly are
quick to shoot people down

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:84%
if they find fault in the
theories and ideas presented.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Much to my pleasure, no
one pointed out any errors.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they found the
evidence quite interesting,

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:90%
even compelling.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Doctor Schoch
was being modest.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
As a result of his presentation,
275 of the attending geologists

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
offered to help
with his project.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
The argument escalated
into a battle

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:84%
between two unrelated
branches of science, geology

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:90%
and Egyptology.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>>We're relatively
certain of the accuracy

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:10%
of our reconstruction of
Egyptian civilization.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if we were to
take the alternative view,

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.190 align:middle line:90%
think of what we're stuck with.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:84%
We have an antediluvian
civilization

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
with all the trappings of
later Pharaonic civilization,

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:84%
like the Sphinx, with the
characteristic Egyptian head

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
cloth, with the
characteristic use of the lion

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.921 align:middle line:84%
in the guise of the King,
and then you have nothing.

00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing for how long?

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:90%
1,000 years?

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years?

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And then it starts up again.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Where's the link?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
What ties this antediluvian
culture to what came later?

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that two
exactly parallel cultures

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
evolved at the same place
3,000, 4,000, 5,000 years apart?

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
Star Trek episode.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
It simply doesn't work that way.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Culture evolves in
a linear fashion.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:10%
To accept the theories
that you're reporting

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:10%
means that you've got
culture A, culture B,

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:10%
and in between, nothing.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And it simply doesn't
work that way.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>What's actually at stake
are the implications,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
the impact it has upon
accepted views of the evolution

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
We think, and it's
a kind of a spin-off

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
of Darwinian
evolutionary theory,

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that human evolution
is a linear process,

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that it goes from stupid
caveman to smart old us

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
with our hydrogen bombs
and striped toothpaste.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the proof
that the Sphinx

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:84%
is many, many thousands
of years older,

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that it precedes by
many thousands of years,

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.214 align:middle line:84%
even dynastic Egypt,
means that-- and when

00:21:45.214 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:84%
that's taken into
consideration, and you

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
look at the way the
Sphinx is carved,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and the incredible size of
the blocks of the temple

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
alongside of it, when you
take that into consideration,

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:84%
you realize that there was at
some distant past and history,

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
as the legends affirm, high,
sophisticated civilizations.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's really what is
responsible ultimately

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.095 align:middle line:84%
for the terrific opposition
that the idea provokes.

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>As a direct result of
the raging controversy

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
in the press, both
sides were invited

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to debate the question of
the true age of the Sphinx.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:10%
The debate was held at
America's most prestigious

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:10%
scientific forum, the annual
meeting of the American

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:10%
Association for the
Advancement of Science.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptological
view was presented

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Mark Lehner,
considered to be the world's

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
foremost authority
on the Sphinx,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
West's theory was presented
by Dr. Robert Schoch,

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
while West watched the
proceedings from the audience.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Author Paul Roberts,
who was covering

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:84%
the debate for Canada's
leading investigative journal,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:90%
had these comments.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:10%
>>West is really an
academic's worst nightmare,

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:10%
because here comes
somebody way out

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:10%
of left field with a
thoroughly well-thought

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:10%
out, well-presented, coherently
described, beautifully written,

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:10%
full of data you can't
refute, and it pulls the rug

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:10%
from beneath your feet.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
So how do they deal with it?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.010 align:middle line:90%
They ignore it.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:90%
They hope it will go away.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And I won't go away.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:84%
If they'd allowed John
West to be on the podium,

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and not be kept off the podium
because he doesn't have degrees

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:84%
behind his name, they would have
had an even more devastating

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:84%
attack on, and they would have
been even less able to defend.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
As it was, they were
unable to respond

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.475 align:middle line:90%
to what Dr. Schoch said.

00:23:51.475 --> 00:23:54.272 align:middle line:10%
>>My own reaction,
as a non-geologist,

00:23:54.272 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:10%
was I was waiting to see
at least some hardcore

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:10%
data that the weathering
of the Sphinx is, in fact,

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:10%
water-induced,
induced by periods,

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.134 align:middle line:10%
by rain, such that it has
to date during a period

00:24:05.134 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:10%
when there were heavy rains.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see any evidence.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.724 align:middle line:84%
I saw many slides of, yes, this
drastically undulating profile

00:24:10.724 --> 00:24:13.705 align:middle line:84%
of what we call
[INAUDIBLE] of the Sphinx,

00:24:13.705 --> 00:24:17.975 align:middle line:84%
with various people,
standing in the view.

00:24:17.975 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't see any data that
convinces me one way or another

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.466 align:middle line:84%
that it is, in
fact, rain-induced.

00:24:22.466 --> 00:24:27.456 align:middle line:84%
Our reaction is, if it was built
by a civilization or a culture

00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:30.949 align:middle line:84%
that is that much early,
where is the other evidence

00:24:30.949 --> 00:24:31.947 align:middle line:90%
of this culture?

00:24:31.947 --> 00:24:34.315 align:middle line:90%
Show me a [INAUDIBLE] chart.

00:24:34.315 --> 00:24:35.939 align:middle line:84%
Show me a tomb, show
me an inscription.

00:24:35.939 --> 00:24:37.935 align:middle line:84%
Show me any other
piece of sculpture.

00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Show me any archaeological
site that dates to this period.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>To say, where's the
rest of the evidence,

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:84%
as a number of the
Egyptologists have said,

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:84%
it's like telling Magellan
that the world is still

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
flat because, where
are the other guys who

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:90%
sailed around it?

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely
beside the point.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:84%
However, I recognize that if the
Sphinx dated from that earlier

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
date, you would
anticipate that there

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
ought to be something
else, whereas if it dates

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
from a time so old that
practically everything has been

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:84%
sooted over, or covered over,
or in the bottom of what's now

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
the Mediterranean Sea, then
you get the idea that you might

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:84%
have to go looking very
hard for it, and perhaps

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:84%
even more to the point,
look in places where

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:90%
nobody else has looked.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:10%
One place I would
think to look would

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:10%
be wherever the course of
the old Nile Valley is.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
The Nile in ancient times was
not in its present course.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And wherever the
old Nile was would

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
be a place to go working
with our seismic equipment

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could find well
under the present silt level

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
remnants of a civilization
capable of producing something

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:90%
like the Sphinx.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the Osirian, thought
to have been building the New

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom 3,400 years ago.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Schoch and West
have found evidence

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
which casts a serious doubt
on this conventional dating.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>The floor of this
temple is a good 50 feet

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
below the floor of the
temple of Seti the First.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Geologically, there might be
another explanation for this.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I think it's possible that
this temple is extremely old.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:84%
It was built on
the ground level.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Then, over thousands of
years from Nile flooding,

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:84%
sands and silts were brought
in, which filled up the temple,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.725 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
covered it completely.

00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>We think this amazing
structure may relate

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:90%
to our work on the Sphinx.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It's traditionally attributed
to the Pharaoh Seti the First,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:84%
around 1,300 BC, but there's
virtually no evidence

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:90%
to support that attribution.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
We think it's older, maybe
thousands of years older.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>The Osirian looks like
it was built in a deep hole

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:90%
dug in the bedrock.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
This is an unthinkable departure
from normal Egyptian temple

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.762 align:middle line:90%
building practice.

00:26:50.762 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:84%
The architectural style is
unlike anything else in Egypt,

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:84%
except at Giza, the Valley
Temple of the Sphinx. .

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You can see the same
massive simplicity,

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
the mighty square granite
pillars, and the total absence

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of inscriptions and
carvings, all of which

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:84%
produce a very similar
initial impression.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Could this be more evidence
from the same culture

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.410 align:middle line:90%
that built the Sphinx?

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:84%
The Step Pyramid
at Saqqara is said

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to be older than the Sphinx
and the great pyramids at Giza.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Like the stones of
the Giza Plateau,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.370 align:middle line:84%
the mud bricks of Saqqara
have their own story to tell.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>These are the mud brick tombs
of the earliest kings of Egypt,

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
first and second
dynasties, around 3,000 BC,

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:84%
500 years before
Chephren's time.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Now under any circumstance,
if the limestone

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx carved out of is
harder than these mud bricks,

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
geologists agree, the
weatherings of the Sphinx

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
is the result of
water, rain water,

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Since we are only
10 miles from Giza,

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we can assume the weather
conditions are the same.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:84%
These mud brick walls are in
relatively stable condition

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.700 align:middle line:84%
after all these
thousands of years.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:84%
If they'd been subjected
to the same rains that

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:84%
weathered the Sphinx, they'd
have dissolved long ago.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible
that these mud brick

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
tombs and the limestone Sphinx
with channels weathered two

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and three feet deep
into its sides date

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:90%
from the same period?

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>When this photograph
was taken in 1860,

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:90%
the lion's body was not visible.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:84%
If the head of the Sphinx
hadn't protruded above the sand,

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.985 align:middle line:84%
it might not have been
discovered to this day.

00:29:07.985 --> 00:29:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Archaeological
excavation is expensive,

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and permission to dig in
Egypt is difficult to obtain.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.210 align:middle line:84%
How could West and his
team look beneath the sand

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:90%
without digging?

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
The seismograph is
connected to listening

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
devices called
geophones, which are

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:35.190 align:middle line:84%
placed in the ground
at precise intervals.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
A metal plate is hit
with a heavy hammer,

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.130 align:middle line:84%
sending shock waves
deep into the ground.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:10%
These shock waves reflect
off the rock layers

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:10%
of different densities that
are received by the geophones

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:10%
and then recorded
by the seismograph.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:10%
The final results give
a graphic representation

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.600 align:middle line:10%
of what lies hidden
beneath the surface.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Thomas Dobecki has been
a professor at the Colorado

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:84%
School of Mines, and
he's worked extensively

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:90%
in the petroleum industry.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:84%
He's a professional engineering
geologist and geophysicist.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
His specialty is high
resolution seismography.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:10%
>>Initially, our primary
purpose for conducting

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.940 align:middle line:10%
the seismic surveys in
and around the Sphinx

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.560 align:middle line:10%
was to look for buried evidence
for Ancient Civilizations.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:84%
To this end, we
were able to locate

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.320 align:middle line:84%
unusual cavities that could
be chambers within the Sphinx

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:90%
enclosure.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But over and above
this, we were also

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.256 align:middle line:84%
able to map the pattern
of weathering depth

00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:90%
within the limestone.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>This rock surface
may look rock solid,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually very soft.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.210 align:middle line:10%
It's porous,
geologically speaking.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:10%
Since it was cut out, it's
weathered in the subsurface.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Now a rock, when it's cut
out, begins to weather,

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and the degree of weathering,
the depth of weathering,

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
the subsurface
correlates very clearly

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.070 align:middle line:84%
with how long that
rock has been exposed.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:10%
>>By deterioration, or
weathering as we call it,

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:10%
the rock becomes softer.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Some of it dissolves.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a much weaker rock.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Now how deeply the weathering
goes into the rock mass

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:84%
is much a function
of the type of rock,

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.230 align:middle line:84%
but also very
importantly, how long

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.100 align:middle line:90%
it's exposed to the elements.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:10%
Now seismic
refraction enables us

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:10%
to map the boundary between
this weak deteriorated rock

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:37.180 align:middle line:10%
and the underlying
very hard-lined stone.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
What we found is that north
of the Sphinx along the body,

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:84%
south of the Sphinx, and
in front of the paws,

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.100 align:middle line:84%
the rock has weathered
down from the surface

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.400 align:middle line:90%
into the subsurface.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.410 align:middle line:84%
It's weathered down
approximately 2 to 2

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 meters, in some
places a little deeper.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:84%
We're talking in terms of six
to eight feet or so weathering.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Behind the rump of the
Sphinx, however, it's

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:84%
only weathered about
1.2 meters depth,

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe 1.5 meters in a couple
of spots, about 4 feet deep.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.060 align:middle line:84%
What this clearly
indicates to us

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the rump was
carved out later.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I think there's good reason
to believe that the back was

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.370 align:middle line:84%
carved out or cut out
in [INAUDIBLE] time,

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.706 align:middle line:84%
in Chephren's time, [INAUDIBLE]
or Chephren's time, about 2,500

00:32:25.706 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:84%
If the other three sides show
weathering 50% to 100% deeper,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I would expect that that
means that the other three

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:84%
sides were exposed or carved out
at least 50% to 100% earlier.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:10%
>>Simply stated, the
floor in the back

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.570 align:middle line:10%
was weathered only
to a depth of 4 feet,

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.030 align:middle line:10%
while the front was
weathered 8 feet.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.210 align:middle line:10%
This suggests that the
front of the Sphinx

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.570 align:middle line:10%
is twice as old as the back.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Assuming that Chephren
exposed the back

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
to make repairs 4,500
years ago, the front

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
must have been carved
out at least 7,000,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:84%
perhaps more than
9,000 years ago.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>How old is the Sphinx?

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists claim the Pharaoh
Chephren carved the Sphinx

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.040 align:middle line:84%
in his own image
4,500 years ago.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:10%
>>All Egyptologists,
and especially everyone

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:10%
who studied the Sphinx, and
all our critical evidence

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:10%
that we have, dated
the Sphinx back

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:10%
to 4,500 years ago, which
is the time of Chephren,

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:10%
the builder of the
Second Pyramid at Giza.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Even Mark Lehner, who
is a colleague of mine,

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.290 align:middle line:84%
tried to make a computer
modeling of the Sphinx,

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and through a
statue found-- it's

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.185 align:middle line:84%
now in the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston--

00:34:00.185 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:84%
he, with the
computer, they found

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:07.370 align:middle line:84%
that the face of the Sphinx now
exactly looked like Chephren.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>A National Geographic
article showed

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
the face of Chephren imposed
by a computer on the Sphinx.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.639 align:middle line:84%
According to Doctor Mark Lehner
with the face of Chephren,

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.270 align:middle line:90%
the Sphinx came alive.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:90%
Alive.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But does the face
of the Great Sphinx

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:84%
even resemble the
Pharaoh Chephren?

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.060 align:middle line:10%
The traditional
view says it does.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:10%
But to John West, that
answer was unsatisfactory.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:84%
He decided to consult
an expert, someone

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:40.480 align:middle line:90%
who works with faces every day.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:10%
New York City
detective Frank Domingo

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:10%
is one of America's
leading forensic experts.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:84%
A 26-year police veteran,
he wrote a manual

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
on the art and technique of
facial identification used

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.331 align:middle line:84%
today by police investigators
all across the nation.

00:34:56.331 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>If we had those photographs--

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>If anyone could tell if
the Sphinx was Chephren,

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.870 align:middle line:90%
it was Detective Frank Domingo.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The faces that I've seen
in Egypt are wonderful.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole myriad
of different racial types

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.511 align:middle line:84%
and different types
of facial features.

00:35:28.511 --> 00:35:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And in those features,
I've seen elements

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.545 align:middle line:84%
that I see in the statues
from ancient Egypt.

00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.595 align:middle line:84%
>>The Cairo Museum was
established in 1902,

00:35:41.595 --> 00:35:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and it contains the
largest collection

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.240 align:middle line:90%
of Egyptian art in the world.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The statues here in
the Old Kingdom Room

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.880 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate the skill with which
the ancient sculptors captured

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:90%
their subjects.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.480 align:middle line:84%
The eyes of this magnificent
wooden statue of [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:90%
seemed to look back at you.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The Old Kingdom artists
even used various crystals

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.516 align:middle line:84%
to simulate the refraction
of the human eye.

00:36:06.516 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Detective Domingo and team
photographer, Caroline Davies,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:84%
went to photograph and measure
the controversial statue

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Pharaoh Chephren.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Using standard police
procedure, Caroline

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:84%
photographed side and frontal
views eye level to the statue.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:84%
These mug shots
would be compared

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.600 align:middle line:90%
to similar views of the Sphinx.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:84%
In addition,
precise measurements

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.630 align:middle line:84%
of facial features and angular
proportions were taken.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:10%
If the face of the
Sphinx was meant

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.900 align:middle line:10%
to be the Pharaoh Chephren,
then it should resemble

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.170 align:middle line:10%
his statue in the Cairo Museum,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:10%
>>One of the questions we
often get about Egyptian art

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:10%
is, just how lifelike is it?

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:10%
How accurately does it
reproduce the physical features

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:10%
of the subjects that
are represented?

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, we often hear
that Egyptian art

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.270 align:middle line:90%
is purely symmetrical.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You can draw a
vertical line bisecting

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:84%
the nose on the statue, and
all the features on the right

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:84%
would be the mirror images
of those on the left.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's absolutely wrong.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.030 align:middle line:84%
If you, in fact, do
find a statue that

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.959 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely symmetrical, where
all the features on the right

00:37:15.959 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:84%
are different from those on the
left, you know what you have?

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:90%
You have forgery.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the Egyptians
were very canny

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:84%
observers of the
human condition.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.674 align:middle line:84%
They realized that
one eye on a face

00:37:26.674 --> 00:37:28.590 align:middle line:84%
is always a little bit
lower than another eye.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:84%
One nostril may be a little bit
larger than another nostril.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.105 align:middle line:90%
And they showed those details.

00:37:34.105 --> 00:37:49.380 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:10%
>>Look at the prognathism
on the Sphinx.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:55.190 align:middle line:10%
That's the extension of the
lower portion of the face.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:84%
You won't find that on
the statue of Chephren.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:84%
This statue does not protrude
at this part of the face.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Frank also observed that
the face of the Sphinx

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:10.390 align:middle line:84%
is more square, while
Chephren's face is more oval.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Proportionately, the
mouth of the Sphinx

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
is larger, while Chephren's
mouth is a little finer.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.080 align:middle line:84%
The eyes of the Sphinx are
quite large in comparison

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to those of Chephren.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.890 align:middle line:84%
After completing his initial
observations in Egypt,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Detective Domingo
returned to New York

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:90%
to analyze his findings.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Does the Sphinx look a
little worried to you?

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what the penalty is
for impersonating a Pharaoh.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.920 align:middle line:84%
The procedure for measuring
proportions, angles, and shapes

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:84%
had to be established before
a comparison could be made.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:39:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Comparison of the
facial shapes was

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.770 align:middle line:84%
made more difficult due
to the severe damage

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Sphinx.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, detective Domingo
established enough points

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.300 align:middle line:84%
of reference to make a
comparison with the statue

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:90%
of Chepren possible.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.620 align:middle line:84%
These points were the chin,
the outer corner of the eye,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.565 align:middle line:90%
and the brow ridge.

00:39:21.565 --> 00:39:25.432 align:middle line:90%


00:39:25.432 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:84%
While the study of
the frontal view

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:84%
showed significant
differences, the comparison

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.900 align:middle line:84%
of the lateral
view was decisive.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:10%
When the reference points
in this lateral view

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.040 align:middle line:10%
were connected with vertical
and horizontal lines,

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.370 align:middle line:10%
the difference of angles on
the two works was extreme.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.070 align:middle line:10%
The most conclusive finding was
the angle between the outer eye

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:10%
and the vertical.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:53.520 align:middle line:10%
In Chephren, that angle measured
14 degrees, but on the Sphinx,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.315 align:middle line:10%
the angle was more than
double, 32 degrees.

00:39:55.315 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.160 align:middle line:84%
This explains the
protrusion of the lower

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:84%
jaw found on the Sphinx,
but not on Chephren.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>After reviewing all
the measurements, angles,

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and proportions,
it's my conclusion

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that the Great
Sphinx of Giza is not

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
the same individual represented
in the statue of the Pharaoh

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Chephren.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>If the Sphinx isn't
Chephren, who is it?

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Some eminent visitors
over the years,

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.670 align:middle line:84%
among them Gustav
[INAUDIBLE], thought

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:38.220 align:middle line:90%
the Sphinx was Black African.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:84%
According to Zulu
history, in ancient times,

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
their people inhabited
Northern Africa.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.060 align:middle line:84%
When the rain stopped and
the region became Sahara,

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:90%
the Zulu migrated south.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.140 align:middle line:90%
This view now has some support.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.480 align:middle line:84%
In his detailed
report, Frank Domingo

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the
face of the Sphinx

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.366 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with typical
African facial structure.

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:10%
After "The New York Times"
published its op-ed piece

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.400 align:middle line:10%
on Domingo's work,
orthodontist Sheldon Peck

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.550 align:middle line:10%
wrote a letter,
independently arriving

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.340 align:middle line:10%
at the same conclusion.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.380 align:middle line:10%
Orthodontists work with
facial bone structure

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.460 align:middle line:10%
on a day-to-day basis.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be a
twist on history,

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:84%
if the face of the Sphinx was
meant to represent a Black

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:90%
African King or Queen?

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:10%
>>It is interesting that
the Zulus in their myths

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.210 align:middle line:10%
and traditions identify their
beginnings with the planet

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.010 align:middle line:10%
Mars.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:10%
There was a great war, and
the most beautiful women were

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.910 align:middle line:10%
placed upon what they
called [NON-ENGLISH],

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.350 align:middle line:10%
the spaceship that brought
them from Mars to this planet.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.080 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting that this word
is very similar to the Hebrew

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:84%
word, [NON-ENGLISH], which
means the divine vehicle,

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
used by the angels or higher
intelligence in visiting

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.740 align:middle line:90%
the human creation.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:12.290 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:16.510 align:middle line:84%
All the monuments in the Giza
Plateau are carved in stone.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But some of the theories
explaining them are not.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the main arguments
that the Sphinx was

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.050 align:middle line:84%
carved by Chephren is found
on this granite stela.

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:31.440 align:middle line:84%
This tablet tells how the
Sphinx appeared to Tuthmosis IV

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.540 align:middle line:84%
in a dream, and promised
him the crown of Egypt

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:84%
if he would remove the
sand that covered it.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyphics read, "Look
at me, Tuthmosis Moses, my son.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I am your father
Horace in the horizon.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.840 align:middle line:84%
To you I turn my face
and heart for protection,

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.800 align:middle line:90%
since I am sick in all my limbs.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:84%
The sands of the sanctuary on
which I rest have covered me."

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Tuthmosis Moses cleared away
the sand and indeed became King.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.830 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But what does this stela
actually say about Chephren?

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.200 align:middle line:84%
On the bottom of this
tablet, there once

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:84%
existed a few of the hieroglyphs
that make up Chephren's name.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:90%
They have since flaked off.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But nowhere does the stela
say anything about Chephren

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:24.500 align:middle line:90%
carving the Sphinix.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists continue to use
this circumstantial evidence

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.810 align:middle line:84%
in their argument
that the Sphinx was

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:90%
carved in his lifetime.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.780 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
here's another piece

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.590 align:middle line:84%
of circumstantial
evidence, which

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:84%
would have proved West's
theory, if scholars

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:90%
had chosen to accept it.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Here's a tantalizing,
but inconclusive piece

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.380 align:middle line:90%
of the puzzle.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the Inventory stela It
relates how King [INAUDIBLE],

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:84%
predecessor to Chephren,
and build a temple to Isis

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.380 align:middle line:90%
alongside the Sphinx.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:84%
This means that the Sphinx was
there before Chephren's time.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.430 align:middle line:84%
The stela, however, is a later
version of an earlier document.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Scholars argue over
the authenticity

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:90%
of the information it contains.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:84%
There is, however,
good reason to believe

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:90%
that information is authentic.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:10%
>>But the inventory stela has
a very unique inscription.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.110 align:middle line:10%
It is a piece of fine
white limestone some 70

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:10%
by 42 centimeters.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.200 align:middle line:84%
In layman's language,
it refers to Khufu,

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the father of
Chephren, as the one

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:30.420 align:middle line:84%
who creates the temple next
to the cavity of the Sphinx.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, this
throws into question

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.320 align:middle line:90%
the origin of the Sphinx.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.390 align:middle line:84%
It points to a much
earlier point of time.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Scholars have
rejected this because

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.010 align:middle line:84%
of the modern stylized
Egyptian writing.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.940 align:middle line:84%
But this would be like throwing
out the King James Bible simply

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.510 align:middle line:84%
because it is in modern
English, overlooking

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:51.750 align:middle line:84%
the prime revelatory source
of cosmology and theology.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>The ancient
Egyptians were masters

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:84%
at building with
large blocks of stone.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Visitors from all
around the world

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:84%
are still impressed by
these magnificent structures

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.360 align:middle line:90%
built thousands of years ago.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid
of Giza is perhaps

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.350 align:middle line:90%
the most famous example.

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2 million
blocks of limestone

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.110 align:middle line:90%
are stacked 480 feet high.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.066 align:middle line:84%
The average weight of the
blocks is 2 and 1/2 tons.

00:45:28.066 --> 00:45:30.820 align:middle line:84%
The interior chambers
are lined with blocks

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.210 align:middle line:90%
which weigh up to 70 tons each.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:84%
As impressive as
these numbers, there's

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.150 align:middle line:84%
an even greater
mystery, which until now

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:42.450 align:middle line:90%
has been completely overlooked.

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:84%
In order to expose the
body of the Sphinx,

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:51.560 align:middle line:84%
enormous blocks of
limestone were quarried out.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Block by block, the
stone was removed

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.457 align:middle line:90%
as the lion's shape took form.

00:45:55.457 --> 00:46:02.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm standing here on the
walls of the Sphinx enclosure.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a massive
limestone temple

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that was built contemporaneously
with the Sphinx.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We know that because we
can look at the rocks

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that this is made
out of, and we see

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that it has exactly the
same layers, exactly

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.750 align:middle line:90%
the same lithology.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we can determine that
these blocks came right out

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx enclosure.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:84%
They actually carved
out massive blocks,

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.630 align:middle line:84%
which they moved to
and from the Sphinx

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and reassembled as
the Sphinx temple.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And the size of these
blocks really is enormous.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
How were they able to
move these huge blocks

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.460 align:middle line:84%
with quote, "primitive
technology?"

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:43.010 align:middle line:84%
How were they able to assemble
them into this temple?

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It really awes and
inspires the imagination.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Some of these blocks measure
30 feet long, 10 feet high,

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.340 align:middle line:90%
and 12 feet wide.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.500 align:middle line:90%
They each weigh 200 tons.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:00.210 align:middle line:84%
That's roughly the weight
of a diesel locomotive.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere else in all
of Egypt are blocks

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:06.570 align:middle line:84%
this size used in the
construction of temple walls.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.640 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how were
these giant blocks moved

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.340 align:middle line:84%
onto this site, then raised, and
precisely fitted into position

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.705 align:middle line:90%
50 feet above the ground?

00:47:14.705 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists maintain that it
was done with ramps, levers,

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.730 align:middle line:90%
ropes, and a lot of manpower.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.620 align:middle line:84%
To put the problem
in perspective,

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:84%
John went to a Long
Island construction site

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:39.140 align:middle line:84%
to see how today's engineers
lift and maneuver heavy loads.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.500 align:middle line:84%
A crew of 20 men have
been working for six weeks

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for the lift of
one object, a 200 ton boiler.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:84%
This crane is one of the largest
land-based cranes in existence.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Its boom reaches 220
feet into the air.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:59.630 align:middle line:84%
A concrete counter
weight of 160 tons

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:03.100 align:middle line:84%
is required to keep
it from tipping over.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.500 align:middle line:84%
A second crane was
needed to precisely fit

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.970 align:middle line:90%
the boiler into place.

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm looking at what
you're showing me here,

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:15.390 align:middle line:84%
these pieces, and looking
at the distance involved.

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we would be
able to pick if any of these

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.577 align:middle line:84%
are 200 tons from the position
that I see available to us.

00:48:22.577 --> 00:48:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've looked at
these over the years.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:27.160 align:middle line:10%
Because in my business,
when we take heavy loads,

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.640 align:middle line:10%
we look to see how heavy loads
were picked by other people

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:34.030 align:middle line:10%
before us, and seeing how they
moved these heavy blocks, 200

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:37.690 align:middle line:10%
ton blocks, possibly thousands
and thousands of years ago.

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how
they did this job.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:41.996 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:48:41.996 --> 00:48:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And it will probably always
be a mystery to me, and maybe

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to everybody.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>If modern engineers
have a problem maneuvering

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.160 align:middle line:84%
blocks of that size, how
were the ancient builders

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.346 align:middle line:90%
able to do it?

00:48:56.346 --> 00:49:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Was it possible to move
200 ton blocks into place

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.910 align:middle line:84%
using simple levers, as
Egyptologists suggest?

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Or did they possess a technology
that our science is only

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:11.030 align:middle line:84%
beginning to understand,
a technology based

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.630 align:middle line:90%
on the vibrations of sound?

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Project Director Boris
Said demonstrates

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Egyptians
understood acoustic principles,

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and they incorporated them
in their architecture.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.370 align:middle line:84%
This broken obelisk
still resonates

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.150 align:middle line:84%

a giant tuning fork.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.693 align:middle line:84%
For many of us,
this is levitation.

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:54.870 align:middle line:84%
But the scientists at the
Space Age Research Facility

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.070 align:middle line:84%
outside of Chicago have
a different definition

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.610 align:middle line:90%
of levitation.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Acoustic levitation
is a non-magical way

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:06.300 align:middle line:84%
of floating an object in
mid-air using a very loud sound.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:16.050 align:middle line:84%
The levitation that we do is
done by having one or two sound

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:18.870 align:middle line:90%
sources and a reflector.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And the sound bounces off
the reflector, and on its way

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.600 align:middle line:84%
back down, the two sound
fields pass through each other.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.500 align:middle line:10%
In that region where there is
the interference of those two

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.830 align:middle line:10%
sound fields, there
are little wells

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:35.600 align:middle line:10%

I'd love to go to Egypt,
but lifting the block

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is a little beyond what
we can do currently.

The frequency
required is much lower

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.880 align:middle line:10%
than we can produce at
sufficient intensity,

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.280 align:middle line:10%
and the reflector that you'd
have to have above the object

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:09.180 align:middle line:10%
would be approximately a
quarter of a mile across.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Today's most advanced science
can levitate a small rock,

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but nothing that compares
with the blocks in the Sphinx

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.800 align:middle line:90%
and valley temples.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.750 align:middle line:84%
The fact remains these
200 ton blocks of stone

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.320 align:middle line:84%
were somehow raised and fitted
together with great precision.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.300 align:middle line:84%
No one today knows
just how this was done.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:37.660 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.650 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Sphinx, you may

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:43.750 align:middle line:84%
notice that the head seems
too small for the body.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Detective Domingo reasoned
that if the Sphinx was carved

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:48.910 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of
a lion, it should

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:middle line:84%
be consistent with the
proportions of a real lion.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Although much of the
Sphinx is eroded away,

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Domingo found four
valid reference points

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.700 align:middle line:90%
for his comparison.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And those points confirm
that the base was indeed

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:05.090 align:middle line:84%
in correct proportion
to a lion's body.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But the Sphinx has the head of
a human when Domingo compared

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.320 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions of the Sphinx to
a typical Sphinx at the Cairo

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Museum, he found that
their bases were also

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:90%
in correct proportion.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.391 align:middle line:84%
Why, then, were the
heads so different?

00:53:19.391 --> 00:53:22.340 align:middle line:90%


00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Domingo speculated that because
the original head was already

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:29.050 align:middle line:84%
so eroded by rain, it had
to be recarved in order

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:32.760 align:middle line:90%
to create the face we see today.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>The symbol of
the Sphinx uniquely

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:39.750 align:middle line:84%
brings together the Sphinx
as the guardian of knowledge,

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the sentinel of the
opening of the door

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:45.270 align:middle line:84%
to higher knowledge, the
power of human nature--

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that is to say, the face
of human intelligence,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.740 align:middle line:84%
connected with the
body of the lion,

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.410 align:middle line:84%
the forces of nature
that are put in balance,

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.920 align:middle line:84%
with that of the solar
system, or the greater

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.110 align:middle line:90%
notion of life in the universe.

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:00.440 align:middle line:84%
All three themes are
brought together in one.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It is the perfect symbol of
initiation into life eternal.

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:06.910 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:09.360 align:middle line:84%
In the days before
cameras and video,

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.290 align:middle line:84%
people had to rely on
the descriptive abilities

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:14.640 align:middle line:84%
of those intrepid
tourists who actually

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.830 align:middle line:90%
got to see the Great Sphinx.

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:20.724 align:middle line:84%
These descriptions were
sometimes very poetic.

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.220 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, the
mysteries of Egypt

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.720 align:middle line:84%
have drawn visitors from
all over the world, Benjamin

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Franklin, Napoleon,
Florence Nightingale.

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They came to enjoy the
culture of ancient Egypt.

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Today, travelers
find a country which

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:59.572 align:middle line:90%
is still rich in tradition.

00:54:59.572 --> 00:55:02.570 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians are
warm, friendly people.

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.415 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, masters of
the fine art of bargaining.

00:55:09.415 --> 00:55:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>I prefer Nefertiti.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:11.100 align:middle line:90%
I prefer Nefertiti.

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.140 align:middle line:90%
She's more beautiful--

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>But of course, it's
really the monuments

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:17.716 align:middle line:90%
they're coming to see.

00:55:17.716 --> 00:55:22.490 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians consider them to
be the heritage of humanity.

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:26.130 align:middle line:84%
They generously share them
with the entire world.

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Restoring and maintaining
these treasures

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is the enormous task of
the Egyptians Antiquities

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Organization.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Said Hegazy
voices his concern.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.880 align:middle line:10%
>>You know we can that
we live in the present,

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.260 align:middle line:10%
but we also live in the past.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:84%
There is much that we
can learn about ourselves

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:46.380 align:middle line:90%
by studying the past.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.500 align:middle line:84%
These monuments are
the past, and they

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.300 align:middle line:84%
must survive for
hundreds of years

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.460 align:middle line:84%
so new generations
can know them.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.800 align:middle line:84%
These temples have been
deteriorating for centuries.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It's our duty to protect them
against further destruction,

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:01.609 align:middle line:84%
and to do our best
to restore them.

00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>It was here in Luxor, on a
casual tourist visit in 1937,

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that RA Schwaller de Lubicz
conceived of the notion

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that this strange
asymmetric ruin behind us,

00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:49.390 align:middle line:84%
the Temple of Luxor, was in
fact an exercise in harmony

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:50.700 align:middle line:90%
and proportion.

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Since both these were
supposedly Greek inventions,

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Schwaller decided to stay in
Luxor to test his hypothesis.

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:00.580 align:middle line:84%
For if he could prove that
harmony and proportion were

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.860 align:middle line:84%
available to the
ancient Egyptians,

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.710 align:middle line:84%
it would mean that exact
mathematical scientific

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:08.310 align:middle line:84%
knowledge existed
a full 1,000 years

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:11.810 align:middle line:90%
before the rise of Greece.

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Over the course of
15 years, Schwaller

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.788 align:middle line:84%
measured and mathematically
analyzed this temple structure.

00:57:16.788 --> 00:57:19.420 align:middle line:90%


00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:22.410 align:middle line:84%
He found that it was based on
strict geometrical and harmonic

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.790 align:middle line:90%
proportions.

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Through his
observations, Schwaller

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:28.460 align:middle line:84%
discovered that the walls,
columns, and sanctuaries

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.810 align:middle line:84%
tell the story of
the creation of man

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and his relationship
to the universe.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The very proportions
of man are embodied

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in the floor plan of
this monument, which

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.093 align:middle line:84%
is why Schwaller called
it the Temple of Man.

00:57:41.093 --> 00:57:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Could the complex
knowledge expressed

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:49.540 align:middle line:84%
in this temple, which
we're only beginning

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:53.027 align:middle line:84%
to grasp today, be a legacy
from the builders of the Sphinx

00:57:53.027 --> 00:57:53.985 align:middle line:90%
and its temple complex?

00:57:53.985 --> 00:57:57.790 align:middle line:90%


00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:59.850 align:middle line:84%
For those who visit
this sacred site,

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:02.160 align:middle line:84%
it evokes a strange
vitality which

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.915 align:middle line:84%
can be unsettling,
yet exhilarating.

00:58:03.915 --> 00:58:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Architecture has been
called frozen music,

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and Luxor, even in ruins,
is a symphony in stone.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:36.530 align:middle line:84%
To the thousands of tourists
who visit the Sphinx every day,

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:40.210 align:middle line:84%
it appears to have been
built from blocks of stone.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.160 align:middle line:84%
In actuality, the
blocks were used

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.160 align:middle line:84%
to repair the heavily
eroded body of the Sphinx.

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.310 align:middle line:84%
For West and his team,
these repair blocks

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:51.190 align:middle line:84%
contain a valuable clue
which other experts have not

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.600 align:middle line:90%
taken into account.

00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>The deeply weathered
body of the Sphinx

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:58.740 align:middle line:84%
has been repaired many
times throughout the course

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.170 align:middle line:90%
of its long history.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Each of these repair campaigns
has its own individual style.

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Here's the tale of the Sphinx.

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And right above it,
various repairs.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.836 align:middle line:84%
Right on the tail,
different styles,

00:59:13.836 --> 00:59:14.960 align:middle line:90%
different types of repairs.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.560 align:middle line:84%
This is obviously a
much older repair block.

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:22.890 align:middle line:84%
These are more recent
ones, 20th century repairs.

00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists have determined
that some of these oldest

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.840 align:middle line:84%
repairs date back to
Old Kingdom times.

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So this statue, this
magnificent monument,

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.870 align:middle line:84%
has had people working
on it, repairing it,

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:41.140 align:middle line:90%
for the last 4,500 years.

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Here, we're looking at a
cross-section of the repairs.

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.880 align:middle line:10%
In order to restore the Sphinx
to its original lion's form,

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.630 align:middle line:10%
2 to 3 feet of repair
blocks were necessary.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:55.310 align:middle line:10%
>>Egyptologists tell us that the
earliest repairs of the Sphinx

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:57.030 align:middle line:10%
were made during
the Old Kingdom,

00:59:57.030 --> 01:00:01.520 align:middle line:10%
and this period ended around
300 years after Chephren died.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.460 align:middle line:90%
This presents a problem.

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:07.160 align:middle line:84%
If Chephren carved the Sphinx,
why would it need repairs

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.694 align:middle line:90%
after only 300 years?

01:00:08.694 --> 01:00:11.360 align:middle line:90%


01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.110 align:middle line:84%
They say that the stone
the Sphinx carved is from

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:19.000 align:middle line:84%
was of such poor quality that
it eroded 3 feet in 300 years.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
That's an erosion rate
of approximately one foot

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.510 align:middle line:90%
every 100 years.

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.920 align:middle line:10%
The Sphinx, we're told,
is 4,500 years old.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
That totals 45 feet of erosion.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.930 align:middle line:10%
Since the Sphinx is
only 40 feet wide,

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.100 align:middle line:10%
it would have completely
disappeared 500 years ago.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%


01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
One explanation for the
formation of the Sphinx

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
was provided by Farouk al
Baz, a world-renowned Egyptian

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:52.390 align:middle line:90%
geoologist.

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:55.140 align:middle line:90%


01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.190 align:middle line:84%
He noticed the very ancient
water weathering patterns

01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
on the body of the
Sphinx and suggested

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that the Sphinx was a yardang.

01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
A yardang is a land form
shaped by natural forces,

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.810 align:middle line:90%
such as wind-driven sand.

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
These forces,
according to Elbaz,

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
gave the land form
its basic shape,

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.900 align:middle line:84%
which the Egyptians
merely modified to create

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.028 align:middle line:90%
the Sphinx we see today.

01:01:18.028 --> 01:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%


01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>And he shows this
diagramatically.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Here's sort of a
lump of rock that

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.550 align:middle line:90%
was sticking out of the desert.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
The winds flow around
it, start to shape it,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
make it look more and
more like a Sphinx,

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and then the Egyptians came
and touched it up a little bit

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.220 align:middle line:84%
to make it into the
Sphinx we see today.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:43.980 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Relative to the yardang
hypothesis suggested

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
by Farouk al Baz, I
really don't think this

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.510 align:middle line:90%
holds under close scrutiny.

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
One reason is as you look
at the Sphinx enclosure,

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and here we see the rear
of the Sphinx enclosure,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx is cut
out of the bedrock

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and the ditch, the
enclosure surrounding it,

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:07.090 align:middle line:84%
is very tight, is very narrow,
and it has these sharp right

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.400 align:middle line:90%
angles in it as you see here.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to conceive of
how natural processes would

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
cut it so tightly and cut
these sharp right angles.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, the
blocks, at least some

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
of the blocks that were cut
out of the Sphinx' ditch,

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
were used to build temples that
sit in front of the Sphinx,

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
so it's very hard to conceive of
how natural process would have

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:33.102 align:middle line:84%
cut blocks out, removed them,
and reassembled them as temples

01:02:33.102 --> 01:02:34.060 align:middle line:90%
in front of the Sphinx.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:46.550 align:middle line:90%


01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Also, the head of
the Sphinx does

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
sit above the general level of
the Giza Plateau in this area,

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and the head may have, in
fact, originated as a yardang.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe that the
body as a whole was a yardang.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Hawass has his own ideas
about how the Sphinx was made.

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
He describes how the
sculptor may have

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
worked on the great statue.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.060 align:middle line:10%
>>He made the face
of the Sphinx,

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.850 align:middle line:10%
but he found that the
whole body is deteriorated.

01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Then he cased the
Sphinx with rocks,

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
with limestone, and after
that, made the carving.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>In other words,
the limestone was so

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
deteriorated that
the sculptors had

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
to repair the body while
they were carving it.

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Schoch carefully
examined the stone

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and came to a very
different conclusion.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>>You look at these blocks,
you can see the strata,

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.570 align:middle line:10%
you can see the
fossils, the nummulites.

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly the same rock
as the Sphinx enclosure, really

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
a fairly nice
limestone, good solid,

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
certainly capable of using it
to build a structure like this.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Certainly not the
situation where it just

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
powders and crumbles
immediately upon cutting it out.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
If that were the
case, they wouldn't

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
be able to use it to
assemble a temple like this.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>According to Schoch
and West, at the time

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Chephren became
Pharaoh, the Sphinx

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
was already highly eroded from
thousands of years of rainfall.

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:17.544 align:middle line:84%
Chephren didn't build the
Sphinx, he repaired it.

01:04:17.544 --> 01:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
He also repaired the Sphinx
and the Valley Temple,

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
which were already highly
eroded when he became Pharaoh.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
How do we know this?

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>This is an inscription found
on the granite of the Valley

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Temple, and its style is
typical of the Old Kingdom work.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Roughly translated it says,
"Beloved of, living forever."

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
What it says to us, however,
is that this granite was here

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:47.390 align:middle line:90%
in the Old Kingdom times.

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we've established
that the limestone core

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
blocks of the temple are
much older than this granite.

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
If this granite was here in
Old Kingdom times, the temple

01:04:56.850 --> 01:05:01.240 align:middle line:84%
itself must have been
built considerably earlier.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a side
view of the Valley

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Temple, one of the sides
of the Valley Temple.

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
It was stripped of its
granite ashlar some time ago,

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and they were used to
reconstruct and to build

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.320 align:middle line:84%
other structures
in the Cairo area.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you see under
the granite ashlar

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
is this rough, higgledy
piggledy surface.

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And what I interpret
this as representing

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
is the ancient Egyptians
had a weathered surface

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
on a very old temple.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
They cut it back
just a little bit

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to get a more complex
surface before covering it

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:35.404 align:middle line:90%
with the granite ashlar.

01:05:35.404 --> 01:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
cut it back enough

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:40.627 align:middle line:90%
to make a nice, smooth surface.

01:05:40.627 --> 01:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Now this is what I mean by
the two stage construction.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.310 align:middle line:84%
You see the huge
core blocks that

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
come from that ditch
that was quarried out

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to free the granite,
and the granite seeding

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that was added later is
exactly the same thing

01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:53.890 align:middle line:84%
over here with the
granite sheeting,

01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:55.545 align:middle line:90%
and the limestone blocks on top.

01:05:55.545 --> 01:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And my contention is that the
current limestone core blocks

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
originally had that
rolling weathering

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.890 align:middle line:90%
that you see on the swings.

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
The weathering was cut off,
and the granite was then

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:06.620 align:middle line:90%
married to the limestone core.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>I agree.

01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you as a geologist tell
if the limestone is actually

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.780 align:middle line:90%
pretty weathered?

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
it's old limestone

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.570 align:middle line:90%
when the granite is put on?

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I think so.

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:18.495 align:middle line:84%
Because on the other side,
where the granite facing

01:06:18.495 --> 01:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
has been removed, you can
see the limestone surface

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
very clearly, and you
can see that there

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
was an old weathered
feature there

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
which was just sort of skimmed
down, cut up down a little bit,

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:29.841 align:middle line:84%
in order to put the
new granite on it.

01:06:29.841 --> 01:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
back of the granite

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
was cut to fit the
old weathered surface,

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.400 align:middle line:84%
so it's impossible to have
built it all at one time

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and get that effect.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
You had to put the
limestone there

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
first, let it weather for
a long period of time,

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and then marry
the granite to it.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
My feeling was this was an
important piece of the puzzle.

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>I think so.

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:47.138 align:middle line:90%
>>Let me show you another one.

01:06:47.138 --> 01:06:47.938 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:06:47.938 --> 01:07:00.420 align:middle line:90%


01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a picture of a
wall of the Valley Temple.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can see,
for instance here,

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
how the granite
seems to have been

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
cut to meet the weathered
limestone, the older

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:13.150 align:middle line:90%
limestone surface.

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
This two-stage construction
of the Sphinx Temple and also

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the Valley Temple is something
that greatly impressed me

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
on my first trip
to Egypt and led

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
me to believe that this project
was worth pursuing further.

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>When Chephren's stonemasons
refaced the two temples,

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.040 align:middle line:90%
they needed room to work.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
They cut back the
limestone bedrock,

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:38.540 align:middle line:90%
creating this shear wall.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>This vertical wall is what the
walls of this Sphinx enclosure

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
would have looked
like originally.

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Now traditional
Egyptologists argue

01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:49.530 align:middle line:84%
that this wall was carved out
at the same time as the walls

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx enclosure,
and also at the same time

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
as this wall made out
of the same material.

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a wall of
the Sphinx temple.

01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Notice how eroded it is.

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is not even
all the original rotation,

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.720 align:middle line:84%
because some of it was cut
off by the ancient Egyptians,

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
we believe, when they
restored this temple.

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Now my contention
is that clearly,

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
this wall and the nice
vertical wall that we

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
see here, plus the walls of
the Sphinx enclosure, these

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
could not have been
made at the same time.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the more
heavily eroded walls

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
are older than
this vertical wall.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:47.500 align:middle line:90%


01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>What you've just seen is the
result of 17 years of research.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
To visualize how this new
information fits together,

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
we've created a computer
graphic sequence

01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate the possible
life history of the Sphinx.

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:04.340 align:middle line:90%


01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Long ago, before
Egypt became a desert,

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
the Giza Plateau was
a fertile savanna.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
At the very edge of this
plateau was a large outcrop

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.331 align:middle line:90%
of natural rock.

01:09:15.331 --> 01:09:18.250 align:middle line:90%


01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.189 align:middle line:84%
A group of sculptors
taking advantage

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:24.020 align:middle line:84%
of its prominent location carved
this rock into a gigantic face.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:32.540 align:middle line:90%


01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Originally, it may have
been the face of a lion,

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.508 align:middle line:84%
or it might have been
the face of a god,

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:44.000 align:middle line:90%
or the face of a queen.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
To create the lion's
body, blocks of limestone

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:51.279 align:middle line:84%
were quarried out, forming an
enclosure around the Sphinx.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, these huge blocks
were transported and lifted

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:59.530 align:middle line:84%
into position creating the
Sphinx and Valley Temples.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Time passed.

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Shifting weather patterns
from torrential rains

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to the, area signaling
the end of the Ice Age.

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
The rains eroded the Sphinx
to virtually the state

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.870 align:middle line:90%
it's in today.

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.570 align:middle line:90%


01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Could this have been the great
flood described in the Bible?

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.200 align:middle line:90%


01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.100 align:middle line:84%
When the rains stopped, the
vast, once fertile savanna

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.410 align:middle line:90%
became the Sahara desert.

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:30.300 align:middle line:90%


01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The wind-blown sands filled in
the heavily weathered enclosure

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and buried the statue
up to its neck.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.910 align:middle line:84%
This thick blanket of
sand protected the Sphinx

01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:41.055 align:middle line:84%
from further erosion
for thousands of years.

01:10:41.055 --> 01:10:43.320 align:middle line:90%


01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
But

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.280 align:middle line:90%
What about the face?

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Almost certainly, it's been
recarved, maybe several times.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Since nothing's been found
to identify the Sphinx,

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.406 align:middle line:84%
we may never know who it
was meant to represent.

01:10:55.406 --> 01:10:57.984 align:middle line:90%


01:10:57.984 --> 01:10:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Under the reign of
the Pharoah Chephren,

01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx was uncovered,
and the first of many repairs

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:05.680 align:middle line:90%
was begun.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Time passed.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:11.270 align:middle line:90%
The desert reclaimed the Sphinx.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years, Tuthmosis IV
again uncovered and repaired

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%
the great statue.

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
This cycle was
repeated several times

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.320 align:middle line:90%
over the next 3,500 years.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
There are many stories about
how the Sphinx lost its nose.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Some legends suggest
it was Napoleon's army.

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Others say that arrow
gunners were to blame.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
According to ancient
lore, you could

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:40.622 align:middle line:84%
kill the spirit of a statue
by destroying its nose.

01:11:40.622 --> 01:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
But the spirit of this
great statue lives on.

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:48.170 align:middle line:90%


01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
The computer re-creation
we've just seen

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
illustrates the
history of the Sphinx

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
according to Dr.
Schoch and John West.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't address the
question, who built the Sphinx?

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.500 align:middle line:10%
>>I think our initial
investigation around the Sphinx

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.040 align:middle line:10%
was very successful
from a couple

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.460 align:middle line:10%
of different perspectives.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
One, we got hard,
defensible data

01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:10.840 align:middle line:84%
on the degree and the nature of
the weathering of the limestone

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the
Sphinx, all of which

01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:15.850 align:middle line:90%
supports Bob Schoch's theories.

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But even more exciting
and more interesting to me

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
is the unexpected discovery
of several large cavity

01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:27.759 align:middle line:84%
features around and
under the Sphinx.

01:12:27.759 --> 01:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
This is a fairly large feature.

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
It's about 9 meters by
12 meters in dimension,

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and buried less than
5 meters in depth.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Now the regular shape
of this rectangular

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is inconsistent with
naturally occurring cavities,

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
so there's some suggestion
this could be man-made.

01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Man-made.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.570 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Keep that in mind
for just a minute.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.300 align:middle line:84%
There have been many
predictions about the role

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx would
play in our future.

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the most compelling
was by this man.

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce gained a
popularity in the mid-40's

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.610 align:middle line:90%
as America's sleeping prophet.

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:08.350 align:middle line:84%
In deep trance, Cayce
revealed detailed information

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.680 align:middle line:90%
about ancient Egypt.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.610 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, Cayce
predicted that a chamber

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
would be found under the
front paws of the Sphinx.

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
This chamber, he
said, would contain

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:20.190 align:middle line:84%
records of the
civilization that inspired

01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:22.310 align:middle line:90%
the entire Egyptian culture.

01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:25.270 align:middle line:84%
He called that
civilization Atlantis.

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
According to Cayce,
the Atlanteans

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:29.980 align:middle line:84%
were a technologically
advanced society

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.670 align:middle line:84%
who fled to Egypt when
their continent of Atlantis

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
sank into the ocean
to be lost forever.

01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Fantasy?

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Wild dreams?

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But the unexpected
cavities detected

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:46.130 align:middle line:84%
by the seismograph
were located precisely

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
were Edgar Cayce
said they would be,

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
under the front paws
of the Great Sphinx.

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.978 align:middle line:90%
A seismograph does not dream.

01:13:53.978 --> 01:13:59.910 align:middle line:90%


01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
If the Greeks were
inspired by the Egyptians,

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptians were inspired
by the mythological Atlanteans,

01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
then who inspired
the Atlanteans?

01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the most unusual
and intriguing ideas

01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I found in my research is
the possible connection

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.996 align:middle line:84%
between the Sphinx
and the planet Mars.

01:14:16.996 --> 01:14:20.870 align:middle line:90%


01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
In 1976, NASA sent two
Viking spacecraft to Mars

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to photograph the planet and
test for the presence of life.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Two of these photographs
revealed a large human face

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.870 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by a massive
five-sided pyramid.

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Some call the face
the Martian Sphinx.

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:41.550 align:middle line:90%


01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:43.970 align:middle line:10%
These findings were presented
at the United Nations

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:48.330 align:middle line:10%
to an audience of
scientists and journalists.

01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Here's an excerpt from that
presentation by Richard

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
C. Hoagland, science
writer and winner

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Angstrom
Medal for Excellence

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.625 align:middle line:84%
in Science for his research
in the Mars investigation.

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:59.270 align:middle line:90%


01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>>And in 1976, during the
unmanned mission to Mars,

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:07.930 align:middle line:10%
the Viking Mission, lo and
behold, on frame 35872,

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:12.500 align:middle line:10%
taken on an afternoon on Mars of
a northern Martian desert calls

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.990 align:middle line:10%
Cydonia, we, the
human race, NASA,

01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:20.100 align:middle line:10%
the United States of
America, the American people

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:24.280 align:middle line:10%
who paid for the mission,
spotted and noted

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.410 align:middle line:10%
an enigmatic artifact
that did not belong,

01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:31.890 align:middle line:10%
the so-called face on Mars.

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:34.220 align:middle line:10%
Now many things have happened
in the ensuing years,

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.760 align:middle line:10%
but I wanted to show you the
original data to show you

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.830 align:middle line:10%
how far we have come.

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:40.550 align:middle line:10%
Because of course,
the official response

01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:43.450 align:middle line:10%
when this photograph was
first presented to the media

01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:47.050 align:middle line:10%
and to the world was
that it was, in fact,

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:50.200 align:middle line:10%
a trick of light and shadow.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, from that has come an
investigation, some books,

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
some videos, a
lot of discussion.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:15:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And we are here this afternoon.

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a
computer-enhanced version

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
of exactly the same image
done 15, 16 years later.

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Notice the remarkable
level of detail,

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
crossed lines in the forehead,
scalloping on the left side

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
here, the suggestion of teeth
in the mouth, deep set eyes.

01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But again, if we
only had one picture,

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:25.330 align:middle line:84%
we would never know if, as
NASA has said consistently

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
for 16 years, this was merely
the most marvelous trick

01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:32.590 align:middle line:84%
of erosion on the surface
of any planet, or in fact,

01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:34.610 align:middle line:90%
was something else.

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
For that, you require another
set of data, such as this.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
This now a second frame taken
35 days after the first frame.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.954 align:middle line:84%
And Depietro and Molnar,
two imaging engineers

01:16:47.954 --> 01:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
at the Goddard
Space Flight Center

01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
who got into this very
early on in '79 and '80,

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
they were the ones, not NASA
to cull through these 60,000

01:16:57.170 --> 01:17:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Viking images in the archives
and to find this picture,

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and when they processed
it, lo and behold,

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
this object turned out to
be remarkably bilaterally

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.120 align:middle line:90%
symmetric.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And we mean by
that that it seems

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to have a left and a right half.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.360 align:middle line:84%
There appear to be
two eye sockets,

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
the mouth goes through, the
hairline appears to go around.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.520 align:middle line:84%
There's proportion and
symmetry about 95%.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Now facial expressions we see in
mountains or in landscapes here

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
on Earth are inevitably
perspective shots, profiles,

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:34.340 align:middle line:84%
where if you move 100 meters one
way or the other, they go away.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
What made this
different was it was

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
a frontal, full-on,
facial view, as

01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:44.130 align:middle line:84%
if you were looking at yourself
in some kind of cosmic mirror.

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's
a telling metaphor

01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
for exactly what this
was intended to be,

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
if and when we climbed up
the ladder to space flight,

01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
journeyed across space
to Mars, and looked down

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and saw it staring back.

01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.272 align:middle line:90%
Time will tell.

01:17:59.272 --> 01:18:14.430 align:middle line:90%


01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
For the last nine
years, the argument

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
has raged regarding the
reality of this object

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.130 align:middle line:90%
as a constructed artifact.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, our focus has
now begun to shift.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.160 align:middle line:84%
We're looking more at the
meaning of this object,

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.970 align:middle line:84%
including a possible
connection with the Earth.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.140 align:middle line:10%
The key to our apparently
successful solution

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.730 align:middle line:10%
to the riddle of
Cydonia, which is

01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:35.160 align:middle line:10%
the name of the region on
Mars where Viking initially

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.990 align:middle line:10%
photographed the face, turned
out not to be the face at all,

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:42.730 align:middle line:10%
but a two-mile long, half
mile high five-sided pyramid

01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:44.770 align:middle line:10%
located a few miles away.

01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
It was [INAUDIBLE]
Torin, our team member

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
on loan from the defense mapping
agency, who cracked the code.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Because Torin found when
measuring the internal geometry

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of the [INAUDIBLE]
pyramid, that it contains

01:18:56.690 --> 01:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
incredible geometric structure,
fundamental mathematical

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:04.020 align:middle line:84%
constants, which in the
universe are the key

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to signify the presence
of intelligence.

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:10.380 align:middle line:90%
This is the Sphinx.

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
We're now looking
at a structure,

01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
a magnificent, monumental
work of art created at a time

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:21.040 align:middle line:84%
when nobody else on Planet
Earth is supposedly able

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
to do anything of that
magnitude or scale.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
There is no other contemporary
civilization to pin it on.

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:28.910 align:middle line:90%
So who did it?

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And before you say Martians,
just sit there and listen, OK?

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:35.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't want you to leap here.

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Science has now opened, I mean
rigorous science has opened

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.440 align:middle line:84%
the doorway, to what, in I
think it was John's parlance,

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:47.250 align:middle line:90%
the dreaded A word, Atlantis.

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that the
mythos that came down to us

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
through Plato speaking of a
prior high civilization capable

01:19:56.470 --> 01:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
of things like this
is maybe not a myth?

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we're
seeing at least one

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:08.960 align:middle line:84%
surviving, albeit
very ancient artifact,

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that you can touch
of that [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
day when we could do things
that we no longer can do?

01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Something ineffable brushed an
earlier phase of human history

01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and left a monument that
recorded in some form

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.570 align:middle line:90%
the echo of that signal.

01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
The basic model of the Sphinx
is this Lion Man interface.

01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:36.050 align:middle line:84%
We began to look seriously
at the possibility

01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that there was
more than a passing

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.230 align:middle line:84%
connection between
this awesome structure

01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and the monuments of Mars.

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, take a look.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
As you progress through the
various imaging enhancements--

01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
this is the high sun now--
you can very definitely

01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
see that this guy has a
Simian, proto-human look.

01:20:57.890 --> 01:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
What you then do is you
take the halves, all right,

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.165 align:middle line:90%
and you fold over.

01:21:02.165 --> 01:21:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Now let me go back one.

01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You fold over this
half onto that half,

01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually
get a mirror image.

01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's very definitely
a primitive hominid.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not Marilyn
Monroe or Paul Newman.

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is it primitive hominid?

01:21:17.210 --> 01:21:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Might it have something
to do with how old we

01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:24.290 align:middle line:84%
think this thing might be,
circa half a million years?

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Hold that thought.

01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Then what we do is we
go back to the original,

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and we then take the right
half, and we do the same thing.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:37.923 align:middle line:84%
We fold that over,
and we get this.

01:21:37.923 --> 01:21:40.288 align:middle line:90%
[MURMURING]

01:21:40.288 --> 01:21:44.080 align:middle line:90%


01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really gratified
by your response to that.

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
exactly my feeling.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
The hair on the back
of my neck, when

01:21:51.010 --> 01:21:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
what we were looking

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
at in the monument of
Mars, the face on Mars,

01:21:55.810 --> 01:22:01.640 align:middle line:84%
was the fusion of the hominid
and the feline, the fusion

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:10.880 align:middle line:84%
of this persona from this,
I realized that what we were

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:15.250 align:middle line:90%
seeing was, of course, Sphinx.

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Literal embodiments of
Sphinx on two worlds,

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
linked by the fundamental
constance of Cydonia

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.940 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:39.520 align:middle line:90%

ideas are sometimes

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.200 align:middle line:90%
the hardest to overturn.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.130 align:middle line:90%
They seem so obvious.

01:22:45.130 --> 01:22:47.160 align:middle line:90%
The earth is flat.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Man cannot fly.

01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:52.583 align:middle line:90%
Man will never walk on the moon.

01:22:55.350 --> 01:23:00.500 align:middle line:10%
>>For me, though, the idea
of looking back at Earth

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:04.750 align:middle line:10%
from deep space and seeing it
in a new perspective, that's

01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:10.590 align:middle line:10%
the most profound experience
of the entire space program.

>>Dr. Edgar Mitchell,
ex-Navyastronaut,

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
was one of the few men
to walk on the moon.

01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>An example of changing
thought structure

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.260 align:middle line:84%
is the classic one that
begins with Copernicus.

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.340 align:middle line:84%
When Copernicus challenged
the existing notions

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
that all the heavens
moved around the Earth,

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was the
center of creation,

01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't appear from his
observations that was true.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:40.770 align:middle line:10%
And so, he invented or created
the heliocentric theory

01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:44.720 align:middle line:10%
that said all the planets
move around the sun.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was certainly
resisted at the time.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, Copernicus
was a rather wise man.

01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:53.660 align:middle line:84%
He didn't challenge the existing
system till he was near death.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was published after his
death, as a matter of fact.

01:23:56.470 --> 01:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
It was Galileo that came
along with his telescope

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and saw planets moving
around, like moons moving

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, and suggested
that maybe Copernicus was

01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:11.050 align:middle line:84%
right, that Earth was
moving around the sun.

01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:13.300 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, the
authorities of the day

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:16.217 align:middle line:10%
didn't want to even look
through Galileo's telescope.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.800 align:middle line:10%
They were quite confident they
knew the answer without looking

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.003 align:middle line:10%
at new evidence.

01:24:20.003 --> 01:24:23.810 align:middle line:90%


01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:26.680 align:middle line:84%
If geological evidence
and dating evidence

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
suggest that the Sphinx is
much older than we previously

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
believed, it raises
great questions

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
for our concepts of how humanity
evolved over the last 100,000

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:42.900 align:middle line:90%
years.

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
If geological evidence
and dating evidence

01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
suggest that the Sphinx is
much older than we previously

01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
believed, it raises
great questions

01:24:52.630 --> 01:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
for our concept of how humanity
evolved over the last 100,000

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.780 align:middle line:90%
years.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And those are pretty
well-established notions

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:04.930 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:25:04.930 --> 01:25:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So if the Sphinx is
proven to be much older,

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.870 align:middle line:84%
it raises a huge
question mark as to what

01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
sort of sophisticated
civilization

01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
could possibly have existed
to create this monument.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.180 align:middle line:10%
>>There is simply not a
single shred of evidence

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:25.980 align:middle line:10%
that has been presented by any
competent Egyptologist that

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:31.130 align:middle line:10%
suggests that there was any high
culture before the Pre-Dynastic

01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:32.410 align:middle line:10%
Period.

01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Can we have missed it?

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Sure we can have missed it.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.466 align:middle line:84%
I could also grow wings
and fly back home tonight,

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
but I think the probability
of that happening

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.820 align:middle line:84%
is just about as good
as the probability of us

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
having missed the evidence
of such a high culture.

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists, you
have to remember,

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
are not the sort of Indiana
Jones with the bull weapon

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and set the dynamite
charges kind of people

01:25:53.730 --> 01:25:56.290 align:middle line:90%
that the films portray us to be.

01:25:56.290 --> 01:26:00.580 align:middle line:84%
They're very
meticulous workers who

01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
pore over every scrap
of material that

01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:06.730 align:middle line:90%
comes out of the ground.

01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't use
picks and shovels.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.640 align:middle line:84%
They use brushes and
scalpels to scrape

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.270 align:middle line:84%
away, to scrape away the dirt,
and to examine what's there.

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:17.760 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about an
enormous amount of care that

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
is put into the work
that archeologists do,

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and I doubt very much that
the hundreds, the thousands

01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:27.880 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptologists, who've
worked in the Nile Valley

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
since let's say the 1880s,
would have missed even one

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:36.780 align:middle line:84%
little bit of evidence for
such a purported earlier

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.170 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

01:26:38.170 --> 01:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Many archaeologists
and Egyptologists

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.170 align:middle line:84%

If my findings are in
conflict with their theories,

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's time for them to
re-evaluate their theories

01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:54.110 align:middle line:90%
about the rise of civilization.

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that the Sphinx was

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
built by Atlanteans,
or people from Mars,

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.070 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrials.

01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm just following the
science where it leads me,

01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and that leads me to a
conclude that the Sphinx

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.230 align:middle line:84%
was built much earlier
than previously thought.

01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:11.920 align:middle line:90%

>>Schoch and I have a
friendly debate going

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.350 align:middle line:90%
about the age of the Sphinx.

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Schoch holds to his
5,000 to 7,000 BC date

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.710 align:middle line:84%
mainly by taking the most
conservative view allowed

01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:25.580 align:middle line:90%
by the data to hand.

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I think, for a variety of
both intuitive and scholarly

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
reasons, that the data's
is much, much older.

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Schoch isn't even in
disagreement about this,

01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:37.440 align:middle line:84%
but he prefers to take the
most conservative view.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that when and
if our isotopic analysis

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:46.230 align:middle line:84%
in other areas that we're
working in provide a date

01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:48.980 align:middle line:84%
or provide data that we
think is trustworthy,

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that data is going to be
very, very old indeed,

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.941 align:middle line:84%
I think older than 10,000 BC,
really older than 15,000 BC.

01:27:56.941 --> 01:27:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't even surprise
me if the date was a lot older

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.240 align:middle line:90%
than that.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe
that when we get a date,

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.694 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
something so staggering,

01:28:04.694 --> 01:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that nobody's going
to believe the data.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.940 align:middle line:90%


01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>West and his
team have presented

01:28:10.770 --> 01:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
compelling new evidence that
the Sphinx was eroded by rain.

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, does this prove that the
Sphinx and its temple complex

01:28:17.770 --> 01:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
are thousands of years
older than history tells us?

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:24.850 align:middle line:84%
The geology says yes, but
we need more evidence.

01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Recently, scientific
techniques have

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.250 align:middle line:84%
been developed which
could shed new light

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
in the mysterious
cavities under the Sphinx.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.067 align:middle line:84%
West and his team are presently
awaiting the invitation

01:28:35.067 --> 01:28:37.525 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptian government to
continue their investigation.

01:28:37.525 --> 01:28:40.270 align:middle line:90%


01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:44.120 align:middle line:84%
What is it about this legendary
guardian of sanctuaries that

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.620 align:middle line:90%
continues to fascinate mankind?

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:51.360 align:middle line:10%
>>Well the Sphinx one
of the best known images

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.160 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.868 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everybody
knows about the Sphinx.

01:28:53.868 --> 01:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly the
symbol of Egypt.

01:28:56.530 --> 01:29:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a symbol
of mystery and intrigue,

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's something very
magical about the Sphinx.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody
that looks at its image

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.690 align:middle line:84%
feels that mystery
and that magic.

01:29:10.690 --> 01:29:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm a typical scientist slash
engineer, that I love my data,

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I love to play with
my data, and love

01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to see what it's
telling me, and ensuring

01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that what I'm producing is
the best possible product.

01:29:23.710 --> 01:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But now, you take that to
saying that something that I

01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:29.710 align:middle line:84%
did with a
sledgehammer and trying

01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to avoid camels
and horses may have

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
some impact on how the world
looks at its own past history,

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.420 align:middle line:90%
its kind of mind-boggling.

01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, that hasn't
settled with me that much yet.

01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Each branch of
science operates

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.270 align:middle line:84%
within its own
individual paradigm.

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:46.160 align:middle line:90%
We're rocking the boat.

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.930 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at this problem
from a new perspective,

01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're providing some
new and different answers,

01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
answers that perhaps
the establishment is not

01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:55.740 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with.

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.830 align:middle line:84%
We're setting out
to redate history,

01:29:57.830 --> 01:30:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence certainly
points to the fact

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:03.870 align:middle line:84%
that John West's
theory is correct.

01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>An older Sphinx
would drastically

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:09.190 align:middle line:84%
revise our current view
of man's early history.

01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Are we heirs to a richer
legacy than we ever

01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
dreamed of from a civilization,
not of hunter-gatherers,

01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:19.670 align:middle line:84%
but of great artists,
architects, and scientists?

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:22.720 align:middle line:84%
A civilization in command of
technologies we do not yet

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.640 align:middle line:90%
understand and cannot reproduce?

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.227 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there were
Egyptians before the flood.

01:30:28.227 --> 01:30:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Some think they were Atlanteans.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.170 align:middle line:90%


01:30:32.170 --> 01:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But whoever they were, the
Sphinx stands in new testimony

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.380 align:middle line:90%
to their existence.
