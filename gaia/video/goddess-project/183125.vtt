>> I always dreamed
of becoming an artist,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.252 align:middle line:84%
but my parents said it wasn't
a practical career choice.

00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Despite their advice,
from a young age,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I knew this was my
path and was determined

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.848 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever it
took to get there.

00:00:16.848 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
After graduating high
school, I met Sarah.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.124 align:middle line:84%
She was a couple of
years older than me

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:24.624 align:middle line:84%
and had been supporting herself
by working as a video editor

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angelese.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I was inspired by her
passion for making movies,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and we instantly
started collaborating

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:90%
and became best friends.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
In 2010, I won a
scholarship competition

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to go to art school
in San Francisco,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and we moved up there together.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
After living in this city
for a couple of years,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
we are continuously inspired
by the melting pot of women

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:90%
we met everywhere we went.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:84%
As we got to know
each of them, we

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.960 align:middle line:84%
realized how similar our
fears and obstacles were

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and how empowering it is to
hear other women's stories.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.782 align:middle line:84%
At school, I felt frustrated
by the media's representation

00:01:03.782 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
of women and felt like there
was little I could do about it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:90%
by sitting in a classroom.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I decided to leave
school to make

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
art that empowers
women and girls

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and focus on that full time.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.645 align:middle line:84%
It was a big deal for me
to give up my scholarship.

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:20.748 align:middle line:84%
So I called Sarah, and
she met me for lunch.

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:24.519 align:middle line:84%
We talked about all the
amazing women we knew,

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.436 align:middle line:84%
and how many diverse
perspectives were missing

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:28.793 align:middle line:90%
from movies and television.

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We knew there had to
be other people who

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
wanted to hear
stories from women

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of different ages,
backgrounds, and beliefs.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So that day, we decided to
launch a crowdfunding campaign

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to travel the United States
and make a documentary.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:51.074 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really jumping
off of a cliff.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, you gotta jump off
the cliff and step right

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
into your fears.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's no--
there's no in between.

Everybody on this planet
should wish something.

00:02:13.588 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I had to come to the point
where I'd be willing to give up

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
What I discovered is
that anything of value

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really leave.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It may seem so big, or so
impossible, or so daunting,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:90%
or so expensive, or so far.

00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:84%

ways to get what you want.

him and telling him

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
about our project, he said, let
me think about it overnight,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%

such a generous gift.

to tell us that he wanted us

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I've had in my life, just
being this tiny, precious,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
clandestine cargo on
this giant machine that

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:90%
is moving to somewhere.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
A destination that you
don't necessarily know

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
amazing feelings

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that you could ever have.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't do that.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.183 align:middle line:84%
But I did hitchhike
from New York to here.

00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It only took us
three days, and we

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
got dropped off right
at our front door.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.490 align:middle line:90%
That was cool.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's unusual, I
would say, for people,

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and somewhat alarming, to look
at women trusting the world.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
People would be
like, oh, my god.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.677 align:middle line:84%
What are you ladies
doing on here?

00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:27.385 align:middle line:84%
Like, how are you
fending for yourselves?

00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:29.285 align:middle line:90%
>> You traveled alone?

00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:30.085 align:middle line:90%
But how?

00:08:30.085 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Weren't you bored?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Weren't you scared?

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Weren't you lonely?

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh, my god, no.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
You guys make it seem like I
took a rocket ship to Mars.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.147 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is really
not that scary.

00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an interesting being
traveling around the world.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have to trust
yourself, your instinct.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You have to trust your
intuition, your own center.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
trust other people.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And so there's an exchange
that could put you

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:90%
in a vulnerable position.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter where we went,
whether it was a big city

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:84%
or a small suburban
neighborhood,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
there always seemed
to be somebody,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
somewhere who felt compelled
to tell us to be careful out

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> We traveled 10,000 miles.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And we spent almost 200 nights
sleeping in parking lots,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
along mountain tops,
and on city streets.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, the
most notable encounters

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
were love notes left on our
windshield and invitations

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:90%
for home-cooked meals.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.283 align:middle line:84%
>> We learned that people
are inherently good.

00:09:24.283 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you're striving to
make the world a better place,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:84%
someone will always show up to
help you out in a time of need.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> When one of us activate that
knowingness within ourselves

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and we follow the path, that
impulse from our hearts,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
it is irresistible to
other people around us.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And it gives them permission
to also take the leap.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And those who maybe have
an extra bed in their house

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.350 align:middle line:84%
or have a few extra
dollars to spare

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
are so touched by
that activation

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that they yearn to support
us because they're also

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
being gifted with
this permission

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to support themselves
in their path

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:90%
when they're in our presence.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a traditional Navajo
prayer that's "as we walk,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:90%
beauty is on every side.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Beauty is before.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's below us, above us.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
As we walk, the universe
is walking with us.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:90%
As we walk, we walk in beauty."

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what empowerment
is, really is just like being

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:29.202 align:middle line:84%
so solid within yourself that
adventure isn't scary anymore.

00:10:29.202 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that women in
our society hold a lot in.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught that our
emotions are really not OK.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.697 align:middle line:84%
And yet, our emotions
are our guideposts

00:10:45.697 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on in the world.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I always identified myself
as a science-minded person.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that I wasn't
very happy looking at the world

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.605 align:middle line:90%
from a pure state of logic.

00:10:59.605 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And then something
switched on within me.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I dropped into my heart,
and I started just

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:84%
following the impulse of
the heart in my actions.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And time and time
again, magical things

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:84%
started happening that I
couldn't, in a logical way,

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:90%
explain.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
How is it that the
perfect beings are always

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:90%
magnetized into my life?

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
How is it that mathematically
it was impossible to get

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:90%
those bills paid?

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything kind of
just worked out.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So now, after this journey,
what I've discovered is that,

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:84%
actually, what is
most efficient--

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
this is the engineering
me speaking--

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is for all of us to
drop into our hearts

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and allow the brain to just be
a tool in service of the heart.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> As much credit as I get for
using words in effective ways,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they fail me when it
comes to doing things that just

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:90%
feel right.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But I never regretted
that decision

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:90%
I made following my gut.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> If something says,
call this one, do that,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
make sure you bring
an extra battery,

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:84%
make sure you take this car,
make sure you go there first,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff, you
want to listen to it.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can always
analyze something down the road.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you get that
gut feeling about do this

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:90%
or do that, do it.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be happy you did.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to know why.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%
You'll find out why.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What's clear about you guys
showing up right here and now

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is that I just have
been having, like,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:84%
a series of dreams recently that
I come across this mountain top

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:90%
circle of women.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say, welcome.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:90%
We've been waiting for you.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like suddenly I'm accepted
into this group of elder women.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking
to myself, why?

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
What have I done to be
allowed into this circle.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
After an entire
lifetime of thinking

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.923 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed to be
all of these different people

00:13:07.923 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and things, to just come across
these women who just said,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
nothing, you're
just who you are,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're traveling a
path, and you've found us,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and therefore, you are accepted.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.995 align:middle line:84%
So when you guys showed up
here the other night and said,

00:13:20.995 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
we're doing this
goddess project,

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.912 align:middle line:84%
and we want to talk
to you, I'm like,

00:13:23.912 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:90%
why do you want to talk to me?

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I live day to day,
paycheck to paycheck.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.303 align:middle line:84%
I make my art when I
can and love people.

00:13:30.303 --> 00:13:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't see anything
extraordinary about it.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:90%
But that's just the point.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:90%
We're all extraordinary.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
do or be anything.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:90%
We just have to be.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.703 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.703 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout our
cross-country journey,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
we spontaneously met
women everywhere we went.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Each interview was
unique because we

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
asked them to talk about what
they felt most called to share.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Noramay Cadena.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
My family is an immigrant
family from Mexico.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And before me, no one
had ever been to college.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up, we lived
in the house my parents rented.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:90%
It had two bedrooms.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And at one time, there were
10 people living in it.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:90%
I remember living without water.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I remember going without
electricity at times.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.898 align:middle line:84%
So as I was growing up,
my mom said repeatedly,

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:90%
you have to go to school.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to do well
so you're not like me.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
to have this life.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And to really hammer that home,
when I was in middle school,

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I was 13, and she
had me come work

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:84%
in the factory with
her for a summer.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So for a whole summer, I got
to sit for eight hours a day

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and put hooks on the
end of bungee cords.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was a horrible
experience, and I hated it.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things like that
are very hard to forget.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And there were the little
pieces along the way that really

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
fueled a desire in me to give
my parents a different life

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and to enable that
opportunity for other people

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:90%
around my community.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while to forgive
myself for putting myself

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:90%
in that situation.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
As a teen mom, I really
felt like my parents

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
had put so much faith in me,
had sacrificed so much for me.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was
letting them down.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a gentleman who had
graduated from my high school,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and he was an MIT student.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And I go to meet with him.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.655 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you know, I
hear you're good at math

00:15:29.655 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:90%
and you're good at science.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
considered engineering?

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's that?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
At the time when
I had my daughter,

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
he was almost trying to sell
me on the idea of moving

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:90%
3,000 miles across country.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Are you friggin' crazy.?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.106 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I said,
look, I'll apply.

00:15:45.106 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
And I got admitted.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was a little
over one when we packed up

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:90%
and moved away to Boston.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
There were certainly
the people who said,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're
being a bad mother.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:90%
You need to focus on parenting.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But I was trying so
hard to be two people,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to be the great
parent, and to be

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the student I needed
to be to make it

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:90%
to the next level for us.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:84%
It was a big goal
of a better life.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
When you're successful,
it doesn't only help you.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It helps your siblings.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
It helps your parents.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:90%
It helps your children.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
eye-opening experience

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
for so many people
in the neighborhood

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:90%
for the next generation.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When my niece Haviland
was 12 years old,

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.150 align:middle line:84%
she shared her poetry with
me for the first time.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
I told her that it was good.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Then she said, no, it isn't.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:90%
My teachers say I'm too dark.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized in that
moment that Haviland, at 12,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
was already being asked
to fit into a box.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It was so small that her real
voice could never be heard.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
She also said at that
same time that she

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.400 align:middle line:84%
would love to be a
writer when she grew up,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:84%
but she knew a woman couldn't
make a living as a writer.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And so she was going
to be either a teacher

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:90%
or a secretary.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
For Haviland, in
2004, to think those

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
were her only options for
a profession made me nuts.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
thinking about what

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I could do for
Haviland and girls

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
like her to not have any rules
or boundaries around what they

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.480 align:middle line:90%
could be.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
The idea just kind of
like fell out of me.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I woke up one day, and
I was like, oh, they

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.840 align:middle line:84%
need to write about their
lives for a couple of weeks.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:84%
We'll add some dances
and some songs.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And they'll collaborate
with each other

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
to turn it into a
performance piece.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
same time, invite

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
them to meet a whole
bunch of fabulous women

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:84%
who are making a living doing
things that they might not

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
think you can make a living
doing, just to kind of blow

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
their minds with what
their future could hold.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Haviland, my niece for
whom I created the program,

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
just graduated from
college with a double major

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
in astrophysics and philosophy.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's a far cry
from that girl who

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
thought our only options
were teacher and secretary.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
She actually met an
astrophysicist in the circle.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time
that Haviland had realized

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.617 align:middle line:90%
that that was a possibility.

00:18:15.617 --> 00:18:17.325 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're able
to help someone grow,

00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:84%
or find an opportunity,

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
you gain so much
out of it yourself.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Growing other people
is a great reward.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:90%
And we should do more of that.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Through Latinas in
STEM, we're really

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
trying to improve the pipeline
of Latina women into STEM.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:84%
STEM is Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We're all first
generation college grads,

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
so we've been there
from the very beginning

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:90%
of that pipeline.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And we know what it took for us
to even consider this career.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So we want to do what
others have done for us

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and more to really
make a change.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:90%
We have our K to 12 outreach.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And that really focuses on just
putting relevant people out

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:84%
in the community so
that the students feel

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:90%
like, hey, she looks like me.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.418 align:middle line:90%
She grew up like me.

00:19:06.418 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:90%

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
that life-changing, altering
experience that brings them

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%

But if you're not loving
yourself that same way,

to get to a place of feeling
empowered in bodily difference.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.940 align:middle line:84%

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe that a
woman had to be like a man

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.100 align:middle line:90%
to succeed in her career.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.790 align:middle line:90%
I just never believed that.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about trampling
people as you went.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.920 align:middle line:84%
It was more about sort of
you kind of finding your way

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and picking your spots.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt that you
had to be who you were,

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and you had to want it, and
you had to use your intuition

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how you
were going to get there.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I sit here now, and I
look at some of the 20--

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:15.610 align:middle line:84%
or 20-somethings
and 30 somethings,

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and they're the new generation.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.130 align:middle line:90%
There's a new wave.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.332 align:middle line:84%
They're not being brought
into the workforce saying,

00:53:20.332 --> 00:53:21.790 align:middle line:84%
as a woman, the
only way you can be

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:24.890 align:middle line:84%
successful is to wear your
blue suit and red shirt.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:28.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Every day I come to work is
a reminder that we haven't done

00:53:28.265 --> 00:53:29.065 align:middle line:90%
enough.

00:53:29.065 --> 00:53:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I go to too many meetings in
which I'm the only female,

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the only person of
color, the only person

00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:38.030 align:middle line:84%
from an underrepresented
group whatsoever.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't like it because it
really doesn't add value

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to the product we're
building unless we really

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:47.590 align:middle line:84%
have those diverse perspectives
and diverse ways of leading.

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Just last year, I
was at a conference.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
my presentation,

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:56.620 align:middle line:84%
a woman came, and she said,
you actually did a good job.

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I was so impressed.

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And it is a compliment.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.330 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, if I want
to translate it in my mind,

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is, you're better than I thought
because I have this perception

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.820 align:middle line:90%
of people like you.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:15.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't walk into a
presentation with a white male

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and go to him after his
presentation and say,

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect you
to be doing this well.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Actually, you did a good job.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I constantly get those kinds
of comments from people.

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether it's in athletics,
or whether it's in executive

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:36.910 align:middle line:84%
positions in the business world,
or whether it's in artistry,

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is just a
general opinion in society that

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.390 align:middle line:90%
men do it better.

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But just the fact that I have
been a female musical director

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in a largely male-dominated
field speaks volumes.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it unequal?

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it?

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter what industry you
go into, you're going to have

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.515 align:middle line:84%
your insecurities, you're
going to have challenges,

00:55:03.515 --> 00:55:05.598 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have the
people who believe in you

00:55:05.598 --> 00:55:07.060 align:middle line:90%
and the people who don't.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's about you
enjoying the work you do

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and valuing your contribution,
and that gets you ahead.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Muslim--

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Muslim, as you can
see, and believe

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:84%
that women should be respected
for their intelligence

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and their skills, not
for their body image.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And so people put
me in this category

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of being very
religious and holding

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.910 align:middle line:84%
on to traditional
religious values.

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:32.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually not doing that.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk about, for
example, gay, lesbian rights,

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and people go, what?

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:38.360 align:middle line:90%
You are talking about that?

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yes.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.670 align:middle line:84%
You can be thinking differently
in different situations.

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I call myself a Muslim
feminist because I

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:51.570 align:middle line:84%
think Muslim women have been
extremely misunderstood.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:55.895 align:middle line:84%
My spouse is not
religious at all.

00:55:55.895 --> 00:55:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And from the beginning
of our marriage,

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.790 align:middle line:84%
he has said, I
respect your decision,

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.710 align:middle line:84%
how you want to
identify yourself,

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.510 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not
identifying with this.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.930 align:middle line:84%
He says, people think
that I am an oppressor.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in reality,
you are oppressing me.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And so he says,
nobody talks about how

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm oppressed by your
presence in different places.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But we still joke about it,
and he says, one of these days,

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.580 align:middle line:84%
you're going to emancipate
yourself, right?

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, and
one of these days,

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:26.520 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get it, right?

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.090 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That's
why I'm doing this.

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, if I think back, I
was probably always a feminist.

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was
in the eighth grade,

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and I had gone to
Catholic school.

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And the group of girls that
were my friends at the time,

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.580 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about who was
going to be class president.

00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And someone suggested one
of us, and someone else

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:84%
said, oh, no, it
has to be a boy.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.150 align:middle line:84%
It's traditionally--
it's always--

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
thinking, why, why, why?

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.490 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You know, I didn't
like that, but I didn't--

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I
said much about it then.

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:05.420 align:middle line:84%

resistance to really supporting

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.430 align:middle line:90%

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even had a
female president yet.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.250 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy to me.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, I wanted to see a
government that's at least

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.185 align:middle line:90%
half women, at least half.

00:57:17.185 --> 00:57:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So even the movies, and
the industries, and the media,

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:28.940 align:middle line:84%
they don't work on
empowering women.

>> (ON TV) You're
making a mistake.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.710 align:middle line:84%
You would be much happier at
home with a husband and chores.

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:51.770 align:middle line:90%

my first class that taught
what feminist theory was,

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and I asked my mom,
like, are you a feminist?

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And she immediately was
like, no, that's man-hating.

if you can reclaim
that word for yourself,

00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.710 align:middle line:84%

women's empowerment is what
is going to change the world,

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:48.390 align:middle line:84%
that half the population not
being empowered for the greater

history of humanity
is a huge problem.

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.620 align:middle line:84%

those things that

whether you call it God,
Goddess, the Divine,

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.100 align:middle line:84%
this animating life force
is in all of us equally.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
We're made in the image and
likeness of this great source

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.220 align:middle line:90%
energy.

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.262 align:middle line:84%
>> There's all these
different type of religions,

01:00:31.262 --> 01:00:33.577 align:middle line:84%
and they swear they
have different gods,

01:00:33.577 --> 01:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
but I don't necessarily
think it's that way.

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I think that it's the same god.

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They're just practicing
it differently.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.300 align:middle line:90%
They all talk to the same god.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just their
interpretation of that god.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a separation theology
versus oneness theology.

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
When we feel we are separate--
separate from God, like God's

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
out there, that sets up
that kind of judgment.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you shift that
to oneness theology,

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.340 align:middle line:90%
that means that you're God.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm God.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
The trees are God.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.860 align:middle line:90%
The bugs are God.

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything--
everything is sacred.

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If everybody understood
what is divine as part of them

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and not over here, we could
never have had any of the isms

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.470 align:middle line:90%
that took hold.

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, if every
child knew that they

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
were daughter or
son of the goddess,

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and that that was without
them and within them,

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.750 align:middle line:84%
if that was all
part of the picture,

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.955 align:middle line:84%
there'd be no such thing as
someone on the back of any bus.

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:36.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Find the god within yourself.

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:38.197 align:middle line:84%
Don't look outside
yourself for anybody--

01:01:38.197 --> 01:01:39.530 align:middle line:90%

>> --to determine what
your role in this game is.

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.140 align:middle line:90%
It's fully up to you.

call it, there's a force.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you make
that switch in your brain,

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.650 align:middle line:90%
the force works with you.

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Let the force be with
you, quoting "Star Wars."

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You know, as soon
as the switch happens,

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.280 align:middle line:90%
it just all runs smoothly.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.986 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't walk through this life
looking for what you can get.

01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Walk through this life
looking for what you can give.

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I know without a doubt
that what you give

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.170 align:middle line:90%
comes back to you tenfold.

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all together
contributing a huge piece

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.330 align:middle line:90%

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.220 align:middle line:90%
We all have a piece of peace.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When individual parts
reorganize into a larger whole,

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
it's like all these completely
new possibilities and new

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.040 align:middle line:84%
capacities emerge that
weren't there before,

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
but you can't dissect that
and take it apart and find it

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.440 align:middle line:90%
again.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.115 align:middle line:90%
They're not in the individual.

01:02:36.115 --> 01:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
They're in the weaving
of the new connections.

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going
to save us ultimately

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's the synergy that's
going to be created by us

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
coming together with common
intent that are going to bring

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
forth all these amazing
solutions that we can't even

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:54.240 align:middle line:90%
envision individually.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> We grow the power
by sharing the power.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
The goddess energy is
much more about inclusion,

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.703 align:middle line:90%
and it's much more circular.

01:03:02.703 --> 01:03:03.745 align:middle line:90%
There's an understanding.

01:03:03.745 --> 01:03:07.640 align:middle line:84%
You take care of what there
is because you want it to come

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.530 align:middle line:90%
around strong next time.

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:11.860 align:middle line:90%
There is total recycling.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just an ideal
of how things work.

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an inherent
polarity in the universe.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
With yang, it's like the
expressive, the outward,

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
what we typically
think of of masculine.

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And then yin is like that
inward quality, that softness,

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that physical
interior, the darkness,

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
which has always been
represented by the goddess.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:37.663 align:middle line:90%
[SERENE MUSIC]

01:03:37.663 --> 01:03:44.370 align:middle line:90%


01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I have a very
personal relationship

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.360 align:middle line:90%
with the Divine Feminine.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a patriarchal
religion that edited her out

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
in a very subtle way
and decided to tell us

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that she was too sacred to
mention, that praying to her

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
was not allowed, that
connecting with her

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
wasn't allowed because
it would besmirch her.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:11.560 align:middle line:90%


01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, that didn't make
sense to me as a mother.

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know any
mother that feels

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
like connecting with her
own children sullies her.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like
it was a big lie.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It was a way to say,
let's make her invisible.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's make her the
silent partner.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:29.620 align:middle line:90%
God does everything.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm thinking about
our history, like his story.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
His story is the
recorded endeavors

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
of all this yang energy,
and it's what has been seen.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But there's the
invisible history.

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It is the silent
history of all the women

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
who have raised all these
children, all the wives, all

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
the lovers, all the priestesses
who have been there beside,

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
helping and offering
that love and that gift

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
that only the goddess
can give and provide,

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
so committed, and
silent, and humble.

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I had been in service to
returning the Divine Feminine

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to her place of balance,
her place of home,

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
her rightful place
in the family,

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
her rightful place
as an archetype,

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
an image of what we
can grow into as women.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> As I develop my kind
of feminist, or womanist,

01:05:35.550 --> 01:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
principle and started
understanding more about some

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
of the herstories and histories
of the world, you know,

01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
it was important for me to
include in the conversation

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:48.460 align:middle line:84%
the voice of us as women,
as entities in this world.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
People have
different mythologies

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and different origin
myths of whatever culture,

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:57.128 align:middle line:84%
how humanity came to be, but
ultimately, I mean, we all

01:05:57.128 --> 01:05:58.336 align:middle line:90%
come from somebody's coochie.

01:05:58.336 --> 01:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You know what I'm
saying, and that's the given.

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:06.860 align:middle line:84%
There's no mythologies to talk
about male-bodied people giving

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:07.660 align:middle line:90%
birth.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So to me, herstory
makes the most sense.

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not a
biological determinist

01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
but, it's, historically,
we have been the nurturers

01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:17.730 align:middle line:90%
and the keepers of life.

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
A ton of women around
the world know it,

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
so maybe there will
be a critical mass.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
live to see that.

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Magalie Bonneau.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm an artist, a producer,
and a facilitator.

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I bring large groups
of people together

01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:40.410 align:middle line:84%
to share a new
narrative for humanity.

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And I do that by organizing
dance flash mobs, dance

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.970 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies, and also
large-scale ceremonies,

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
turning the Earth as a
canvas and making formations

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.020 align:middle line:90%
that are seen from the sky.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
We brought together
2,000 people.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Half of the
participants were men

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
who were forming a serpent that
were encircling the goddess.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The serpent was conveying
this symbol of transformation

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and of protection,
while the goddess

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
was embodying this sense of
love and healing and nurturing.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
She was incarnated
by 1,200 women.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And she was holding
the sun, who was full

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
of power, the
source of creation,

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
moon, which reflects

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
our fears, our concerns,
the depth of what we

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.600 align:middle line:90%
are beneath our consciousness.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And she was holding
both into balance.

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Honoring the goddess and
making her on a large scale

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is really about reconnecting
what's been disconnected

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and expressing a
message that really

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
reflects the kind of world
we want to give birth to.

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe that there is
a paradigm shift in the world

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.980 align:middle line:90%
that's begun.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has
absolutely upended

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
what's been for a lifetime this
sort of male-dominated energy.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not about a coming
back of matriarchal society

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
because we've had that,
and we've had patriarchal.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's about the
balance of the two

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
because we all, no
matter what sex, we

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:20.800 align:middle line:90%
have those energies in us.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And so to really bring the
feminine back in a way that

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If I say my truth that I
know is being whispered to me,

01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that I'm scared to say, then
there's going to be someone

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
else that I'm going to
be connected to, who,

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.105 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be like, oh my
god, I'm so glad you said that.

01:24:15.105 --> 01:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Too often, we
are embarrassed,

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
or we are fearful
about being vulnerable.

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's only by really
being honest about what's

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
going on inside that
we find our own peace

01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and that we're able to
mysteriously address something

01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that someone else has
been going through.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.613 align:middle line:84%
>> If you just touch one person
for just a little, tiny moment,

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
you know, you don't know how
profound that might have been

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.960 align:middle line:90%
for that person.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We can be forces of
understanding that life is

01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:50.540 align:middle line:84%
complicated, and it's painful,
and it's gut-wrenching,

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's beautiful, and that
each of us comes to this place

01:24:58.210 --> 01:25:00.400 align:middle line:90%
is such a miracle.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that connection
to this raw, unknowable mystery

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:17.710 align:middle line:84%
is a gift that women
bring to this planet.

01:25:17.710 --> 01:25:19.885 align:middle line:84%
>> We kind of owe it to
ourselves and everybody else

01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
to just kind of keep on getting
up every morning and finding

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.040 align:middle line:90%
a reason to do that.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constant seeking
and searching kind of process

01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:28.243 align:middle line:90%
that you wake up.

01:25:28.243 --> 01:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're in
the most desperate mood,

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.868 align:middle line:84%
you still wake up,
and lay there, and go,

01:25:31.868 --> 01:25:35.302 align:middle line:84%
OK, think of one good
reason to get up.

01:25:35.302 --> 01:25:36.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- waffles.

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:38.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if
it's a bad reason.

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if
it's like, I can't

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.200 align:middle line:84%
wait to have that first
cigarette, you know,

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.070 align:middle line:84%
it's still going to
get you up out of bed

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and moving through your life.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you've
got an opportunity

01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference in people's
lives, or at least to just

01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to have a thought
that makes you happy

01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
or have a smile,
to see a rainbow.

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that
sounds cheesy as all hell,

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:00.190 align:middle line:84%
but seriously, it's
still fabulous.

01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so important that,
no matter what you're doing,

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
even when you feel like
you're doing something wrong,

01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:09.325 align:middle line:84%
that you approve of yourself
because if you don't approve

01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, no one
else is going to.

01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone has
their insecurities.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth.

01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:17.370 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:18.510 align:middle line:90%
We all have our faults.

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:19.890 align:middle line:90%
We all have our flaws.

01:26:19.890 --> 01:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've all made
mistakes in our lives,

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
but if we could just pick
ourselves up and just

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
realize that it's evolution
that will never actually end.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:31.871 align:middle line:84%
We are always going
to be growing.

01:26:31.871 --> 01:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, flowers
are not always blooming.

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.670 align:middle line:90%
She loses her leaves.

01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:37.020 align:middle line:90%
She loses her petals.

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.000 align:middle line:90%
She roots more strongly.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.520 align:middle line:90%
She grows the next year.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And her scent never
smells the same.

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.436 align:middle line:84%
So what she's creating,
her essence, her power,

01:26:46.436 --> 01:26:47.920 align:middle line:90%
is always different.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.070 align:middle line:90%
She's always in transformation.

01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>> As women, we need to believe
in ourselves and our abilities

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to contribute more and value
everything we do in terms

01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:00.740 align:middle line:90%
of contributing to society.

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at the
opportunities we have in life,

01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and use the
multi-dimensional thinking

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.900 align:middle line:84%
that women have
in our advantage,

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and change the
society for better.

01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of oppression is
getting people to feel that

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.010 align:middle line:84%
they can't do anything
for themselves.

01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Once we collectively
get over that,

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.560 align:middle line:84%
it will be really
good for us all.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are things
that suck out there.

01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I hate the politics
and the politricks.

01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I want to acknowledge it.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.935 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about it.

01:27:32.935 --> 01:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to wake people up,
and I don't want to sit in it

01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:37.420 align:middle line:90%
and marinate in it.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The key is to find all of
the good stuff and give that

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.050 align:middle line:90%
as much of a presence.

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Those of us that are trying
to be advocates and think about

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
social justice, we
have to be hopeful.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Look at the strengths
instead of weaknesses

01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
because if we want to look
at what's not working,

01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
things not working.

01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
at what's working,

01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:59.970 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
projects and people

01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that are advocating
for differences.

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping we all continue
to be passionate about what

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.560 align:middle line:90%
we believe in.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't help someone who's
sick by being part of the sick.

01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:13.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't help people who
are afraid by becoming

01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:15.580 align:middle line:90%
part of the fearful.

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We can be part of the
solution by not creating

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
a fertile ground for the racism,
and the homophobia, and all

01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
the rest of it to
have much foothold.

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:29.100 align:middle line:90%
That is the job of each person.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.690 align:middle line:84%
If you can at least keep
your spirit up for the day,

01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:33.550 align:middle line:90%
you've done a big thing.

01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It's we as a people rising
to recognize that we have

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
the ability to respond
to everything around us,

01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
starting with ourselves
and moving out from there.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Your life is
really in your hands.

01:28:47.862 --> 01:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what you've
been taught, no matter what

01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
you've been exposed to,
at the end of the day,

01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:54.240 align:middle line:90%
it's you, sister.

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of our road
trip across the United States,

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.960 align:middle line:84%
we shot over 300 hours of
footage and visited 30 states

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
in search of women
from all walks of life.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We lived out of the
Goddess Bus for six months

01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and ran it on recycled
vegetable oil whenever possible.

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The vehicle had a bed,
five drawers, and cabinets

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.340 align:middle line:90%
to hold dry food and equipment.

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Living without amenities in
the hot summer on a budget

01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:30.470 align:middle line:90%
proved to be a challenge.

01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:33.210 align:middle line:84%
We worked out of coffee shops
and the dinner tables of kind

01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:35.780 align:middle line:84%
strangers and learned how
to interview and film women

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.170 align:middle line:90%
as we went.

01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We sat down with artists,
mothers, healers,

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
businesswomen, and
scholars and discussed

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.515 align:middle line:84%
what shaped them to
become who they are today.

01:29:46.515 --> 01:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Although each of their lives
were so different from ours,

01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:51.730 align:middle line:84%
we saw parts of ourselves
in all of these women.

01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Hearing their stories
bridged the gaps

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.390 align:middle line:84%
between our differences
and showed us

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:58.870 align:middle line:84%
how similar many of our
struggles really are.

01:29:58.870 --> 01:30:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Honoring the goddess
is not about what

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
you look like or
do for a living,

01:30:02.710 --> 01:30:05.080 align:middle line:84%
but about celebrating the
experience of womanhood,

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:08.350 align:middle line:84%
finding what brings you joy,
and making a positive impact

01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:10.430 align:middle line:90%
on the world around you.

01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:13.490 align:middle line:84%
We met women who were passionate
about building self-esteem,

01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:17.290 align:middle line:84%
satellites, companies, families,
and everything in between.

01:30:17.290 --> 01:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, we realized
that the true power of women

01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:23.940 align:middle line:84%
is our ability to
create and nurture.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.700 align:middle line:84%
The women in this
film have shown us

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that, with vision,
love, and resilience,

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
we can overcome
obstacles and give birth

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:32.610 align:middle line:90%
to the life of our dreams.

>> Whether it is journeying
down to the depths of your own

01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
shadow and unearthing the light
or giving birth to a creative

01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:42.980 align:middle line:84%
project, the journey you
go through to get there is

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
mirrored in the process of
actual physical childbirth.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Before a child is conceived,
ideally, a woman's body

01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:55.130 align:middle line:84%
is cleansed of any
toxins, and she's

01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:57.920 align:middle line:84%
getting really good
nutrition, and she's

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.350 align:middle line:84%
come to a space
inside of herself

01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:04.310 align:middle line:84%
emotionally where she knows
who she is and feels fulfilled

01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
in her life, so that
when she does take

01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:09.050 align:middle line:84%
on the creation
of this new life,

01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:11.730 align:middle line:90%
she's giving from the overflow.

01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
eliminating any distractions,

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.715 align:middle line:84%
anything that's
diminishing the fullness

01:31:17.715 --> 01:31:19.970 align:middle line:90%
and the power of who we are.

01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's allowing yourself
the space to have a dream,

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:27.620 align:middle line:84%
have a vision, find
your inspiration.

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:32.930 align:middle line:84%
