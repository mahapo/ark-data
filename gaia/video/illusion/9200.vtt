00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:31.871 align:middle line:84%
let's look at the balcony.
Shakespeare

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.909 align:middle line:90%
was very smart. There is

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.146 align:middle line:84%
a space between them. If it's
difficult

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:44.384 align:middle line:84%
for them to touch, romance is
found

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:48.588 align:middle line:90%

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:52.592 align:middle line:90%

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:09.275 align:middle line:84%

I want

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:12.481 align:middle line:84%
him to know that I was the one
that was not good, not

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.617 align:middle line:84%
him. >> Stan: Don't say that,
Mister Baines, you're just -

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Baines: Listen, he's
suffered and I lived

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:20.922 align:middle line:84%
like a king in a mansion making
movies.

01:09:20.922 --> 01:09:25.061 align:middle line:90%
I was alone,

01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:29.165 align:middle line:90%
always alone, never married,

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:33.168 align:middle line:90%
because I never loved.

01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:37.473 align:middle line:90%
I lived like a coward, but

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:41.711 align:middle line:84%
my son, he's not a coward.
Please

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.813 align:middle line:84%
let me meet him. >> Stan:
Mister Baines, I can't do that.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.915 align:middle line:90%
That's not my

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.983 align:middle line:84%
job. >> Baines: Just tell me
where he is then.

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:50.052 align:middle line:84%
Is he in jail? >> Stan: No, no,
he's not

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:52.121 align:middle line:84%
in jail. >> Baines: Is he
married? Does he have children?

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan: No, Mister Baines, I
can only

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
show you. >> Baines: God damn
it, give me something!

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:14.877 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Stan.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:18.948 align:middle line:90%
Did he

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:23.285 align:middle line:90%
ever see that girl again?

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:27.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Stan: Yeah, he

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:31.761 align:middle line:90%
does. You want to see that reel?

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:35.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Baines: Is it recent?

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:40.069 align:middle line:84%
Will I be able to figure out
where he is?

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan: It may help you. Why
don't you watch it?

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Baines: Yes, I

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:52.448 align:middle line:90%
will watch it. Vladimir! Hey!

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:56.452 align:middle line:90%
Turn that projector back

01:10:56.452 --> 01:11:00.623 align:middle line:90%

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:04.693 align:middle line:90%

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:44.787 align:middle line:84%

Isabelle, oh I remember
Isabelle.

She's a real pretty gal. >>
Christopher: Yeah,

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.162 align:middle line:84%
she was. >> Woman: But she
moved out a while back.

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:55.197 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember when.

She was

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:03.605 align:middle line:78%
private about things like, you
know, most everything. Oh, wait
a

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:07.876 align:middle line:84%

some of her old mail still,

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:10.012 align:middle line:78%

could take a look

why not. Come on over.

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:20.489 align:middle line:84%
I got all sorts of stuff in
here my

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
boarders have left behind. One
lady, she left her

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.597 align:middle line:84%
false teeth. I found them in
the bathroom,

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:32.901 align:middle line:78%
sitting right there on the edge
of the tub. Look at that,
believe it?

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:37.172 align:middle line:84%
Okay, here we are. All this
stuff came after she

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:41.377 align:middle line:78%
left, you know, but you can't
throw mail away. It's against
the law.

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:43.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Christopher: Yeah. >> Woman:
Now most of this is junk mail,

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:45.514 align:middle line:84%
but there's some letters in
here that look important. There,

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:49.618 align:middle line:84%
there's one right there. Yeah.
And here's

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:53.622 align:middle line:78%
another one. You know, why
don't we peek in them and maybe
we can

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:55.758 align:middle line:78%
find out where she went? I can
put the teapot on, we steam
them open.

01:14:55.758 --> 01:14:57.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Christopher: Nah, I don't
think that'll help.

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:02.164 align:middle line:78%
>> Woman: We'll seal them right
back up. She won't know the
difference.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:06.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Christopher: No, these are
all from me. I wrote them.

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:10.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Woman: Oh, I see. I sure wish

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:14.543 align:middle line:78%
I could tell you where she
went, but I just don't know.
You might try asking

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:18.914 align:middle line:84%
around town. Oh, you know,
there was a little

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:22.918 align:middle line:84%
cafe that she just loved. It
was downtown

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:26.922 align:middle line:78%
somewhere. You could ask there.
>> Christopher: Do you think I
could keep these?

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:31.060 align:middle line:78%
>> Woman: Well, they're yours
so I suppose so. >>
