00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> What's happening
in Mexico's skies?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that in
the last 15 years,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.370 align:middle line:84%
unidentified flying objects
have flown through the skies

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:84%
with a frequency that seems
to be steadily increasing?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
The number of witnesses
is multiplying, too,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and thanks to technology, so
is the number of amateur films.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
The media have documented
these incredible episodes,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and many people
are now wondering

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in Mexico.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
The most organized
of them are a group

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
of researchers who have begun
an unprecedented project

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
modern ufology,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
systematically studying
and monitoring the sky.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything is filmed, recorded,
and scientifically documented.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The team's name
is the Vigilantes,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and their work has produced
an incredible number

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
of photographs,
testimonies, and films

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.864 align:middle line:84%
which are analyzed
very carefully.

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
The amount of material
is so impressive

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that it led the researchers
to think of Mexico

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:90%
as a true contact point.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
It all began with a
total solar eclipse

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that took place in Mexico
on the 11th of July, 1991,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
coinciding with an
ancient Mayan prophecy.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The prophecy foretold that
such an eclipse in Mexico

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
would mark the beginning
of humanity's encounter

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:90%
with the Lords of the Stars.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
It was all written in
the Dresden Codex, one

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of the few documents
that escaped the wrath

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:90%
of the Spanish Conquistadors.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:10%
But let's get back
to the eclipse.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
On the 11th of July, 1991,
millions of people and hundreds

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:84%
of video cameras followed this
spectacular astronomical event.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Initially nobody
seemed to notice

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
the presence of an
anomalous aircraft hovering

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:90%
in the sky over Mexico City.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But when reviewing
the footage later,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:84%
many people noted
at the intruder.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be made of metal
that reflected the sunlight,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was shaped like
a classic flying saucer.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
The sighting created
quite a stir,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and even the TV media
became involved,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
especially researcher and
journalist Jaime Maussan.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
In the days following the
eclipse, the staff of Televisa,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:84%
one of Mexico's largest
private TV networks,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
was flooded with videos of
the mysterious aircraft.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%
The public's curiosity grew.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:10%
What exactly was the object
filmed during the eclipse?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:10%
Where did it come from?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:10%
Could it possibly
be a confirmation

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.925 align:middle line:10%
of the mysterious
Mayan prophecy?

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Demetrio Feria, one of the
first members of the Vigilantes,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:90%
remembers that day well.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:10%
>> My experience began in
June of 1991 before the great

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:10%
eclipse that took place in
Mexico on the 11th of July

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:10%
of that year.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
That was when I
decided to film them.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I already had a
video camera and I

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know whether
the phenomenon was

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
real or just a bunch of lies,
special effects or something

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And luckily I managed
to capture them on film.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I devoted quite a bit of time to
them between June and November,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and I began filming them
one dawn in November

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:90%
5:00 in the morning.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Ruben Villatoro also
remembers eclipse well.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
That was the moment he
decided to become a vigilante.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:10%
>> After the total solar eclipse
on the 11th of July, 1991,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:10%
Jaime Maussan went on television
and said that at the time

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.309 align:middle line:10%
of the eclipse, there were
people who had filmed the UFOs

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:10%
with their video cameras.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I decided that it was important
to follow their example.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I bought a video camera,
and over the years

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I've filmed several objects
flying over Mexico City.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The event during the
eclipse seemed to have opened

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:84%
a Pandora's box
of UFO sightings.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Thus Mexico saw the
beginning of one

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
of the most intense waves
of sightings in history.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Without a doubt, the
remarkable availability

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
of cameras and video cameras
improved the potential

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.557 align:middle line:90%
for sightings.

00:05:18.557 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But the number of
sightings only began

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
to grow exponentially
after the eclipse

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:90%
of the 11th of July, 1991.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Footage from Mexico
traveled around the world,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
amazing those who saw the
videos and bringing much joy

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
to scholars who had never had
so much material to analyze.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Of all the investigators, Jaime
Maussan is the most responsible

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
for having researched
and disseminated

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
the large quantity of video
footage captured in Mexico

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
by those occasional witnesses
and by the Vigilantes.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The idea to start this
group was also his.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:10%
>> The Vigilantes
group was Jaime's idea.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
He was the one to
form the group.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.966 align:middle line:84%
And when I arrived, it
was already in existence.

00:06:16.966 --> 00:06:23.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:90%
The group still exists.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Its members are few, but
those who have stayed

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
are at the forefront
of this research.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Today Jaime Maussan
directs and coordinates

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
the Vigilantes' work alongside
researcher Pedro Avila.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:84%
His videos of unidentified
flying objects

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
have circulated
around the world,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
generating a great
deal of interest.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
For over 15 years,
Pedro has lived

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
the life of a near
recluse in his small room

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:84%
to a debilitating illness
that has practically

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:90%
immobilized him.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Despite this, Pedro Avila
has made some very important

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
contributions to international
ufological research

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:90%
from within his small world.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
A small window
and a piece of sky

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:84%
are his only contact with
the outside world, which

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
he observes carefully from
the first hours of the day

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:90%
well into the night.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:10%
He's a full time Vigilante, and
without a shadow of a doubt,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:10%
he's one of the best.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people ask me, or
wonder why most of my videos

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:10%
were filmed from
this little window.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, there are two reasons.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I have a little
window no more than 1.8 meters

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
in length and one
meter in height,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and my visual angle
is quite limited.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Therefore it's a
bit difficult for me

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:84%
to make out these objects,
and in this little space,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I've managed to record
everything that I've

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:90%
filmed to the present.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The second reason is
that some time ago, I

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with
an illness known

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:84%
as progressive muscular
dystrophy, which obviously

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:90%
gets worse with time.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And now I can't leave the
house like I used to be.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:10%
In the past I used
to film these videos

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:10%
from the garden or the garage.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But when my health
grew delicate,

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I was forced to stay in my room.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I imagined I thought that this
would limit my ability to film

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
videos since I didn't have
the same extent of sky

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that I could see
from the garden.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
However, I was greatly surprised
because I realized that

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
from here, from
this little window,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I've recorded the best
videos I've ever shot.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Pedro is a true example
of extraordinary passion

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:90%
and willpower.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Armed with his camera, video
camera, and binoculars,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
he has captured some of the best
footage of unidentified flying

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.165 align:middle line:90%
objects ever filmed.

00:09:21.165 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.506 align:middle line:84%
His collection includes
some light spheres

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:90%
and the famous flotillas.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:40.910 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
videos of spheres

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:90%
was recorded in Mexico in 2002.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The images clearly showed two
spheres revolving in the sky.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Ordinarily the spheres
appear to be shiny and white.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
But in this film, the
spheres' metal form

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:90%
is clearer than ever before.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:10%
This footage confirms statements
made by many other witnesses

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:10%
who claim to have seen similar
spheres fly through the sky

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly change state,
going from luminous to metallic.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
flotillas and spheres,

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Pedro has also filmed
some unconventional

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
flying objects of a totally
unexplained appearance.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I once filmed six dark
objects that looked like

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:10%
watermelons seeds, like
little black seeds.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:84%
These six objects formed a
shape in the sky very much

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:90%
like a flower with six petals.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.036 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.036 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The strange thing is
that when we zoom in,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
when we analyze
the video, when we

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
add filters and all the rest, we
can't seem to find a structure.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the objects
are moving rhythmically

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
with an amazing
synchronicity, and always

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
keeping the same position as
if they were a flower spinning,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
going up and down but always
keeping the same distance

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.205 align:middle line:84%
despite there being no
structure between the objects.

00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Avila's video is the first to
show an object of such a shape

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:90%
flying in broad daylight.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Pedro Avila has filmed
objects demonstrating

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
incredible abilities that have
never before been documented.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:10%
Thanks to his commitment and
an original filming technique,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:10%
he has produced
results showing that

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:10%
the mysterious
unidentified flying

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:10%
objects may have features
we don't yet know about,

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.285 align:middle line:10%
which are of
extraordinary interest.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the videos I consider
the most important involves

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:10%
objects that are invisible to
the naked eye and which can

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:10%
only be captured by
using infrared vision.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:10%
To do this, I developed
a special technique

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:10%
using two video cameras.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:10%
One films in the usual
spectrum and the other films

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:10%
in the infrared spectrum.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:10%
To use them both, I made a
special rigging and placed one

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:10%
camera atop the
other, training them

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.425 align:middle line:10%
on the same point, that is,
the same focal distance,

00:12:42.425 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:10%
the same level of zoom.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:10%
I framed the images so that
they show the exact same things.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Therefore what the
normal camera sees

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
is also what the
infrared camera sees.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
This is very important
because it demonstrates

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:84%
that there are objects
moving in the sky that

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
are invisible to the
human eye, and we

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:90%
can't perceive their presence.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:10%
>> The large number of videos
that the Vigilantes have

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:10%
recorded shows that craft are
flying through our skies with

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:10%
characteristics and flight
dynamics that differ from

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:10%
conventional features of
airplanes or helicopters.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's not all.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:84%
These videos demonstrate that
systematic and continuous

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
observation of the
sky can provide

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
interesting documentation
quite different

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
from accidental amateur footage,
which tends to raise doubts.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It's no coincidence
that the Vigilantes

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.812 align:middle line:84%
have respectable
professional backgrounds.

00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that
drove me to become a Vigilante

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:10%
of the sky was my work as
a professional architecture

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.315 align:middle line:10%
photographer.

00:13:56.315 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:84%
In particular,
what was important

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
was that it led me to
take good pictures.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And as a professional
photographer,

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
my knowledge of light and
shadow makes a difference.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
factor to be

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:84%
able to see the object
knowing what time of day

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
the light helps us, when
the sun literally brings out

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:90%
the objects.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Spheres and flotillas also
make frequent appearances

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
in the videos by
Arturo Robles Gil,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
and they are truly spectacular.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Where could these mysterious
objects have come from?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe
they have captured

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:90%
the answer in a photograph.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
During the great wave of
sightings in the 1990s,

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
phenomena were cited that
amazed both direct witnesses

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.293 align:middle line:90%
and researchers.

00:14:55.293 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Video cameras captured
flying objects

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
capable of releasing an
incredible number of spheres,

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.322 align:middle line:84%
given rise to the
flotilla a phenomenon.

00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
At first, the classic
luminous spherical objects

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.335 align:middle line:84%
were the ones to
show this trait.

00:15:16.335 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Later, but still in Mexico,
enormous tubular structures

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:90%
were cited and filmed.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:10%
Further light spheres came out
of these irregularly shaped

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:10%
structures.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:10%
This new chapter
added new questions

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:10%
and mysterious elements
to the world of ufology.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:10%


00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:10%
Even ufology experts can't
explain these images.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:10%
The objects are christened
gusanos voladores

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.415 align:middle line:10%
or flying worms, because
of their appearance.

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:10%


00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:10%
They raised many questions.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:10%
Where do they come from?

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:10%
What technology do they use?

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:10%
How can these structures
appear that hover in the sky

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.091 align:middle line:10%
without any known
flight mechanism?

00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:10%


00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.884 align:middle line:10%
How can they contain and
expel the number of spheres

00:16:09.884 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:10%
that are being filmed?

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:10%


00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:10%
A major step has
been taken, thanks,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:10%
once again, to one
of the Vigilantes,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:10%
engineer Arturo Robles Gil.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> That morning I went
out onto the terrace,

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:84%
although it was very cloudy,
to check the weather conditions

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
because that night there was
going to be a lunar eclipse,

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
which is very important from
a photographic point of view.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
At the time, in 2004, there
were a number of people

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
here repairing the building,
and we all witnessed it.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But I was the only one who
looked up to the zenith.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know why
I did it, as I usually

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
made general
observations all around.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:10%
But on that day,
I remember that I

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:10%
turned my head completely
upward and I saw

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:10%
an object I couldn't identify.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:10%
I saw a structure.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.475 align:middle line:10%
At first sight it looked like
a mass, white and enormous.

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:10%
To give you an idea of how
large it, was like two jets

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:10%
put together.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
At the time I was
already interested

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in phenomena
discovered in the sky.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I had my video camera
and tripod in hand,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.014 align:middle line:90%
and I began to film the object.

00:17:54.014 --> 00:17:58.487 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:58.487 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:10%
Moving closer with
my video camera,

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:10%
I realized that the
structure was moving,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:10%
that it wasn't simply floating.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:10%
It was twisting, writhing.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:10%
It contracted and expanded.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:10%
And when I saw that it was
beginning to expel spheres,

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:10%
it was clear to me that
something absolutely incredible

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.142 align:middle line:10%
was happening.

00:18:36.142 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So I asked myself,
what else can I do?

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I thought that photographs could
be a tremendously important

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:90%
support, and so I took some.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I remember that I took
about 24 photographs.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The high definition
images that Gil obtained mark

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
an important breakthrough in
the study of these spectacular

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:90%
unidentified structures.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:10%
>> When I downloaded the
photos to my computer,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:10%
I realized that the structure
appeared to be formed

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.345 align:middle line:10%
by thousands, or hundreds
of thousands, of segments.

00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
It also had colored
outer spheres.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.967 align:middle line:84%
I'll be honest,
at first I thought

00:19:30.967 --> 00:19:32.800 align:middle line:84%
it might be a spectacular
bunch of balloons.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I talked about it
with Jaime Maussan.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I went to his
office, and as soon

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:84%
as he saw what I had filmed,
without having the slightest

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
idea what it was,
he said, Arturo,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:84%
what you've captured here
is absolutely spectacular.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
There were those
who were skeptical,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.155 align:middle line:84%
whose unfounded argument was
that they could be balloons.

00:19:59.155 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So Jaime Maussan immediately
phoned a very well-known

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:84%
performer here in Mexico
City who uses the largest

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:90%
balloons in production.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.310 align:middle line:84%
When he arrived at the
office and saw the images,

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.800 align:middle line:90%
he said, these aren't balloons.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And even if they were
balloons, a structure like this

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
would require at least 57,000
balloons, possibly more.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
How could you possibly create a
structure with 57,000 balloons

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.249 align:middle line:90%
without any gas escapes?

00:20:42.249 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And how could you
let it fly upwards?

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, you'd
need a special permit

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
because a structure of
that size needs a permit

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:84%
to fly, especially because
in that particular area,

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:84%
it was very close to flight
paths used by airplanes to turn

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:90%
into the airport.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:90%
To me, that was a breakthrough.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The Mother Ebani, as I
call it, the mother ship.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The acronym EBANI stands in
Spanish for unidentified aerial

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:90%
biological entity.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And since Gil photographed
them in high definition,

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
sightings of EBANIs have
been increasingly frequent.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The movements of these
objects seems to be organic.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They remind us of
a living being.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:10%
Maybe this is how they
maintain stability in the sky.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:10%
We call them Unidentified Aerial
Biological Entities or EBANI.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:10%
And this biological aspect
is the most important thing.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:10%
They appear to be alive.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if they are not.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:10%
But that's the sense you get
when you see them on film.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:10%
We do know that when
we see an EBANI,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:10%
we see spheres
afterwards, which may show

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.410 align:middle line:10%
that there's some connection.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:10%
>> These features become even
more evident to the videos made

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:10%
by Arturo Robles Gil since then.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:10%


00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:10%
The forms and behavior of
these anomalous entities

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:10%
seem to be writing the most
incredible chapter in the study

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.435 align:middle line:10%
of unidentified flying objects.

00:23:07.435 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:10%
>> An EBANI is a tubular-type
entity that is also elastic.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:10%
It is capable of twisting
and writhing movements.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:10%
It can move vertically
and horizontally.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't need engines to fly.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.210 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't make any noise.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't leave a wake.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
The EBANIs appear to have a
specific activity expelling

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
countless spheres
into the atmosphere.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
On some occasions,
they have moved

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:84%
from the place where they
ordinarily appear and come

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:90%
towards this area.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It's as if they
wanted to be seen,

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.916 align:middle line:84%
to be observed with
greater precision.

00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to my work
as a photographer,

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
this has enabled
me to create videos

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that I believe are
without precedent, even

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:90%
on an international level.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:10%
>> The videos made by the
Vigilantes are just a small

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:10%
part of the large amount of
footage showing the continuous

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:10%
activity of unidentified
flying objects in the skies

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:10%
of our planet.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:10%
The two most common
questions are always the same

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:10%
no matter where the
phenomena are cited.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:84%
What are those
objects in the sky?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:90%
And should we be afraid of them?

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Giorgio Bongiovanni is one of
the Italian scholars following

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.615 align:middle line:84%
the wave of sightings
in Mexico very closely.

00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>> The claims of ordinary
citizens, military personnel,

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:10%
astronauts, and scientists,
and the analyses performed

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:10%
on a remarkable amount
of photographic and video

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:10%
materials, including the
testimony of contactees whose

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:10%
experience has been proven to
be real after several years,

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:10%
they all show that it's likely
we're being visited by beings

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:10%
from space.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:10%
They have passive and
aggressive visits,

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:10%
more concentrated
in Latin America

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:10%
and in Mexico than in
other parts of the world.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But they occur all
over the planet.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
This is happening in a
period in which humanity

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
is going through a difficult
moment in its evolution.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if
clear direct, contact

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:84%
were to occur with
these civilizations,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.130 align:middle line:84%
it would lead to a truly
profound Copernican revolution

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that humanity could
solve the serious problems

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
in terms of social,
political, economic,

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and environmental justice
which are causing us

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to risk self-destruction.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It would definitely
be a new impulse

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:90%
for science and religion.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
It would bring about
the end of the dogmatism

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and dangerous fanaticism at the
basis of many of today's wars.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I can only hope that this event
will occur as soon as possible.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, over many
years of sightings,

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the UFO phenomenon has never
been accompanied by any signs

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:90%
of aggression.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:90%
One thing is certain.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Mexico seems to play a
central role in this saga that

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:90%
borders on science fiction.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
is still a mystery.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the only clue is
an ancient Mayan prophecy

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that tells of an encounter
with the Men of the Stars,

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:84%
an encounter that would
have begun in 1991

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:90%
and may end in the year 2012.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:10%
The appearance of unidentified
aerial biological entities,

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:10%
or EBANI, is one of the most
surprising breakthroughs

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.165 align:middle line:10%
in the history of
unidentified flying objects.

00:27:20.165 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:10%


00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:10%
The term EBANI stands for
Unidentified Aerial Biological

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:10%
Entity in Spanish, and it was
coined by Mexican researcher

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.490 align:middle line:10%
and journalist Jaime Maussan.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
One of these entities was
captured in a video and photos

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.620 align:middle line:84%
by Arturo Arturo Robles
Gil on the morning

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:90%
of the 27th of October, 2004.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:10%
In Gil's opinion,
this particular entity

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:10%
constitutes a true
breakthrough in UFO apparitions

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:10%
and a new, enigmatic
puzzle for scholars.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:10%
Until that fateful
morning, very little

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:10%
was known about
these structures,

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:10%
in part due to the rarity
of available videos

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:10%
and the fact that the images
didn't have enough definition

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.276 align:middle line:10%
to be interpreted.

00:28:10.276 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The video, and in particular,
the extraordinary photos

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that Arturo Robles Gil
managed to take home

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the 22nd of October,
2004 clearly show

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that the EBANI is a
structure formed by thousands

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
of clustered spheres, a sort of
aircraft carrier, the function

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:84%
of which seems to be
to transport and expel

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:84%
these spheres into
our atmosphere.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:10%
The reason why this should
happen is completely unknown.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a phenomenon that's
difficult to catalog

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.515 align:middle line:84%
and explain, even for
mainstream science.

00:29:00.515 --> 00:29:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:10%
because

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Scientists have only been
able to provide one answer

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:10%
so far.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at an
anomalous phenomenon

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.915 align:middle line:84%
that is classified in neither
micro nor macro biology.

00:29:18.915 --> 00:29:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>> From an observation of
the photos taken by Gil,

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
we can clearly see the structure
is formed of translucent

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
spheres in three different
colors, red, white, and blue.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:10%
Until that moment,
only one video

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:10%
had shown a transparent
sphere in flight.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It, too, had been
recorded in Mexico

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:90%
by Javier Guevara in 2002.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.662 align:middle line:84%
At the time, however, the origin
of this new kind of sphere

00:29:56.662 --> 00:29:57.646 align:middle line:90%
was unknown.

00:29:57.646 --> 00:30:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The sphere's
trajectory is linear

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and its speed is
fairly sustained,

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:84%
indicating that it has
its own propulsion system.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of the system
that enables such an object

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.190 align:middle line:90%
to fly remains a mystery.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Its transparency and the lack
of any visible technological

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:84%
apparatus cannot be compared
to any known or imaginable

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.320 align:middle line:84%
After the video of the
27th of October, 2004,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Gil identified and recorded the
flight of other similar spheres

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:90%
on film and in photographs.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.140 align:middle line:84%
This transparent
sphere was photographed

00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:04.280 align:middle line:90%
at low altitude in 2005.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Gil recorded this
video while he attended

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:84%
a Mayan ceremony in the
area called Cerro de la

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Estrella, or Star Mountain.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.090 align:middle line:84%
This site, in the federal
district of the City of Mexico,

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:84%
is believed to be
magical and sacred,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and many UFOs have
been sighted here.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as we arrived, my
sister-in-law noticed a large

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
translucent object,
and I began to film it.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:84%
We were all quite surprised that
it could happen in that place.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But Gil came upon his
most spectacular scoop

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:90%
on the 28th of January, 2005.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.870 align:middle line:84%
His video shows an
entire flotilla composed

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.980 align:middle line:90%
of these iridescent spheres.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:84%
The spheres dance elegantly in
the sky, quite unlike anything

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.468 align:middle line:84%
that had been filmed
up to that time.

00:32:14.468 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.560 align:middle line:84%
In the pictures, we can
clearly see the various colors

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%
of the shining spheres.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The colors are even
clearer than in the video.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.570 align:middle line:84%
The images clearly
show the same kind

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.360 align:middle line:84%
of spheres that made up
the EBANI photographed

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:90%
on the 27th of October, 2004.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Thus, according
to Gil, this video

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:84%
may confirm that the mysterious
aerial biological entities

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:84%
would continue to
deposit spheres

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.990 align:middle line:90%
into the skies over Mexico City.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But the phenomenon has further
surprises in store for us.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:10%
>> After the enormous
entity was cited in 2004,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.267 align:middle line:10%
others began to appear.

00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:10%
But they weren't the same.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:10%
They didn't look
like the first one

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:10%
although they showed the
same type of behavior

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.900 align:middle line:10%
during the flight.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:10%
Once I had sighted
these entities,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:10%
I began to realize that
they weren't just white

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:10%
and there wasn't just
one type of EBANI,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:10%
but other types of
different colors,

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:10%
with different designs
on their surface,

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:10%
and with a different
way of moving.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The photos taken by Arturo
Robles Gil on the 14th of May,

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:20.300 align:middle line:84%
2006 are a clear example
of the variety of EBANIs.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.610 align:middle line:84%
These EBANI are brightly
colored and have

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.830 align:middle line:84%
a helical, tubular
structure which

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.150 align:middle line:84%
is completely different
from the cluster of spheres

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:33.440 align:middle line:90%
spotted in October, 2004.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So why helical?

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.270 align:middle line:10%
Because a helical structure
with the same diameter

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.820 align:middle line:10%
obviously has a larger
storage capacity

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:10%
for the spheres inside it.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.489 align:middle line:84%
It can contain hundreds of
spheres, which they then

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:50.780 align:middle line:90%
expel into our atmosphere.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When looking at this
new photographic material,

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.349 align:middle line:84%
many skeptics think that these
are only colorful balloons.

00:34:56.349 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I can understand the
skepticism about the colored

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.700 align:middle line:84%
EBANI, the people who think
that they are structures made

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:90%
of balloons.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Luckily I'm never
satisfied with just using

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:90%
video cameras to film them.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Seen in technical
terms, video cameras

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
have a resolution of 640
by 780 pixels, and at best,

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.965 align:middle line:84%
will get a resolution
of 520 lines.

00:35:43.965 --> 00:35:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why I also
take photographs.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Photos go deeper because they
allow us to see more detail.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.607 align:middle line:84%
And photos have demonstrated
in an unequivocal way

00:36:03.607 --> 00:36:05.565 align:middle line:84%
that these are not
structures made of balloons.

00:36:05.565 --> 00:36:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics have tried to
discredit this phenomena,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:84%
but their claim that these
are garlands of balloons

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.330 align:middle line:90%
is completely unfounded.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a single
high resolution photograph.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't have photos
taken with high sensitivity

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.830 align:middle line:90%
apochromatic lenses.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Their claims are based solely on
the color of these structures.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:10%
>> But Robles Gil isn't the only
one to have filled the EBANI.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:10%
The phenomenon began to
spread, and these entities

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.746 align:middle line:10%
were sighted and
filmed by others, too,

00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:49.820 align:middle line:10%
both in Mexico and in
other parts of the world.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:37:04.990 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.510 align:middle line:84%
This black EBANI, filmed in
the skies over Los Angeles,

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.620 align:middle line:90%
is of remarkable interest.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:15.140 align:middle line:84%
On one of its ends we can
clearly see a blinking light.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.260 align:middle line:84%
The mystery surrounding
that true nature

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.820 align:middle line:84%
thus gains a new element
which has been unknown

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:90%
up to this time.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Once again, Gil amazes
us with his material.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:84%
On the 18th of March, 2007,
he recorded in new video

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and experienced an
unprecedented event.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.710 align:middle line:84%
In his video, we get
a real impression

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that the EBANI is
a live creature.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> On the 18th of March, an
EBANI was moving towards us,

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:90%
flying low.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I filmed the object
passing over my head.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I was able to film it
with truly amazing detail.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
This terrace has two levels,
and we're on the lower part.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I climbed to the
top part because it

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:32.190 align:middle line:84%
was going towards the
Jalisco area, southwards.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And by then I was satisfied with
the close-up images I had got.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:43.620 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So I went up without
my video camera,

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and I realize now
that it was a mistake

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:90%
not to have brought it with me.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Once the EBANI arrived, making
its usual twisting movements,

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.810 align:middle line:84%
it suddenly stopped,
straightened itself,

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and flew off at an astonishing
speed towards the Santa Fe

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.660 align:middle line:84%
area, arriving there
in just a few seconds.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:84%
From that moment,
it was clear to me

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that this wasn't just
some kind of flying snake,

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:84%
but a real aircraft capable
of traveling and moving

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.900 align:middle line:84%
at incredible
speeds, much faster

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.955 align:middle line:84%
than any commercial
or military aircraft.

00:39:28.955 --> 00:39:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Arturo Robles Gil's story seems
to confirm that the EBANIs

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:41.000 align:middle line:84%
cannot be a mass formed
of mere balloons.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:84%
The images show autonomous
flight mechanism,

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.450 align:middle line:84%
an unexplainable
propulsion system,

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:84%
as unexplainable as the
system that expels its spheres

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.192 align:middle line:90%
into the atmosphere.

00:39:52.192 --> 00:40:05.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.210 align:middle line:10%
In the video of the
1st of July, 2007,

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:10%
too, we get a remarkable
sense of the biological nature

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:10%
of the EBANIs.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.140 align:middle line:10%
The entity moves in
a continuous fashion,

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:31.132 align:middle line:10%
and the video clearly shows
its helical structure.

00:40:31.132 --> 00:40:48.844 align:middle line:90%


00:40:48.844 --> 00:40:52.410 align:middle line:10%
The biological entities also
seems to appear in groups.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.800 align:middle line:10%
In 2005, Jesus
Lobeli had already

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.780 align:middle line:10%
filmed three entities together.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.780 align:middle line:10%
Later, Gil also recorded
videos and took photos

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:10%
showing multiple
biological entities.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:10%
But the most striking material,
showing an entire flotilla

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:10%
of EBANIs, was recorded
by Miguel and Gil Chavez

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:10%
in Mexico City.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:84%
In the videos recorded
on the 22nd and 23rd

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.080 align:middle line:84%
of September, 2007,
we can clearly

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.790 align:middle line:84%
see EBANIs of various
colors hovering in the sky,

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.088 align:middle line:84%
but moving in their
characteristic way.

00:41:30.088 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.760 align:middle line:84%
The aerial biological
entities seem

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to be connected to the
presence of spheres

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in the skies over our
planet, and their activity

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:84%
it also seems to have
increased over the course

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:90%
of recent years.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Alone, in pairs, or in
flotillas of varying number,

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:21.056 align:middle line:84%
they are being increasingly
captured on film.

00:42:21.056 --> 00:42:46.490 align:middle line:90%


00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:49.220 align:middle line:84%
However, they've only been
seen in their metallic form

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.894 align:middle line:84%
a few times, as in this video
recorded by Arturo Robles Gil.

00:42:53.894 --> 00:43:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
videos of flotillas

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.860 align:middle line:84%
formed of metal spheres
are rarer than those

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.900 align:middle line:90%
formed of light spheres.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:40.060 align:middle line:90%


00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.685 align:middle line:84%
In Flavio Alcantara's video, we
see a dark EBANI, and nearby,

00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:46.870 align:middle line:90%
a similarly dark flying sphere.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:90%


00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:84%
The connection between
EBANI and spheres

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.740 align:middle line:84%
has really been revealed so
clearly as in the sighting

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:13.600 align:middle line:84%
by Arturo Robles Gil of
the 27th of October, 2004.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But there are other images in
which the two phenomena appear

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.640 align:middle line:84%
In the first video,
we see the EBANI

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.970 align:middle line:84%
looking like it's closed in on
itself, moving independently

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.330 align:middle line:90%
of the spheres surrounding it.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:30.280 align:middle line:84%
In this case, too, this
autonomous movement

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.790 align:middle line:84%
confirms that these are
not balls or balloons.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.090 align:middle line:84%
In the second film,
we can clearly

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.185 align:middle line:84%
see the EBANI twist
and change form

00:44:58.185 --> 00:45:01.405 align:middle line:84%
while a remarkable number of
white spheres move around it.

00:45:01.405 --> 00:45:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.280 align:middle line:84%
We can make out spheres
which are less visible,

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.280 align:middle line:84%
which give a better
perception of the flotilla's

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.180 align:middle line:90%
depth in the sky.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.645 align:middle line:10%
This elegant and
majestic entity has now

00:45:17.645 --> 00:45:20.741 align:middle line:10%
been flying over our cities
with increasing frequency.

00:45:20.741 --> 00:45:23.570 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Just a few meters seems
to separate humanity

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.014 align:middle line:84%
from an extraordinary and
unexplainable phenomenon.

00:45:30.014 --> 00:45:39.020 align:middle line:90%


00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The phenomenon of
the flying objects,

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.560 align:middle line:90%
incorrectly termed UFOs, exists.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.900 align:middle line:10%
I can confirm this based on
the amount of evidence we have

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.290 align:middle line:10%
and the proof I've seen.

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:57.620 align:middle line:10%
Not just my evidence,
but also the evidence

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:10%
produced by my colleagues
and others outside Mexico.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.720 align:middle line:84%
We receive material
from all over Mexico.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, I get
direct access to it.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one who examines
and selects the material.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The UFO phenomenon in both
Mexico and throughout the world

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.110 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Demetrio Feria's statements
are supported by the incredible

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:36.050 align:middle line:10%
number of videos he has
recorded up to the present,

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:10%
and by the incredible
technological abilities that

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.290 align:middle line:10%
the flying objects
seem to possess.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:58.440 align:middle line:90%


00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.070 align:middle line:10%
>> So far I've been able
to record about 400 videos

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:05.080 align:middle line:10%
in the 16 years I've been
studying this phenomenon.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:11.340 align:middle line:90%


00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.550 align:middle line:10%
Of the videos I've made, the
one that stood out the most

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.250 align:middle line:10%
is the one of a sphere
that I filmed from my house

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.760 align:middle line:10%
with an infrared lens.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.330 align:middle line:10%
It's a little sphere
which couldn't

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:25.050 align:middle line:10%
be seen with the naked
eye, but it was in the sky.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:26.850 align:middle line:10%
These objects are in the air.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.400 align:middle line:10%
They live with us.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:39.490 align:middle line:10%
The sphere comes down and slows
down until it almost stops.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Then it flies off at
an incredible speed.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.480 align:middle line:84%
On several occasions I've been
able to film objects flying

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.400 align:middle line:90%
at a phenomenal speed.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I have many such videos.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Their speed amazes me.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:59.250 align:middle line:10%
>> On the 5th of November, 2006,
Demetrio Feria used an infrared

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:02.790 align:middle line:10%
lens applied to his video
camera to film, once again,

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.700 align:middle line:10%
a sphere darting around
at very high speed.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:38.230 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.370 align:middle line:10%
Can the remarkable movements
of the sphere filmed

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.100 align:middle line:10%
by the Vigilantes be
called accidental?

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:10%
Its speed, the angle
at which it flies,

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:53.712 align:middle line:10%
its ability to make itself
invisible and then visible,

00:48:53.712 --> 00:48:55.420 align:middle line:10%
which is only discernible
through the use

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:10%
of infrared lenses,
puts these craft

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.620 align:middle line:10%
beyond our current technical
and scientific knowledge.

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.180 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary claims
thus far presented

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.430 align:middle line:84%
seem to suggest that the
UFO phenomenon could truly

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.145 align:middle line:84%
be the part of intelligent
beings seeking contact.

00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Some people think of the words
of an ancient Mayan prophecy

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that pointed to our time as
the period in which humanity

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.690 align:middle line:84%
was to encounter the
Lord from the Stars.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:50:08.530 align:middle line:90%


00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And according to some, the video
of seven light spheres forming

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.390 align:middle line:84%
a perfect cross,
recorded by Steve

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Burns on the 15th
of August, 2005,

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in the skies above Florida may
be a message to be deciphered.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The video of the cross was
recorded in St. Petersburg,

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.780 align:middle line:10%
Florida on Sunday,
the 14th of August.

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.820 align:middle line:84%
We know that Mr.
Steve Burns filmed it.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:52.350 align:middle line:90%


00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:54.960 align:middle line:84%
We have analyzed the
video and verified

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't
computer generated,

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and thus it's a truly
exceptional document.

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.901 align:middle line:84%
The video was made 15
days before the arrival

00:51:07.901 --> 00:51:08.775 align:middle line:90%
of Hurricane Katrina.

00:51:08.775 --> 00:51:15.570 align:middle line:90%


00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:17.190 align:middle line:84%
It appears to
announce the beginning

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.230 align:middle line:84%
of a final process
that could come

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to an end in the next few years.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.160 align:middle line:90%


00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.350 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing great
changes on Earth,

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:30.410 align:middle line:90%
such as changes in climate.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.570 align:middle line:84%
We're facing seriously
dangerous situations.

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Global warming and continually
increasing solar activity

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.750 align:middle line:84%
are factors that could
cause huge changes

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.820 align:middle line:90%
in the next few years.

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a kind of
warning, an indication of what

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:46.560 align:middle line:90%
might come to pass.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why I see this as a
very important sign, a very

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.840 align:middle line:90%
important video.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:52:05.386 align:middle line:90%


00:52:05.386 --> 00:52:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> There are those who are
anxiously waiting for the year

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.750 align:middle line:84%
2012, the moment of change
that the Maya had predicted

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.990 align:middle line:90%
centuries ago.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:17.060 align:middle line:84%
It could represent the
beginning of a new era of peace

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.242 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:52:18.242 --> 00:52:28.850 align:middle line:90%


00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:30.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd say that the
signs are there,

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:35.030 align:middle line:10%
and this massive contact between
man and extraterrestrials will

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.440 align:middle line:10%
be the sign of a new era.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:45.080 align:middle line:84%
To be precise, and I also want
to say that in my opinion,

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.970 align:middle line:90%
this presence is peaceful.

There's no invasion.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:54.650 align:middle line:84%
There will be no wars between
man and extraterrestrials

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.960 align:middle line:84%
because these
civilizations are obviously

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.380 align:middle line:84%
much more advanced than
us, both scientifically

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and technologically.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But this goes hand-in-hand with
ethical and spiritual progress.

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, any contact
will be peaceful.

videos be a sign that
there is a coming visit?

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.540 align:middle line:10%
Will there really be direct
contact in the future?

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.300 align:middle line:84%
These questions are
still unanswered.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But each day it

to understanding
the enigma of UFOs,

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the most fascinating
