came up for sale, and he
bought the farm field.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And he slowly but
surely turned it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
into a native

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%

He was one of the first, before
anybody was espousing it,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to say that native
vegetation was the best

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:90%

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
plant native vegetation,
get rid of the invasives.

of the Zacharias Creek

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.965 align:middle line:84%
that ran through on the
other side of the road.

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:90%

was very small and modest,

all, inside out.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And all around his
house, on his porch,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
there were just stacks of
the seedlings and supplies

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
that he was using in the
conservation of these oak

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:90%
trees.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I remember--

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and it just tickled me at the
time what an interesting idea

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:90%
it was--

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
is that he used to buy some kind
of soda in two-liter bottles.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he would cut up
those two-liter bottles

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.005 align:middle line:90%
into long strips.

00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And then those strips
would get all coiled up

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
like a pig's tail,
and he would wrap them

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.697 align:middle line:84%
around the trunks
of his new seedlings

00:06:56.697 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:84%

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The deer would
always be a threat,

eating the little seedlings.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, these
thousands of trees--

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
most of them had
these Coke bottle

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
strips all wrapped around
them to protect their trunks.

>> But a lot of things he
learned were self-taught.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:90%
He would experiment with things.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
He would take an oak tree out of
the forest, and we'd plant it.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And if it didn't succeed,
he'd figure out why.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
He'd test the
acidity of the soil

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and test the acidity of the
soil around the seedling

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:90%
that he took out.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And he'd do things like
that and figure out

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:84%
what would be successful and
why trees grew where they did

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and why certain species
grew in certain areas.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And he has established now an
arboretum that will probably

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:90%
live as long as the trees live.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.079 align:middle line:84%
And it's well-established
at this point.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> He had all sorts of things
that were very important

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of it involved
the planting of oak trees

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:90%
in one sense or another.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.795 align:middle line:84%
And these things were piled
high around his house,

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
waiting for them to be used
on the very next morning when

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:84%
he was going to get up early
and go out there and treat

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
his little babies out there
in the oak tree woods.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> He actually went so far as
to collect seeds from daffodils

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and grow all these
daffodils from seed.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at his
property in the springtime,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
you'll see daffodils all over,
and they're all grown from seed

that he propagated himself.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>> He operates outside
of the box a little.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:90%
And he does what he wants.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And he does it the way he wants.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter's house was not a
typical suburban property.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a small, modest house.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It was on a lot that
was totally wooded.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
There was not a blade of
grass on the entire property.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was not what you'd call
the sterilized sort of look

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that we often see
in suburbia today.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> He bought his original four
acres, and it was a wooded lot.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And he actually took down
as few trees as possible

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:90%
to build his house.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
He actually hand-dug
his foundation

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
in order to avoid destroying any
excess trees, built his house,

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and built the driveway
so it would not

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:90%
disrupt as many trees.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Not typical as the typical
suburban lot where he's cleared

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and there's lawn.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%

It's all wooded lawn.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And he actually built his
house with his own hands.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:90%
He built his house.

00:09:39.442 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, Peter
has passed away.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:10%
And I was invited to actually
speak at his funeral, which

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:10%
was a great honor to me.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:10%
But another person that
spoke at Peter's funeral

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:10%
spoke of Peter's intellect and
his ability to invent things.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:10%
And it was revealed at that
time that Peter actually

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:10%
created a mouse milking
machine, and they

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:10%
needed the milk to create
a vaccine of some sort.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember
what the vaccine was.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:10%
But they were actually
milking mice by hand,

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:10%
and Peter figured out a
way to have a machine that

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:10%
actually milked mice.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the company still
has the patent on this machine.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:10%
And the machine, although it has
been refined, is still in use.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Peter cared about the comfort
and well-being of the mice

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:90%
as he cared about all animals.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
He wanted his nature
preserve to be a safe place

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
where the animals
could hide from danger.

00:12:54.189 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Peter loved rural life.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
He loved trees more
than anything else.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:90%
He loved living in the country.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And he had the fear that he
had moved to the country,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't want it
to move away from him.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:10%
I think that from the time Peter
first moved into Worcester,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:10%
he was concerned that the rural
nature and rural character

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:10%
of this township
was slipping away.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:90%
He loved the trees.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:90%
He loved the fields.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:10%
The developers were busy trying
to build where they could,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:10%
and more houses were
going up all the time,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:10%
and nobody was making
any more farmland.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to preserve what we
could before it was too late.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I think that he felt that
he wanted to do some part,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
especially in his
end of the world,

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.507 align:middle line:84%
to protect that as
best he was able to do.

00:14:04.507 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Because he was a gentleman
without a family,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.650 align:middle line:84%
without kids to put
his energy into,

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.876 align:middle line:84%
I think he redirected
that into an unusual way.

00:14:11.876 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But for him, this
was the top priority.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter had an austere,
frugal lifestyle,

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
even heating his home in the
winter with a wood burning

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:90%
stove.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.683 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:31.683 --> 00:16:23.507 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.507 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter was really very much
an advocate for open space

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:90%
throughout Worcester.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:10%
But in particular, he knew
his end of the township best.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And there were a couple of
farms that surrounded him,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
one of which he had,
I think, for years,

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
even before I knew him, worried
that this farm might just

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
go the way of the developers.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was eating at him, and
he wanted it in the worst way

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:90%
and brought it up many times.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
We need to find a way
to save this farm.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We were working with the
township in trying to acquire

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:84%
a conservation easement on the
property and sell the property

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:90%
to actual property owner.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:84%
We had an agreement of
sale with a family trust

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
that owned the property, which
was complicated in itself.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:90%
And we thought we had a buyer.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
At the last minute, the
buyer backed out of the deal,

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and we were left hanging
with this agreement of sale

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
and a short time in
order to get it done.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
This property was near Peter
Schlotterer's property.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to him
about it, and I kept

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:90%
him informed of the process.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.277 align:middle line:84%
He would come into
the office quite often

00:17:27.277 --> 00:17:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and just sit down and
talk to me and ask how

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:90%
different projects were going.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:10%
And I called him and told
him that this project was

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:10%
on the verge of breaking
up because the buyer had

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:10%
backed out and mentioned that
we had to secure the agreement

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:10%
sale.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And along the way, there was
a period of time where Peter

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
was worried that good things
weren't going to happen in time

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:90%
to keep this farm preserved.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter was a very,
very frugal man.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.696 align:middle line:84%
But two days later, he called
me and said, I'll do this.

00:17:57.696 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And what he actually did
was sign an agreement of sale

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:84%
on his own to lock up the
farm so that it would remain

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:84%
available to us until the county
was able to get its funding

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:90%
decisions together.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And I was absolutely stunned.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I never expected
to have Peter step forward

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and say, I will do this,
A, because I didn't

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:90%
know if he had the resources.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
From his lifestyle, he didn't
appear to have the resources.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And he put up close to
$15,000 as down payment

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and signed the agreement of sale
and put his neck on the block.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
That gave us 90 days
until settlement in order

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.951 align:middle line:90%
to find that underlying buyer.

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that was
remarkable about Peter helping

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.491 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the piece of
farmland adjacent to his

00:18:42.491 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:84%
property was that for a
gentleman who had spent his

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
life saving much more than
he spent his life spending,

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
he stepped up to the plate at
a time when the feasibility

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:90%
of this deal was a question.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> He put his neck out, and he
would have had to purchase that

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
property for 300 and some
odd thousand dollars if we

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.524 align:middle line:84%
hadn't found the
underlying buyer.

00:19:04.524 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought that was
remarkable for a person of his

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:90%
personality.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter Schlotterer had
a unique personality.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:90%
He was very frugal.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:90%
He was risk averse.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:10%
He didn't like to
take big risks.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.120 align:middle line:90%
He didn't like to spend money.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:10%
I would call him
somewhat introverted.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
He was very quiet
man, kept to himself.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Although he had quite
a number of friends

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and quite a number of
people that he influenced,

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
he was definitely
not a partygoer.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter wasn't what
you'd call a big spender.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of putting
that kind of money

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:84%
up from his
retirement plan, which

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe was not
extraordinary, was a major step

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:90%
up to the plate.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a very risky deal.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:10%
And I can remember
when we were going

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:10%
to sign the agreement of sale
when he had to write the check

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:10%
and put down the down money,
we sat in the parking lot

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:10%
for 45 minutes and
talked about the deal.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Peter, you
don't have to do this.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I can take you home, and he
said, no, let's go do it.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It was very impressive
to me that he

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:84%
loved his land in
that area so much,

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:84%
loved the idea of
keeping space open,

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that he would take
that risk in order

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:90%
to see it come to fruition.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of Peter's efforts,
the field and his own property

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
will remain forever free from
development and connects with

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
adjacent farm and parkland,
creating a small green belt

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of the state's
most populated county.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.636 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:38.636 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter's actions
inspired a lot of people.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:10%
He helped fund a
scholarship at Temple Ambler

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:10%
campus, ecological restoration.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Peter was instrumental
in supporting us financially

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:10%
in a couple of different ways,
one of which was to set up

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:10%
the ecological
restoration scholarships,

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:10%
which allow students here
at Temple Ambler to study

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:10%
ecological restoration.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we've had about 20
different students that have

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:90%
come through under his program.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we have
three currently studying

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
ecological restoration
in various ways.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting here in the
sustainable wetland garden,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the Ambler
Arboretum of Temple University.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Peter financially
supported the setup

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
of this garden, the design,
the installation, and also

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.062 align:middle line:90%
its ongoing maintenance.

00:23:57.062 --> 00:24:02.114 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.114 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Really, some of the principles
that it demonstrates,

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
such as the use of materials,
the sustainable use

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:84%
of native plants, the
infiltration of the water,

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:84%
are all things
that Peter valued.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at Peter's life
and what he did with himself

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and how he was so aware of
his surroundings and educated

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%
himself about his surroundings
and realized the impact of his

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:84%
actions on the earth, I think
that's something that we could

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:90%
all benefit from.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
He was fully aware of,
if he had created trash;

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:90%
where the trash went.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:84%
He was just very aware of his
surroundings and his actions

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and how they affected not
only the natural environment

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:90%
but also the people around him.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:90%
He was a very astute person.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The township felt that we
needed to remember the work

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.150 align:middle line:10%
that Peter had done.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:10%
And we got the
idea that we should

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:10%
erect a monument of some
sort on the property

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:10%
that he had helped to preserve.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:10%
And we had a brass plaque
made with some very nice

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.715 align:middle line:10%
inscriptions on it that
basically thanked Peter--

00:25:29.715 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:10%
this is during his lifetime--
for the work that he had done.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I think others could be inspired
by Peter's legacy in that what

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Peter did was he had
a vision, and then he

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.278 align:middle line:84%
decided that he was going
to do something about it.

00:25:47.278 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter died at the age of
83, after suffering a stroke.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
His actions helped save dozens
of acres from development

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and continue to educate
future generations

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
in ecological restoration.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:84%
He left behind him a legacy
of respect for nature

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and the people he knew.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:40.192 align:middle line:90%
