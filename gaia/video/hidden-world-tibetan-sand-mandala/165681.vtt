Everything else comes secondary.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have
these four, there's

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:10%
nothing else you can build on.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:10%
So that's basic
survival of the humans.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:10%
The resultant effect
is helping ourselves.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>> On the fourth
day of construction,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:90%
the mandala is completed.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
The mandala represents
the floor plan

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
of a celestial
palace and functions

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
as an illustration
of tantric teachings

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:90%
and as an aid to meditation.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
The sand mandala
is a work of art

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that is intended to
exist temporarily.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
On the fifth day, it
is ritually dismantled.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:10%
The dismantling of sand mandala
is a tantric Buddhist ritual.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:10%
We see on various levels--
on different levels,

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:10%
we see change.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.815 align:middle line:10%
And we see destruction.

00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:10%
We see aging.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:10%
We see this process
of impermanence.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:53.210 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't stay in
one part or one state.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't stagnate.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:10%
There's a continuous
flow, but this is change.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:10%
And the change is impermanence.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:10%
But it's human or the
environment outside.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:10%
So to symbolize and to
remind all the humans

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:10%
and all the living beings
that somehow, our lives--

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:10%
both ours as well
as the environment--

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:10%
is all impermanent.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:10%
Nothing stays forever.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:10%
So it's a change in progression.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:10%
So accordingly, we should
remind ourselves to prioritize

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.230 align:middle line:10%
our things in life.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.715 align:middle line:84%
So that's a reminder of
dismantling the sand mandala.

00:19:32.715 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:10%
We It's create it
for several days

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:10%
through such hard
work and dedication,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:10%
painstaking concentration
and focus and training

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:10%
and all the compassion and love.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out to be
wonderful, beautiful, visual

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:10%
art, and then it is destroyed.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:10%
So that's the
nature impermanence

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:10%
to remind ourselves.

the vessel containing
the sand is

prepared for the final
ceremony, where it will be

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.760 align:middle line:90%
dispersed into a nearby creek.

>> Dispersement of sand in
the creek or in the river

00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:10%
or in the water body
is to symbolize,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:10%
through the course of several
days of creation of sand

00:22:53.650 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:10%
mandala, we as humans get the
opportunity and the privilege

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:10%
and the blessing not
only to see and witness,

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:10%
but also to get the blessing of
hearing the importance of it,

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:10%
the teachings of it, the
advantages and different ways

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:10%
through which we can rise
up to the highest state

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:10%
of enlightenment.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:10%
So, pouring the sand and
dispersing it in the water,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:10%
it also gives an
opportunity for all the sea

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:10%
creatures that the
sand comes in contact

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:10%
as it washes down through
the water and the river.

Their physical sickness

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:10%
will all be healed.
