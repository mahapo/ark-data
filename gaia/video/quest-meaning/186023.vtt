the mines get closed

as a result of our study.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I realized then that with
a focus and with dedication,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:90%
there was so much one could do.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And sitting in privileged
jobs, isolated from society,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
you could keep making
excuses, but you

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't bring the change.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So I threw up my
job, came back home,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
started to work from
my mother's cowshed,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%

been doing since then.

So things are
changing, but they are

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
changing in the wrong direction,
because the dominant change is

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:84%
driven by giant corporations
who are turning everything

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.652 align:middle line:84%
into a market and turning
everything into a commodity.

is a change that

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%

that if we continue

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:84%
in this present path
of change, humanity

that nature is

the condition of our being alive
is the shift we have to make.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%

the leaves will

and that will become
nutrients to the roots.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And that nutrition

Tenoch, a healer who

We're not feeding
everyone in the world

because our limited
consciousness hasn't

come to a solution that allows

a necessity to do that.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.810 align:middle line:84%
we're helping people see
how they view everything

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.910 align:middle line:90%
through a worldview.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though
they're looking

through a pair of glasses.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And their worldview
arises from many factors--

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:34.330 align:middle line:84%
genetics, culture, religion,
how they were raised,

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:36.570 align:middle line:84%
what they've learned in
school, the experiences

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.410 align:middle line:90%
they've had in their lives.

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And most of us are not aware of
the worldviews we're holding.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:90%
We think they're just the truth.

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things that
self inquiry brings to us,

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.450 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
contemplative practices can

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:59.280 align:middle line:84%
do for us, is we begin to
recognize that our thoughts are

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.960 align:middle line:90%
just thoughts.

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Our beliefs are
just our beliefs.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
really who we are.

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:09.750 align:middle line:84%
They're just sort of
working hypotheses.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So you may be, for example,
sitting in meditation

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and find out, wow, I really see
the world as a dangerous place,

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's been influencing
everything since the time I

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.370 align:middle line:90%
was a little kid.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:34.150 align:middle line:84%
What if I didn't see the
world as a dangerous place?

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And when that kind
of a shift happens,

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:42.880 align:middle line:84%
behavior changes, thoughts
change, relationships change,

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:46.610 align:middle line:84%
motivations, priorities,
values change.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.730 align:middle line:84%

kind of transformation

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:50.200 align:middle line:90%

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:15.640 align:middle line:84%
When I first was
talking about this,

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.490 align:middle line:90%
people said, oh, he's crazy.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.270 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're crazy.

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And now I say some
of the things I say,

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:25.985 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists go, what,
are you saying that's new?

00:57:25.985 --> 00:57:26.785 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm boring.

00:57:26.785 --> 00:57:30.570 align:middle line:90%


00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:33.750 align:middle line:84%
The world as we see
it is an expression

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:36.950 align:middle line:84%
of the collective beliefs
of the population,

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:39.150 align:middle line:90%
or least a large number of them.

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And therefore when
we look at the world

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:45.390 align:middle line:84%
today in crisis and failing,
and science recognize

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that the extinction
that lies in front of us

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.160 align:middle line:84%
is due to human behavior, and
that human behavior has been

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.810 align:middle line:84%
programmed by
culture, then it says

00:57:55.810 --> 00:58:00.650 align:middle line:84%
if you want to evolve
and survive this crisis,

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:84%
we have to change
the belief systems.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's-- I love
the famous quote.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you cannot solve the
problems with the same thinking

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:12.100 align:middle line:90%
that created the problem.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And the beliefs
are based on this.

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:17.530 align:middle line:84%
There are three
questions they call

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.960 align:middle line:84%
the perennial questions
that have been asked

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.357 align:middle line:90%
by humans for 10,000 years.

00:58:24.357 --> 00:58:25.190 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:28.350 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And how do we make
the best of it?

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:37.840 align:middle line:90%


00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.270 align:middle line:90%
The answers to the questions--

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:43.150 align:middle line:84%
when a population
accepts the answers

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:46.900 align:middle line:84%
from some individual
or some organization,

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.000 align:middle line:84%
they also make that
individual or organization

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the truth provider for the
rest of the questions of life.

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The church said the
spiritual world is primary,

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.340 align:middle line:84%
but science, especially
after Isaac Newton,

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:04.310 align:middle line:84%
said you don't need to
have a spiritual element.

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just the physical world.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:06.470 align:middle line:90%
It's like a clock.

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a machine.

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:10.610 align:middle line:90%


00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So when science
took over, it was

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.210 align:middle line:84%
after Charles Darwin, because
Charles Darwin provided

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:19.690 align:middle line:90%
the answers to the questions.

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:23.650 align:middle line:84%
We got here through
random mutations.

00:59:23.650 --> 00:59:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.283 align:middle line:90%
No reason at all.

00:59:26.283 --> 00:59:27.325 align:middle line:90%
Because it's an accident.

00:59:27.325 --> 00:59:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.870 align:middle line:90%
How do you make the best of it?

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was when everything
went crazy, because it said,

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.850 align:middle line:90%
oh, you live in a struggle.

00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Evolution is a struggle, and
to survive, you've got to fight

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and you've got to compete.

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So we bought a belief that
the world is not our friend,

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have to go out every
day and fight for life.

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:51.570 align:middle line:90%
So we bought that belief.

00:59:51.570 --> 01:00:03.400 align:middle line:90%


01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the world
we live in today--

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.670 align:middle line:84%
the belief of the
material world,

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:09.010 align:middle line:84%
spirit's not really
relevant, and that we're

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:13.150 align:middle line:84%
in competition to who's going
to win and who's going to die.

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Those beliefs have now changed
because the leading edge

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.370 align:middle line:90%
of science has new answers.

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't get here
through random mutation,

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:24.610 align:middle line:84%
we got here through what are
called adaptive mutations--

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the ability of an organism
to fit the environment.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And so every organism was part
of a collection of a whole.

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:34.180 align:middle line:84%
There was no individual
organism showing up.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They were all created to
fit into the structure

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.940 align:middle line:84%
of the environment--
the biosphere.

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.350 align:middle line:90%
So we had a purpose.

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:46.450 align:middle line:84%
We were here to bring
harmony to the environment.

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:49.600 align:middle line:90%


01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And because we
haven't done that,

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.960 align:middle line:90%
we are now risking our lives.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So the evolution is pushing
us to the next higher level

01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that
we are all one.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
All of humanity is one
organism, and we are the cells.

And that when we fight each
other, we're killing ourselves

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.557 align:middle line:90%
