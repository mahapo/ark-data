Well, when I was a young child,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I remember very
clearly reading a book,

and it was called, The
Boy Who Sang to the World.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
In this book, a boy
would sing to the world,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:84%

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:90%
were drug addicts.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So she thought that if
I picked up the guitar,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:90%
I would become a drug addict.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this was
the time of folk music,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and that was really
what I was moving into,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:84%
so I had to save up
my money, because she

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:90%
refused to buy me a guitar.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.290 align:middle line:84%
She said, if you're
going to have a guitar,

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.123 align:middle line:90%
you must get it yourself.

00:13:58.123 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
One night I went into
a lounge, and they

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
had, like, amateur
night or something,

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and I played, and
they offered me a job,

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%
so I became a lounge singer.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So I would play
guitar and piano.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So I performed at the place
underneath the Chinese

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
restaurant, and two friends
of mine-- Marty and Kim--

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:90%
helped run it.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was hanging
sheet rock at the time,

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and went into this story about
how his landlady was kicking

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
him out, and then he sang,
Can't Find My Way Home,

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and so I went up to
Marty, I said, this guy

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have any place to live.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's ask him to live with
us, and we did that night.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.641 align:middle line:84%
And he came and he
lived with us for about--

00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:90%
A couple--

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:84%
 --a year and a
half, two years.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.960 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, year and and
a half, or two years.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:10%
He was writing a lot
of music at that point,

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:10%
and he really was hoping that
he would make it as a singer.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I was really into pop rock,
but I didn't have the resources

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to get to Los Angeles.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I lived in North Carolina,
so Nashville was closer.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So I started writing
country songs.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Nashville,
and worked in restaurants,

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and gigs-- music gigs.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And the really weird thing was
that the record engineer guys--

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I would go in for sessions,
and they would say,

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.985 align:middle line:90%
you're really, really good.

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:90%
You're really talented.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.295 align:middle line:84%
Just wait-- somebody's
going to pick you up.

00:15:22.295 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It was autumn--
early autumn-- and I

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:84%
was walking across a cow
pasture of my uncle's

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:90%
farm in North Carolina.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And I sat underneath a
tree, I folded my legs

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in like a half Lotus-- I didn't
even know what I was doing--

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and then my hands
went spontaneously

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:90%
into these mudras.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
underneath the tree like a Yogi

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:84%
from Muskogee, and my hands
are doing these weird mudras.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I went into a deep place
and the world disappeared.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I had no sensory
experience of the world.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought it lasted
for a few moments,

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
but when I opened my
eyes, the sun was setting,

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:90%
so several hours had passed.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And several cows
had wandered over

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and were staring at me,
when I opened my eyes.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:10%
For whatever reason, a white boy
is walking across a cow pasture

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.935 align:middle line:10%
one autumn afternoon,
and goes into

00:16:18.935 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:10%
a spontaneous yogic samadhi,
and experiences Sat Chit Ananda.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:10%
And the impact of
that was so profound

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:10%
that for hours afterwards I
was in love with the world.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
love of everything,

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and I was a deep place
of contentment and peace.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know what samadhi
was or what [INAUDIBLE] were,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and so I started to search
for what the meaning

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.075 align:middle line:90%
was of that experience.

00:16:43.075 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I started researching
and studying,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and discovered the
mystic contemplatives

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Middle Ages.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:10%
They were describing something
of what I had experienced,

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:10%
but with not the
complete picture.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:10%
But one of the roots of
that spiritual tradition

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:10%
is contemplative, and
is an inner journey,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:10%
and that's what I
became interested in.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.837 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a Catholic
college for two years,

00:17:12.837 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
that I was going

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:90%
to become a Trappist monk.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was drawn to the Trappists
because they're a silent order,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
which would be ironic
if I had become

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
a Trappist, with a voice,
and I would become silent.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.971 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Shhh.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
TOM KENYON: I went to the mass,
and I was mesmerized, and fell

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:84%
in love with the
mass-- with the Latin,

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and the incense, and the
gold, and the pageantry,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:90%
the stained glass.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it just so happened
that they did the mass

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:84%
in English, and
for the first time,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.002 align:middle line:84%
I heard what they
were actually saying.

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And I could not
accept that reality,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:90%
because it was guilt and shame.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Guilt and shame.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Mea culpa, mea culpa,
mea maxima culpa.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't accept
that, because when

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I went into these
mystical experiences

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was with St. Teresa,
or I was with St. Francis,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:84%
or I was with Mary-- I had a
lot of experiences with Mary,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
the mother-- there
was no shame and there

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:90%
was no guilt from any of them.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a pure agape-- pure
love-- without any condition.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So I was having these mystical
experiences that were typical

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:84%
of people in the 13th,
14th, 15th centuries,

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm living in a 20th century
world, and that was a mismatch.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:90%
So I left the church behind.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And the quest was about
understanding what

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
mystical experiences were,
and bringing the human

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and the divine together.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Can you bring them together?

00:18:50.880 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Sophia means wisdom.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics say that Sophia
is actually the heroine

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and the protector of humanity.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:17.591 align:middle line:84%
She's said to be the
feminine counterpart to God.

00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
-[INAUDIBLE]
-Yes.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It would.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.778 align:middle line:90%

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:10%
I continued my education at the
University of North Carolina,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:10%
Greensboro, minored
in psychology,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.190 align:middle line:10%
and I was taking a class on
psychosis, which is, basically,

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.674 align:middle line:10%
the mental state
where a person is

00:21:21.674 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:10%
seeing things that
aren't there, and hearing

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.973 align:middle line:10%
things that aren't there.

00:21:23.973 --> 00:21:27.104 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.104 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But I remember it
was a spring day,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm on my way-- I was
on my way to this class,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and I had read the notes, so I
knew what it was talking about.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And on either side
of me are two angels,

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:90%
suddenly, out of the blue.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Complete with the
frigging wings.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
They're about nine feet
tall, with white wings--

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:84%
brilliant white-- emanating
white light brilliantly.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was aware that it was
a mental impression, so it

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:90%
was not a true hallucination.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I was aware
that it was coming from somehow

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, but I experienced
them as physically

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%
real outside of me.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I became
absolutely freaked out,

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm going to a
class on psychosis,

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and two angels are
walking beside me.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:84%
What if I walk in the
class and nobody sees them?

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Or, worse, what if I walk in the
class and people do see them?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:90%
How do I explain them?

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And what was really
weird in that

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:84%
moment was I felt this immense
love coming from them that was

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:84%
just, like, melting me, but my
paranoia about who they were,

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and what was this, and are
they real, was so big, I said,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
you guys have to go away, and
they-- poof-- they disappeared.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I went into psychology,
looking back at it,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to discover if
maybe I was crazy.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And I found among my fellow
students that many of us

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:84%
were in the psych
department for that reason.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I lived in an old
dilapidated house

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:90%
that should've been condemned.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I had a mattress on
one corner of the room,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and there was half
written papers, and books,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and laundry, and
food, and dust balls,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
thing of a student.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the room,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I had an altar, and pictures
of the saints of all

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
the traditions I was
exploring, and a prayer rug,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and it was pristine.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was this tension
between me as Tom the person

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and Tom the aspiring yogi.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And so really the quest was, how
do you bring the two together?

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
There were several incidences in
my education at the university

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:90%
that were significant for me.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
One of them was the discovery
that your physiology

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:84%
could be used as a language to
explain mystical experiences.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
The whole time while I was going
through my scientific training,

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I was going deeper into
the mysticism of the East.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.950 align:middle line:84%
The yoga of India,
Taosim of China,

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian alchemy,
Tibetan Buddhism.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I was practicing
every meditation

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:90%
from every tradition.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I would sometimes
spend five hours a day

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:90%
meditating different practices.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I was changing
my neurophysiology

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and not realizing it.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So I had been doing Kundalini
practices along with everything

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
else, and it was spring, people
were in the quadrangle throwing

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Frisbees, there were
high-rise dorms,

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there just
enjoying everything, and then

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:90%
all of a sudden I hear this--

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:90%
[RATTLESNAKE SOUND]

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
--sound, that goes right
up my spine, like a snake.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
symbolism, Kundalini shakti

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:90%
is symbolized as a cobra.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.175 align:middle line:84%
And that's because, as the
energy rises up the spine, when

00:24:42.175 --> 00:24:46.694 align:middle line:84%
it hits the brain, it spreads
out like the hood of a cobra,

00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and what it's doing is actually
going through both hemispheres

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And this shakti-- this
immense electric charge--

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
was going into my brain, and
just lit up all these centers.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
My experience was that the
dorms became transparent.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I could see through the walls,
and I could feel every emotion

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.410 align:middle line:84%
of all the thousand
or so students that

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
were in the area-- their
hopes, their dreams,

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:84%
their fears, going into
exams, all that stuff.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I started-- then
I heard the sound again--

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%
[RATTLESNAKE SOUND]

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
--and another surge
went up into my brain,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.715 align:middle line:84%
and I felt really hot,
like burning up-- it's

00:25:25.715 --> 00:25:29.180 align:middle line:84%
called psychic fire
in the tradition.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know what it was.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I start to
walk back to the dorm,

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and as I'm going
back to the dorm,

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:84%
my friends are going to lunch,
and they're walking by me,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and say, come on with us, Tom.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And I say, no, I can't, I'm
going to go back and lie down.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was weird was, it
was like my perception was

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:90%
they were in a different movie.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I could see the movie, but I
couldn't step into their movie.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I was another movie.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.725 align:middle line:90%
So I am hot.

00:25:58.725 --> 00:26:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm so hot, I want
to go to the dorm

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and just get a cold shower,
and then I'm getting so weak,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
it's like I have
no energy to move.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I look, and it's-- I look
to the right, and that's where

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
the student health center is.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And my dorm is about
another 500 yards away,

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and the student health
center is right here,

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I'm--
literally, the life

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:90%
force is draining out of me.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So I walk towards
the health center,

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and literally, the energy
leaves my arms and my hands,

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and I have to crawl in onto
the porch-- I'm crawling in--

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and this is really
bizarre-- I'm crawling

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:90%
into the health center.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And I sit in a chair,
and the nurse comes in,

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:90%
and I show her my ID.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
She takes my temperature
and she turns ashen white.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
All I remember is her
eyes got really wide,

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and her color changed,
and she ran off.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
In comes the doctor, and
the next thing I know,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a private
room, and they're

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.095 align:middle line:90%
giving me whatever medicine.

00:26:56.095 --> 00:26:57.395 align:middle line:84%
I still, , to this
day, don't know what

00:26:57.395 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:90%
medicines they're giving me.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I didn't say
anything about a snake going up

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
my spine, or seeing through
the walls of the dorms,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:90%
or any of that.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:90%
What I presented was a fever.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So they put me in
a medical wing,

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:90%
not the psychological wing.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And so for three
days I was delirious.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Because what my understanding
of what happened

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:84%
was, that the Kundalini
had gone into an area

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.890 align:middle line:84%
of my neurophysiology-- subtle
neurophysiology-- the chakra

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:84%
system and the
nadis, where there

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
were impurities, because I had
not prepared myself properly.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I had pushed the river.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And for three days
I was in a state

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%
of delirium and a high fever.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the images
vividly to this day.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:90%
There were two sets of them.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.675 align:middle line:84%
One was I was on a raft
floating on an ocean--

00:27:48.675 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:84%
a vast ocean with dark
clouds, with sea monsters

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to grab me
off of the raft

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and pull me down
into the depths.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:84%
That's classic
Jungian psychology.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
The ocean is the
unconscious, it was stirred,

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:90%
and emotions, and all of that.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:90%
And this went on for three days.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the other vision was, I
would be driving along a desert

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
in my grandfather's
Ford, and I would

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:84%
see the sunset in the hub of
the wheel-- the steering wheel.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And off in the distance
was a little, like,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
an adobe in the desert, and
I knew that in that house

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:84%
was somebody who knew the
secret of the universe.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And as I got closer,
it would hop away,

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:90%
and I could never get to it.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I came out
of the delirium,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and I was weak for
about six weeks,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to regain my strength,
from a premature experience

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:90%
with Kundalini shakti.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:50.422 align:middle line:84%
So I became very respectful
of this primordial power.

can go through that door,

mysteries in themselves

that they never imagined.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So after my
undergraduate degree,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I went to California to study
something called whole brain

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.230 align:middle line:84%
learning, which is
a method for using

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
music, sound, and
frequency to open up

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:90%
latent potentials of the brain.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this body
of knowledge about sound

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and how it could affect altered
states of consciousness,

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and psychological
counseling, and

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:middle line:90%
different psychological states.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge, for me, was
to bring those two together.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered the work
of Losanov of Bulgaria--

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:90%
the Losanov Institute.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:10%
And he was documenting how music
could increase alpha activity,

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:10%
which is a precursor to the
lower brain activity of theta,

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.391 align:middle line:10%
and this is the range
of hypnotic states

00:32:24.391 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.190 align:middle line:10%

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was a study done
with premature babies,

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:84%

and Brahms' Lullaby was not
played to another group.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And what happened with the
Brahms' babies was that they

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.990 align:middle line:84%
were released from the hospital
an average of a week earlier,

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.430 align:middle line:84%

that the structure of the music

of Brahms-- these
particular pieces-- soothed

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:90%
respiration, stress hormones.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And the sound, the music, the
structure, the architecture,

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:84%
the tambor-- the sound
quality of the instruments--

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:84%
the rhythm, very
importantly, and the melody

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:84%
soothed the brain and
created this increase

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.430 align:middle line:90%
of alpha response.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.957 align:middle line:84%
So the babies were having an
opportunity for self-healing,

00:33:28.957 --> 00:33:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
what was occurring.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So I formed Acoustic
Brain Research in 1983

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
to scientifically
look at how music

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and sound affect the brain.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was a loose
collection of researchers

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
all over the country--
universities,

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
independent labs--
looking at sound patterns

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that I would compose,
and look at how

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:84%
it would affect the brain,
mostly through EEG studies.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So I started writing
music for my clients

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate
therapy, and to reach

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.940 align:middle line:90%
deeper states of consciousness.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have one
part of the brain that

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is more dominant than
the other in terms

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:90%
of filtering the experience.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
that's the left.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's the logical,
sequential side.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Then the other side of the
brain-- the right hemisphere--

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:90%
is spatial intelligence.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very
happy with paradox,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's comfortable where
two things that are opposite

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:90%
exist simultaneously.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.199 align:middle line:90%
The left brain can't stand that.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And the brain research shows
that when you are experiencing

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.120 align:middle line:84%
pure sound without language,
the right side of the brain

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:90%
lights up like a Christmas tree.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And all types of phenomena
occur in the right hemisphere

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.714 align:middle line:84%
that do not occur over here
in the left hemisphere.

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:46.219 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
a sound meditation

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:84%

to the same space.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.526 align:middle line:84%

simply bring it back.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.965 align:middle line:84%
And then I had an encounter that
was totally unexpected, and out

uninvited with a group

I'd worked in brain
research for about 13 years

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:10%
before I encountered
the Hathors,

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.850 align:middle line:10%
so I had some understanding
of how sound and music affect

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.340 align:middle line:10%
the braih-- that was my focus.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had, I thought, some
idea of what reality was,

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and altered states of
consciousness-- that's

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And so then these beings showed
up in a meditation retreat--

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a Siddha Yoga
retreat-- silent, by myself,

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.650 align:middle line:90%
nobody else around.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they said they came
from another universe,

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and so my mind was,
like, this is insanity.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So I was having these psychic
experiences with the Hathors

this was a delusion.

I went to my Jungian training.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.110 align:middle line:84%
They're simply archetypes,
so they're not real.

real, but they're

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
not really real, you know,
they're aspects of the mind.

was kind of a dead end,

to-- in certain castes-- is

I knew he was some

And I called, and I left
a message, and I said,

I have an amazing friend, and
I need to find the most amazing

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%

if you could be the Christmas

And it hadn't been--
and I hung up the phone,

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and thought, oh
my god, you fool.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And Tom called back.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Fine and dandy.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.895 align:middle line:84%
And he unzips this suitcase, and
brings out this crystal bowl,

01:10:24.895 --> 01:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, huh,
I wonder what that is?

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what he's going
to do with that thing?

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And he started making sound,
and I went to another dimension.

01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time my
consciousness-- my brain

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.032 align:middle line:84%

altered by sound.

I don't, I don't,
I don't do this.

I said, you don't do what?

He said, I don't see

I don't do private sessions.

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I was like, my first
thought was, well, then,

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.220 align:middle line:90%
why did you do this?

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.590 align:middle line:90%
And said that, being me.

Why am I here?

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do this?

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, because the
Hathors told me to.

in Greensboro, North Carolina.

So my mother, and I, and
my brother were on the bus.

JUDI SION: So I was
in the backseat,

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and I just remember this--
coming alongside a bus,

I call, flying formation.

It could have been

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
for five minutes.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It seemed forever.

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:13.810 align:middle line:84%
TOM KENYON: And so we're
just hovering there,

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and I looked down and there's
this girl who's about my age,

and it was like, oh, hello.

JUDI SION: Deep
in his eyes, there

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.250 align:middle line:84%
was something-- I knew
that little boy was

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
going to play guitar, and
I knew that little boy

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.160 align:middle line:90%
was going to sing.

TOM KENYON: And then
the car passes the bus.

01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I happened to write
about it when I was writing

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
my story for The
Magdalen Manuscript,

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
because it struck my heart
at such a deep level.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was that,
when Tom read my story,

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.360 align:middle line:90%
he said, wow.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
That same thing happened to
me when I was a little boy.

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, but I know
exactly where I was.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.266 align:middle line:84%
I know where I
was, on what road.

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:54.686 align:middle line:84%
He said, so do I. And we
matched it up, and we thought,

01:12:54.686 --> 01:12:55.385 align:middle line:90%
could this be?

01:12:55.385 --> 01:13:06.143 align:middle line:90%


01:13:06.143 --> 01:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Although the Hathors
are androgynous beings,

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:11.320 align:middle line:84%
meaning balanced
between male and female,

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
how they view our
current situation

01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is that it is time that
the feminine nature has

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
to rise up in balance to the
masculine in its expression

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:22.940 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Earth is held
symbolically as feminine.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.120 align:middle line:90%
We even call it Mother Earth.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So the feminine is degredated
and is held in lower esteem

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
in many of our
spiritual traditions,

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
because we have such
disregard for the Earth

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:41.790 align:middle line:90%
itself, and the feminine.

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:44.270 align:middle line:90%


01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
myths in society is

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that here-- everybody
here-- I don't sense

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.760 align:middle line:90%
any virgin births in this room.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So all of us got
here through sex.

01:13:55.750 --> 01:14:00.310 align:middle line:84%
A mother and father had coitus,
and there was a big bang,

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and our culture says that it
was a mad rush of the sperm

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
to get to the egg, and the
first sperm to get to the egg

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.790 align:middle line:90%
was the winner.

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
patriarchal, masculine view.

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But genetics is now discovering
that it's not quite true.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
That the egg actually senses
the approaching horde,

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.410 align:middle line:84%
sends out tentacles
of information,

01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and scans them
before they arrive.

But fundamentally, at a deeper
level, what her message is

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
about is an urgent
message, which

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
is that if we are to survive,
we must raise the feminine

01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:54.330 align:middle line:84%
out the ashes that we have
created as a global culture

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
for centuries, and have
the two meet together--

01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:01.480 align:middle line:84%
male and female together--
not one above the other,

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
but in equality.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:06.953 align:middle line:84%
And with that union,
create a new world.

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the quest has
actually ended, as I

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:47.240 align:middle line:90%
think about it in this moment.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that the
work between the human

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
part of me has ended.

01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:54.750 align:middle line:90%
I've unified the two.

01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:57.550 align:middle line:90%
That war is done.

01:23:57.550 --> 01:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not that the
learning has ended,

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
but the tension between
the human and the spiritual

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:07.700 align:middle line:90%
has ended.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:12.370 align:middle line:90%


01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And the final piece of that is
realizing that the boy who sang

01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
to the world, he had
a misunderstanding,

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and his misunderstanding
was that he could resolve

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.470 align:middle line:90%
the suffering of others.

01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:28.310 align:middle line:84%
All he really needs
to do is be a witness,

01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:31.550 align:middle line:84%
because everyone is responsible
for their own happiness.

01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So as the boy who sang to
the world has grown up,

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and he's no longer singing
the hopes and dreams of people

01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:41.490 align:middle line:84%
into existence, he's singing
a space that allows them

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:42.955 align:middle line:90%
to create that for themselves.

01:24:42.955 --> 01:24:49.838 align:middle line:90%
