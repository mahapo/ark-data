For Professor Michaelsson,
it's not quite that simple.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.840 align:middle line:84%
His study clearly distinguishes
between milk and fermented milk

But the claim that a lot of
milk strengthens bone, for him,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:90%
has been disputed.

for many decades from
milk-producing companies,

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:42.780 align:middle line:10%
that you get strong bones if you
consume high amounts of milk.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:48.200 align:middle line:84%

that claim is very weak.

how is that possible?

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.050 align:middle line:84%
How can milk affect
the sebaceous gland?

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.910 align:middle line:90%
It has to come from the inside.
