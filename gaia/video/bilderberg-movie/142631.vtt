00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:16.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Gentlemen, may I bid
you all welcome here,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:10%
and say one word before
I start speaking.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Eh, I am starting speaking.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is the translation
button number two is French

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:90%
and number three is English.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
You may wonder why I have
asked you to come here.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I have in mind a completely
frank and open exchange

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:90%
of views.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is insured
to you, and it

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:90%
is essential for our success.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
There is no verbatim
quotation of anybody.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:90%
And there's no press.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.137 align:middle line:84%
So you are quite free to let
yourselves go, if I may say so.

00:00:56.137 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Daniel Estulin.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm an investigative journalist.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I spent 12 years
beginning in the mid 1990s

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
until about the
year 2002, 2003 in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:90%
military counterintelligence.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Then I got burnt out.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Normal, it's what basically
happens to all of us.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:90%
We all burnt out.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I had
a lot of information

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that I had accumulated
over the years.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that would
be a good way of getting

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:90%
some of this information out.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
subjects that I thought

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
would be of interest to
the general population

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.175 align:middle line:84%
would be this very
secretive, not secret,

00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:02.966 align:middle line:84%
but secretive organization
calling themselves

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:90%
the Bilderberg Group.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.318 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.318 --> 00:02:11.808 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:11.808 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Even before I joined
the service in 1992,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Toronto in a
Spanish restaurant

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
called Segovia with a friend
of mine who was in the service,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:90%
in the KGB.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And over steak and
potato lunch, this man,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
let's just call him Vladimir.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And according to
him, Canada was going

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to be split up into
English and French

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.775 align:middle line:84%
speaking Canada through
a referendum which

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
was going to be put together
from behind the scenes

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
by these allegedly
very powerful people.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason he said that
this was going to happen

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
is that the powerful people
who ran the United States

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
needed to balance their budget.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:10%
1995 comes around, that's
three years into the future.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, all these
characters, all these people,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:10%
all these politicians
that I've never heard of

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:10%
begin to appear front and center
in front of television screens.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:10%
And all the things
that this man told me

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:10%
about three years earlier in
1995 were front and center.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I suddenly realized
that if the presidents

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and the prime ministers
were powerless

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84%
about the body politic itself,
about moving the events forward

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
into a certain
direction, if they were

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.264 align:middle line:84%
just bit actors playing their
part, then my question is,

00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:90%
who the hell runs the world?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a private club where
presidents, prime ministers,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
international bankers, and
generals rub shoulders.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And where the people running
the wars, the markets,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.056 align:middle line:84%
and governments say what
they never say in public.

00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:15.451 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:17.440 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.896 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the real reason for
the interference of the CIA with

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.437 align:middle line:10%
Bilderberg was
actually the Cold War.

00:06:20.437 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It was coming up at the time.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:10%
And they tried to use
all the institutes

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:10%
they could get to well, to steer
the public opinion in Europe,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:10%
and actually also in the
rest of the world where

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:10%
they had influence.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And Bilderberg was one of them.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
reason that they

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
financed Bilderberg the
first meeting, not totally,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:90%
but for a great part anyway.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> What today is called the
Bilderberg Group you could take

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
it way, way, way back to
about the period just after

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.724 align:middle line:90%
the Fourth Crusade, 1200, 1204.

00:06:58.724 --> 00:07:01.265 align:middle line:84%
And what's today is called the
Bilderberg Group or Bilderberg

00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Society, back then
already existed

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and it was called the
Venetian Black Nobility.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're absolutely
a continuation of Venice.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:10%
Because basically
you had a migration

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:10%
of the Venetian system of
oligarchical power over Europe

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:10%
into the low countries, in
fact, into the Netherlands where

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:10%
Bilderberg was really founded.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
absolute continuity

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:90%
of the Venetian system of power.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, if you do some
tracing of some of the family

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:10%
lineages, you'll find
in many instances,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:10%
the [INAUDIBLE] family for
example, migrated from Venice

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:10%
into northern Europe
and still remain

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:10%
a mainstay of the Bilderberg
oligarchical structures.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
You have a Bilderberg meeting
taking place once a year

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:90%
beginning in 1954.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:10%
The first meeting took place
at the Bilderberg hotel

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:10%
in the Netherlands.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And the host of that
conference was Prince Bernhard,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
the Dutch royal consort,
who was a card carrying

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.135 align:middle line:84%
member of the Nazi apparatus
during the Second World War

00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:11.935 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The people who actually
come to Bilderberg meetings,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.953 align:middle line:84%
they're the people who can
move forward the agenda

00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:90%
of the societies.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.131 align:middle line:10%
So you have president of
International Monetary

00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:10%
Fund, president of the World
Bank, president of the European

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Central Bank, of the
Federal Reserve Board.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:10%
You have key presidents
and prime ministers

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:10%
and all these individuals
on the political level,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:10%
also on empresarial level,
and also in the media.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:10%
And they all work together
with people in the military.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:84%
They all work together
with representatives

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:90%
of the banking cartels.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.359 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you're
a corporation,

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.608 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to control
every person in the company.

00:08:47.608 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:10%
You just need to
control one person who

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:10%
controls the policy of
the entire corporation.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:10%
You can say the same
thing about countries.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.615 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to control
the entire country.

00:08:55.615 --> 00:08:59.217 align:middle line:84%
You just need to control
enough key decision makers,

00:08:59.217 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
be it president, be
it prime minister,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.485 align:middle line:84%
be it key senators
and congressmen,

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:84%
people in the Federal Reserve,
people in European Central

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Bank, and people in the
European Commission.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:84%
You control them, and through
them you control the rest.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Every year, Bilderberg
has a gathering.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:84%
They'll bring together one
to 200 people, many of whom

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
make up the core of
the transatlantic

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:84%
financial and
political oligarchy.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:10%
And they'll bring
together a core group

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:10%
of powerful individuals,
government people, the media,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:10%
finance, and prospective
young recruits, people

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:10%
in the political realm
who are up and coming

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:10%
and who are going to be
seduced and controlled

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:10%
by these oligarchical interests.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And very often,
these meetings serve

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of a testing
ground for whether or not

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:84%
certain people will be advanced
in their political careers,

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:84%
including a number of
individuals who've been elected

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
President of the
United States have

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
been put through this kind of
Bilderberg finishing school

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The Bilderberg Conference
comprises about 130

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:10%
of the world's or Western
world's top decision makers

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.015 align:middle line:10%
from the banks and multinational
companies, the EU commission.

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.815 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming to the politicians.

00:10:20.815 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Also from WTO, IMF, World Bank.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, leading
politicians from the US,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Canada, eurozone, and the UK.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think though
they were clearly

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:84%
discussing some of the
biggest issues confronting

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
the Western economies
at this time,

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
why have we had no statement
either from the Prime Minister

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
or from the
Chancellor, or indeed

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
from the Minister without
portfolio, all of whom

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
attended in an
official capacity.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.050 align:middle line:84%

The key point on the
Bilderberg meeting agenda

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:84%
was the oil shock of 1973,
the 400% targeted increase

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
in the price of OPEC
oil in the near future.

in fact the hoax of 1973
continuing into the late 1970s,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and the whole point of the oil
shock was to create a nominal

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
flow of money into the hands
of the Saudis and other Persian

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Gulf wealthy nations.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
The oil hoax ultimately
created an enormous volume

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:84%
of wealth transfer nominally
into the OPEC countries,

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.990 align:middle line:90%
the so-called petrodollars.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%

right to London and Wall Street

to be managed.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So the financial oligarchy
and its major centers

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
used the oil hoax to establish
an absolute domination

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.625 align:middle line:84%
If you extrapolate that into the
near future, in one generation

00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go to
about 10 million people.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.149 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
go to 14, 18, 21.

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get
to the point, we're

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
always going to
have enough space,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
because seven billion people
space-wise is not a lot.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:90%
But we are running out of food.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And we are running out of water.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're running out
of natural resources.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.434 align:middle line:84%
So for the elitists, for the
Rockefellers of this world

00:22:39.434 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to survive-- and
I say Rockefeller

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:84%
not because he's important,
but because he is well-known.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
He is popular, which is not
the same as being important.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
For the Rockefellers of this
world to survive, most of us

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:90%
have to die.

>> It's not really the
idea of capitalism.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end, what
these people have or are,

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:84%
they already control
90% of the planet.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:10%
Every aspect of society,
everything you eat,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:10%
everything you look at,
everything you touch,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:10%
mostly is in the private hands
of these billionaires today.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is again,
you know, the whole idea

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
of de-industrializing the
world, it's a gradual process.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
You could do it, you
know, via armed conflict,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's costly, and
it's also dangerous.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you can take
everything off the chess board,

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.165 align:middle line:90%
them and you at the same time.

00:24:34.165 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, if
you can do it gradually,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:84%
started dismantling, you
know, the different service

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
industries, in different
sectors of society,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:90%
before long you have a Detroit.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.385 align:middle line:84%
And before long
you have a Greece.

00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And before long you
have Spain, which

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
is 70% population or
unemployment for kids under 30.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is reality.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:90%
This is how it's done.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a gradual process of
de-industrialization, demand

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.480 align:middle line:90%
destruction, and zero growth.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you talk
about zero growth,

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
the whole concept itself
came out of the 1972 study

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:84%
put together by
the Club of Rome.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Role of the Club of Rome
back in the 1970s was to try

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:10%
to popularize the big lie
that man could not continue

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:10%
to develop because resources
were supposedly limited.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And they used a ridiculous
modernized version

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:84%
of the old argument of
Malthus and Aristotle

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to simply state that based
on mathematical equations,

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:90%
we would exhaust the resources.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:84%

and look what we have today.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:90%
We have a Detroit.

In another 40 years
into the future

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
we have the entire world, which
is going to look like Detroit.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And Detroit is going
to look like paradise.

I know a hidden place up in

>> Well yes, there
was another reason.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the
bailout was a scam, a fraud.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It was under the guise of saving
banking institutions, which

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:90%
they saved temporarily.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
They were effectively taking
unpayable debt, huge quantities

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:84%
of unpayable debt,
and transferring it

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
from private corporations
to governments.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
This didn't make the
debt any more payable.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
They basically absorbed
huge quantities

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:84%
of worthless paper,
speculative, derivative paper,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
which could not be paid off
in any period of time anyway.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.200 align:middle line:84%
i.e., the governments
became bankrupt.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Now you see this in Europe
over the last years.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Where each country
is being forced

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.600 align:middle line:84%
to do the same thing
that was done in the US,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:84%
take on the massive
debts of these banks.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And effectively,
leaving them bankrupt.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
What you have is the growth
of corporate dictatorships

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:84%
under the banking
institutions that

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:84%
run the governments--
corporate fascism.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you see
the world increasingly

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:84%
coming under the control of
corporate fascist governments

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
under the control of the
banking institutions.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, if you kind of
go back in history 6,000 years

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
or so, and you look at who
controlled society 6,000 years

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.300 align:middle line:84%
ago in ancient Egypt,
this weren't the pharaohs.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:84%
The high priests basically gave
us knowledge one little droplet

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Just enough knowledge for
us to survive and get by,

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:90%
as we do today.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Just enough for us to
get by day to day to day

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to day with what meager
salaries we earn.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Now so on the one
hand, what you had back

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:84%
then you had the
high priest giving us

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:90%
these droplets of knowledge.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
in the last 6,000 years,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.025 align:middle line:84%
especially now, with
technological revolution,

00:28:53.025 --> 00:28:56.670 align:middle line:84%
with information revolution
and information technology,

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.090 align:middle line:84%
people have computers and
have access to internet.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all
this information,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.980 align:middle line:84%
which for thousands
of years which

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
was only available to
secret societies and very

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.620 align:middle line:84%
private organizations who
passed it on from generation

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.430 align:middle line:84%
to generation in very small,
you know, tightly knit groups

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes, you know,
underground grandfather

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
to father, father to son,
son to grandson, grandson

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:90%
to great grandson, etc.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, 99% of that information
is available through Google.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And anybody sitting in the
middle of an Amazon rain forest

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
with a computer, a laptop,
an internet connection almost

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
has the same access to
the information which

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:84%
the secret societies have
tried to protect or hide

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:90%
from us for thousands of years.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So the dilemma for
them is what do we do?

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we must
have the upper hand.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand, what
you're seeing right now

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.210 align:middle line:84%
is they're destroying the
world's economy on purpose.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Because again, progress
and development

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.112 align:middle line:84%
is directly proportional
to population density.

00:29:59.112 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
technology, you have more.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.560 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have technology,
if you can destroy technology

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:84%
on purpose, if you go to zero
growth, de-industrialization,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:84%
demand destruction,
there is going

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.031 align:middle line:84%
to get to a point in the
development of society

00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
where you're not going
to have enough technology

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
to support this rapid
population growth

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and the base of population
is going to collapse.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the primary goal
is to defend the status

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:34.430 align:middle line:84%

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:84%

first strike.

to be a superior species.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And they want to keep the
rest of the population

deliberately
backward and stupid.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is why they promote
such banal entertainment, which

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.525 align:middle line:84%
is only aimed that
people stop to think.

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:90%

exists, and will persist.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:84%
We must never let the
weight of this combination

endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:84%
We should take
nothing for granted.

Only an alert and
knowledgeable citizenry

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.190 align:middle line:84%
can compel the proper meshing
of the huge industrial and

military machinery of defense
with our peaceful methods

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%

affiliated megacorporations

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.950 align:middle line:84%
form an integral part of
the United States security

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.240 align:middle line:90%
apparatus.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Behind these technologies,
enormous streams of capital

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:84%
are being expended,
and more importantly

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.200 align:middle line:90%
invested behind the scenes.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we're at a point
where that entire system is

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.170 align:middle line:84%
at a breaking point where
it's hopelessly bankrupt.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.320 align:middle line:90%
The debt is impossible to pay.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The derivatives, which
are purely speculative,

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:84%
unregulated, gambling
bets on top of the debt

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:84%
bubble itself is
estimated at one

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:90%
and a half quadrillion dollars.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Which is a multiplier of
even the most optimistic idea

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:84%
of global GDP that's
completely off the charts.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:90%
So this entire system is doomed.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're quite
frankly at a point

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:84%
now where it would be no
surprise if on any given day

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:84%
you woke up and found out
that the entire transatlantic

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:84%
financial system
had just evaporated.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people think that
the British Empire no longer

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.090 align:middle line:90%
But this is an illusion.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Just ask yourself,
why is it that

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:84%
after the big financial
crash of 2007,

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.990 align:middle line:84%
2008 there was
absolutely nothing

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
done by the G20 or anybody
else to re-regulate the banking

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.870 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And they kept
quantitative easing.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:84%
They kept zero
interest rate policy,

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
which is really expropriating
the majority of the population.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, we are in front of an
even bigger crash than 2008.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are no so
called tools anymore

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:90%
to do anything about it.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So the reason is that
the oligarchy controls

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:90%
what is called globalization.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And globalization is really only
another word, another notion

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:90%
for the British Empire.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It is the combination of
central banks, investment banks,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:84%
hedge funds, private
equity funds, insurance,

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and reinsurance
firms who control

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
what is generally called
the global financial system.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:23.174 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, the EU is only
the continental sub-entity

00:34:23.174 --> 00:34:23.974 align:middle line:90%
of that Empire.

00:34:23.974 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the British Empire
knows that in the long run it

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
cannot survive in a world
which is based on science

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:90%
and technology and development.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, their policy is
to stop that kind of technology

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:90%
and develop.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
target nation states.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for
instance, that they

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.340 align:middle line:84%
are adamant against the BRICS
and the emergence of the BRICS.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.146 align:middle line:84%
Which is nations which
have the strength

00:34:58.146 --> 00:34:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and the power and
the commitment,

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and the mission to
building nations

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:90%
through science and technology.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.150 align:middle line:84%
That has to be
stopped in their view.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, their
target is the idea

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:90%
of the nation state itself.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Destroy nation states in
order to preserve and maintain

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.500 align:middle line:90%
the power of the Empire.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There is absolutely a
plan to depopulate the world.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And you simply have to listen to
or read the writings of people

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:84%
like Prince Philip
of Great Britain who

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.870 align:middle line:84%
has stated explicitly
that we should reduce

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:84%
the population of the world
from seven billion people down

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:90%
to one billion.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.910 align:middle line:84%
He has stated very
charmingly that he

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.420 align:middle line:84%
would like to be
reincarnated as a virus

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.700 align:middle line:84%
to try to reduce the
world's population.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:90%


00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> If you kind of
play with the numbers,

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.450 align:middle line:84%
you realize that I've had almost
seven million people have read

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:90%
my book.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe another 20,
30 million people

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.250 align:middle line:90%
are aware of what Bilderberg is.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But my question is, how
many millions of people

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:90%
watch the Oscars?

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:84%
How many millions of people
watch the Super Bowl?

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.410 align:middle line:84%
How many hundreds of millions
of people watch, you know,

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.804 align:middle line:90%
the finale of the Big Brother?

00:36:17.804 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that when
you play with the numbers,

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:84%
you realize it's easy to
sway people's attentions.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:10%
And also, because of
everything we've been taught

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:10%
and how we've been taught
to behave as people, media,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.104 align:middle line:10%
which forms part
of this conspiracy,

00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:10%
they've been able to
convince the people

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:39.350 align:middle line:10%
that unless something is on
the cover of The New York

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:10%
Times, the Washington Post,
Le Monde, The Economist, Wall

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Street Journal,
it doesn't exist.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Which is why so many
times people say

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
to me, if what you say is
true and it is shocking,

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.060 align:middle line:84%
why is it not on the cover
of "The New York Times?"

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Because again, "The New York
Times" of this world, they

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.040 align:middle line:84%
form part of the
Bilderberg organization.

to tell the truth,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.310 align:middle line:84%
but to sell a particular
vision of reality,

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:84%
which the elitists need to
move their agenda forward.

And actually from
what we're hearing,

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.520 align:middle line:84%
it's actually gone over to
almost eight kilometers.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.600 align:middle line:84%

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.950 align:middle line:84%
a new paradigm in which
we organized our business

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:54.450 align:middle line:84%
as human beings based on the
concept of man's morality,

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.850 align:middle line:90%
creativity, and free will.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:01.020 align:middle line:84%
We cannot have a situation
where, as in Greece,

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.470 align:middle line:90%
60% of the youth have no jobs.

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.870 align:middle line:84%
That is killing the
future of society.

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Or Spain, where it
is almost at 60%.

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
That is killing
the future if youth

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:84%
don't have a mission and
a purpose to fulfill.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost halfway through
the second decade of the 21st

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:24.580 align:middle line:84%
century, I ask myself
something over and over again,

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:28.080 align:middle line:84%
making an attempt to understand
what is happening to us.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going as nations?

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:31.950 align:middle line:90%
As a world?

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.410 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to us
if the Bilderberg Group

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and their cohorts finally win?

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:40.270 align:middle line:84%
What is the destiny
of the human race?

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:43.667 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean to be mortal?

00:54:43.667 --> 00:54:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very
interesting question.

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:49.930 align:middle line:10%
Because there are two ways
of talking about immortality.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.160 align:middle line:10%
We all die.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.610 align:middle line:10%
No one so far has
discovered a method

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:58.510 align:middle line:10%
by which we can live eternally
in our biological form.

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the meaning of the
human mind and the human body

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.440 align:middle line:90%
may not be quite the same thing.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, people
like Einstein,

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:12.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, who over a century
ago defined matter, antimatter,

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:16.090 align:middle line:84%
progress, which we're
now going into today.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So some people are immortal
because of the consequences

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:21.580 align:middle line:90%
of their having existed.

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And the best we can do
as human beings, which

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:84%
no other animal
can do, is we can

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:31.300 align:middle line:84%
continue to be immortal
our participation

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.560 align:middle line:84%
in the development of
humanity and the development

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.420 align:middle line:90%
of our solar system.

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.200 align:middle line:90%
So immortality means one thing.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It means either the consequences
of your having lived,

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the benefits for mankind
of your having lived,

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:49.570 align:middle line:84%
one way or the other, as a poet
or as a scientist or whatever,

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:52.570 align:middle line:84%
you've contributed something
to the wealth of humanity.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And you are, in that
sense, immortal.

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Or you can be a poor
slug who doesn't think,

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:02.720 align:middle line:84%
who has no consequence,
no reason to exist,

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:90%
who just lives and dies.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's the choice.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.910 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I have had certain attempts
on the part of the Bilderberg

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Group back about 10 years back
where I was actually offered

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:25.650 align:middle line:84%
money to cease and
desist, go away.

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And I describe it
in one of my books.

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And as I sat there watching
this man write a check,

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I said to myself and I said
to him, help me out please.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:40.800 align:middle line:84%
How many zeros is
one's freedom worth?

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.160 align:middle line:84%
He stopped, paused, looked
at me, gave me the check,

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.670 align:middle line:84%
which I have, you know,
check, as a momento.

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Mr. Estulin,
you have a nice day.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, that even
if they do kill me once,

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I think I've done my bit
on this planet Earth.

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.905 align:middle line:84%
And I've reached a certain
level of immortality.

00:56:58.905 --> 00:57:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've done my part
to pass off the baton

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.140 align:middle line:90%
to the future generations.

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's their job to
pick it up and go with it.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:10.382 align:middle line:90%
Because again, humanity is one.

00:57:10.382 --> 00:57:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do
everything in our power

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we,
as society, achieve

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:15.920 align:middle line:90%
this immortality.

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And for me,
immortality is assuring

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:21.630 align:middle line:84%
the survival of the
species, all of the species.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And for us to happen,
for this to happen,

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.990 align:middle line:84%
we've got to make sure that
higher ideals, you know,

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:32.760 align:middle line:84%
on the general level of things,
take precedence over money,

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.060 align:middle line:90%
and even ones' personal safety.

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we can win this war.

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But the first step necessary
for actually winning

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:45.520 align:middle line:90%
is to know what the war is.

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The war is not against
merely financial interests

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.220 align:middle line:84%
or military powers
or even groups

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.160 align:middle line:84%
as powerful as the
Bilderberger Group.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It is a war against
what has been called

00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:59.200 align:middle line:90%
powers and principalities.

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a war against a concept
of man which is evil.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the concept of man that we
are nothing other than animals.

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It is an idea which says
that human beings do not

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:16.060 align:middle line:84%
have the capability
of a creative spark.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:84%
That we do not, in
fact, have free will.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.940 align:middle line:84%
That we, therefore, cannot
act morally or immorally.

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.870 align:middle line:84%
We just simply do
whatever our desires say.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is that concept of man
which finds expressions today

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.680 align:middle line:84%
in things like the
Bilderberg Group

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and in the global
financial system, which

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.880 align:middle line:84%
is based on speculation,
usury, and the destruction

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.320 align:middle line:90%
of populations.

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> We are on the crossroads.

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And the roads we take
now will determine

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.270 align:middle line:84%
whether we will live in the
21st century as nation state

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.550 align:middle line:84%
republics, or
subjugated, culled,

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.730 align:middle line:90%
and dehumanized crop of slaves.

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We are fighting
a combined effort

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.980 align:middle line:84%
of some of the most
brilliant people in history

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:04.336 align:middle line:84%
who scheme against us for the
purposes of possessing us.

00:59:04.336 --> 00:59:06.790 align:middle line:90%
But the human will is immortal.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Tyrants have killed
millions, and yet people

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:12.600 align:middle line:84%
fought and eventually
won their freedom.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Freedom stirs the human
heart, and fear stills it.

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Amidst the deafening
the cacophony

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:middle line:84%
of patriotic silence, in certain
voices command attention.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Immortality has its moral basis
in truth and incorruptibility.

00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It deserves to be given all
the support that it can get.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:35.513 align:middle line:84%
It deserves to be
fought and died for.
