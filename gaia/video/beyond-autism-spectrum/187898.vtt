00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he should be
speaking well by that time,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't get
any better later on.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:84%
They lose the ability to
speak and lose those skills.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
If he doesn't develop
the first words,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
then nothing else really
happens after that.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm really pushing
to do whatever

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:84%
we can to get him to
say his first words.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, then, for
me, then I'll be like OK,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:90%
it's started.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But right now with Oskar,
with him not saying anything,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm still really like--

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I do question Carly
quite a bit, saying like,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:90%
is this where Teddy was at?

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I came into his life
when he was older,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:90%
so he was already speaking.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We're looking
at your book, Ted.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:90%
So-- that you did.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to want
to live in Mexico.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Bayfield,
on the Great Lakes,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I said Mexico is
on the other side.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not true.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> But it wasn't actually there?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's actually Michigan.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Ted was-- well, he was
officially diagnosed as being

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:84%
on the autism
spectrum at 18 months.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
When I compare the two of
them, their verbal skills

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:90%
are probably the same.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And every time he'd say a sound,
then we would get all excited.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he claps
after he made the sound.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:90%
[BABBLING]

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.085 align:middle line:84%
You know, at this point he
could maybe say letters,

00:10:05.085 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
but he wouldn't be able
to tell you his name.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this is before my time.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's things that I
recognize in Teddy's behavior,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
but there's certain things
that I have never seen at all.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Teddy.

00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.442 align:middle line:90%
I-- I--

00:10:31.442 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Want.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:90%
I want.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I want juice.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent!

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Juice?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I want juice.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I want juice.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:03.875 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> To have it
happen again, right?

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I sit there, and I think, God,
what the hell did I do wrong,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and why didn't I see it at,
like, six months, like right

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I can see
Izzy in the hospital,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and she was making eye
contact with me then,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
locking eyes with
me, like days old.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And Oskar was always looking
at stuff, or just sleeping.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:90%
He slept all the time.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So I was really frustrated at
myself, because I was like,

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:90%
there it was, black and white.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We just kept saying, oh, well,
she's the girl, he's the boy.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And she's the happy twin,
and he's the sad twin.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Oskar, look.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd go to the computer, and
it was left at a page where

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:90%
early signs of autism.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, because
I was like, no.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said, just calm down.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought you
were being over-anxious.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.148 align:middle line:90%
And so when it did--

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Negative and stuff.

00:11:56.065 --> 00:11:57.565 align:middle line:84%
You thought I was
being pessimistic.

00:11:57.565 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You said, well, I
did this checklist,

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and you should do it, and you
should see what you think.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.203 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, sure,
I'll do the checklist.

00:12:03.203 --> 00:12:05.882 align:middle line:84%
And then I started going
through, and I was like, shit.

00:12:05.882 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:90%
No, he doesn't do that.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:90%
No, he doesn't do that.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't do that.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, yeah, you really
get pissed off, you know?

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I was-- then I was
like, yeah, I didn't want to--

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:90%
we didn't wanna do that.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:90%
That's not where-- we did not.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:90%
We were done with it.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's a
bit disheartening,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
when you get through
it all and then,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.697 align:middle line:84%
wow, we're in the
same boat again.

00:12:27.697 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> 17.5% off everything.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Except gift cards.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we had such
good success with Teddy,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and we've kind of
been through it,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm really hoping that we can
get the same kind of results

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:90%
with Oskar.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Oskar's laughing
at the shadows.

00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:55.582 align:middle line:90%
Oskar.

00:12:55.582 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> With Oskar, he just is
so back there right now that

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure him out is--

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where the
starting point is with him.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I really don't like
the spitting thing.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Why are we doing that?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I really don't
want him to do it,

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's just
massively hard.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.513 align:middle line:90%
It's just really hard.

00:13:50.513 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, he does seem
to do it when he stressed,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:90%
or when he's really excited.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Ew, that was gross.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't want to do the IBI,
because basically we don't want

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of the behaviors,
because the behaviors are

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%
a clue to what's really wrong.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.115 align:middle line:84%
>> With an IBI session, you
look at the behaviors that you

00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
don't want the
child to be doing,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:90%
which is often his stimming.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:29.023 align:middle line:84%
And then you're trying to
push him to be typical.

00:14:29.023 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want you
to do, and then you'll

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:90%
be rewarded when you do it.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work if he's stimming
for a particular reason.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, when we finally
did IBI with Teddy, like--

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they pushed
him really far.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> He was almost five.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:84%
He was like 4 and
3/4, and he was still

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:90%
eating pureed food, baby food.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Put the whole piece in.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Not in the side.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Those were like
pears, like canned pears.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
He had this hypersensitivity
to textures,

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
which for him, anything larger
than a crumb was torture.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So I told him to use his
big teeth on the sides,

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
but he couldn't move the
food around in his mouth.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> With his tongue.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.838 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:90%
[HOWLING]

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Chew some more.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It was partly psychological
and partly his sensitivity.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
For him, it always felt like
you had put a ton of food

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:90%
in his mouth.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>> 3, 2, 1.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> My goal with the
IBI was his feeding.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.735 align:middle line:84%
That was what I still
couldn't seem to do by myself.

00:15:42.735 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.348 align:middle line:84%
When he was not doing
what he was asked,

00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and this is myself
and the therapist,

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:84%
because we were
doing it together,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
then we were just
supposed to point,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
directing him to
sit at the table.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we were supposed
to even not look at him.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's in a full
on meltdown, and he's

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
kicking us and yelling and
crying and just inconsolable.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this could go on
for an hour, hour and a half.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And we were just supposed
to try to almost corral him

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:84%
closer to the table, so then you
could say that was a success.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:90%
He got to the table.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, did he?

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Did he go willingly?

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I said,
I'm not doing this anymore.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
We haven't
accomplished anything.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Like everything that
we do as autistics,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
it's all got a reason behind
it, and it's all either reducing

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:84%
pain or stress, or expressing
something that we don't have

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:90%
another way to express.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's better.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just really very
thankful that, in the end,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
we did have a couple
really good therapists.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
We were just gonna work on
our own and do our own thing.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
She wrote him on this
contract, just on a whim, Ted,

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:90%
what would you really--

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
she says, what would
you really wanna do?

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
What's something
that you're wanting

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to do that other-- you
know, he says "blow

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:90%
out birthday candles."

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:84%
"I, Teddy, will eat three bites
of vanilla cake if Mom makes it

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and I can blow out
candles on the cake."

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And we held onto that paper.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.818 align:middle line:84%
That was-- you
know, and he knew.

00:17:18.818 --> 00:17:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Last bite.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Remember to chew.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Chew, chew.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, seconds, seconds!

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.722 align:middle line:90%
Good job, Teddy, hurray.

00:17:32.722 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a huge difference.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
We did it in, I think,
a month and a half.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you did it.

00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Hurray!

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.865 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:17:43.865 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:90%
That was strong blowing.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It was done in a caring
way, that he felt then that she

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
wanted to help him, and that
she didn't wanna hurt him.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess the goal
is to really look

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
at why he's doing this
behavior, so that we

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:84%
can find something that's along
that line but is way better.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.305 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'm learning now.

00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't wanna stop his
attempts at expression.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I guess, in a way
he's doing something

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:90%
there that he's enjoying.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
a calming thing,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:84%
or if it's just
something that for him

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is stimulating,
like to his eyes,

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
if he sees the
shadows or the light.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You hear about other people
on the spectrum that had

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:90%
the same interest in light.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, even
in the beginning,

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
right, when he would
look at an object,

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
he'd always look at it
really close and turn it.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.338 align:middle line:84%
So depending on what they're
really interested in,

00:19:00.338 --> 00:19:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and which might again
look like a behavior,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
could be what is their interest
and therefore their gift.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> These are some of
my unfinished programs.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>> How many lines of code?

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Did you make it to a thousand?

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Read bed.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I am in bed.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Red, Ned, Ted, and Ed in bed.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Ted.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, how's Ned?

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> We just got a letter.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%
We just got a letter.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:90%
We just got a letter.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.666 align:middle line:90%
Wonder who it's from.

00:19:32.666 --> 00:19:34.498 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:19:34.498 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Oskar.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oskar.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Good job, Izzy.

00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:39.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah!

00:19:39.312 --> 00:19:40.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Good job.

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay!

00:19:41.937 --> 00:19:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We call it super snack.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We figure it's better
than saying bad medicine.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
The idea behind it is to get
basically all the supplements

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and vitamins, all
the things that are

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:90%
kind of hard to get into them.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So we put it all together
in one super snack.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Now you gotta watch that certain
things you can't give together.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're still very
optimistic that we can

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:90%
work on reversing the effects.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.528 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.528 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When Ted was not quite four,
we took him to see a naturopath

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that specialized in
kids with autism.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And with that, we
changed his diet.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We added supplements
to his diet,

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and we also started
doing B12 shots with him.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> He improved so much during
that point that it changed his

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.550 align:middle line:84%
behaviors and his learning
and his speech and everything.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We saw a huge
burst in his words,

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:90%
and he sort of lost that fog.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.143 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.143 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We have more microbes living
in our guts than there are

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:90%
people on the planet.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
We actually have more microbial
cells that live in our bodies

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
than we have human cells that
make up parts of our bodies.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.707 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
is really fascinating,

00:21:06.707 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:84%
that is really just
coming to the fore

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is that microbes, especially
the microbes in the gut,

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.490 align:middle line:84%
seem to communicate
with the brain.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It may actually be possible
to change those microbes in

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:90%
and the way that they behave.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest way of
doing it is through diet.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
The microbes may actually
be responding to the foods

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that you give them and changing
the way that they actually

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
metabolize, changing
the way that you think

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and the way that you behave.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's many, many
reports from parents,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.280 align:middle line:84%
from doctors of children
who are treating autism,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that show that dietary
intervention can actually

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:90%
be very helpful.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we're also looking
at trying a grain-free,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:90%
legumes-free diet.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.815 align:middle line:84%
Wondering if we should
avoid all sweeteners.

00:21:49.815 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we've
got to be careful.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> About how much.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But the big focus is going
to be on the B12 injections.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, so there's his blood.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of his red
cells, these circles,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:90%
have this white in the center.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.605 align:middle line:84%
>> And those cells don't
have enough oxygen.

00:22:10.605 --> 00:22:11.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:22:11.405 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So could be for
a number of reasons.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Could be if he's a little
bit anemic, low in iron.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the B vitamins
could be an issue, too.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and he doesn't like
to eat meat, to be hon-- well,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:90%
some he does.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.855 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to get
the meat into him.

00:22:25.855 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And then this, is it weird
that they have points on them?

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The points, yeah.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Because that's an indication
of digestion issue.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Leaky gut.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have some
signs of the yeast.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I see a fair few those
yeast markers in there,

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:90%
and the leaky intestines.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:84%
That's where probiotics
can help with healing that,

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and also with
digesting the food.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.635 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm more really hoping
for a medical solution.

00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really hoping that
the diet change and we're

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.093 align:middle line:84%
doing the vitamin B12 shots
and all these kind of things

00:23:00.093 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to see a
real change in his ability

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.608 align:middle line:84%
to just interact with
the world around him.

00:23:08.608 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, we're still
gonna have to work with him,

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
but I'm hoping it
won't be as much.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I think he still has a chance
now of catching up to Izzy.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The spoon.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, if he
does start to catch up,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:90%
she can really pull him along.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Circle.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Circle, yeah.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Star?

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It kind of looks
like a star or a sun.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.465 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:34.465 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Horse.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it the horse?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.225 align:middle line:90%
You wanna move my hand?

00:23:38.225 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Horse, horse, horse.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Where?

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.484 align:middle line:84%
Is it the horse, or
it's on the farm?

00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Horse!

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> My hand, do you
wanna move my hand?

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.764 align:middle line:84%
Because the one time he did move
my hand onto the one character.

00:23:49.764 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Which one?

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.740 align:middle line:90%
This?

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:90%
This?

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:90%
The horses?

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.343 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.343 --> 00:24:08.143 align:middle line:90%
Planes.

00:24:08.143 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:90%
You all done?

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.125 align:middle line:90%
OK, see you later.

00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And just as it
started, it's over.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
He seems to really look
intently at these characters.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.910 align:middle line:90%
But at the horse as well.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just gonna be interesting.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I know the kids
make these big leaps,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and then they plateau, and big
leaps, and then they plateau.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I just want a big
leap, and not this

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:90%
be a whole year of plateauing.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And I do like tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like
this is our moment

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.684 align:middle line:90%
to make those leaps with him.

00:24:50.684 --> 00:24:53.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:53.648 --> 00:24:55.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Bubbles.

00:24:55.624 --> 00:24:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Bubbles.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We knew we wanted to
start a play-based therapy.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And the first step was to
create a level of trust

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.179 align:middle line:84%
with him, so that he would
want to play with us.

00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:10.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at them all.

00:25:10.012 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Look it.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> When we were working
with Ted in the States,

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:84%
we were actually even
following a play-based therapy.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready.

00:25:18.594 --> 00:25:20.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Set.

00:25:20.904 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Set.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Go!

00:25:23.216 --> 00:25:24.016 align:middle line:90%
>> There we go.

00:25:24.016 --> 00:25:27.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent!

00:25:27.597 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know what's funnier,
his reaction or watching

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:90%
your dad.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> See, this part of the play
therapy is the good part,

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Like you're playing
a game with him,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.562 align:middle line:84%
but you're still trying to get
him to use the words, right?

00:25:42.562 --> 00:25:43.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready.

00:25:43.494 --> 00:25:47.124 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.124 --> 00:25:48.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Set.

00:25:48.567 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Go!

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, hold on.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So this more of what we
wanna do with Oskar right now.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
we wanted to make

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Oskar feel like he
had a safe place

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to go when he was anxious,
so he could regulate himself

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.143 align:middle line:90%
by coming to us.

00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Squish.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we could build
in the communication.

00:26:24.254 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Squish.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Waiting for him to move
his head from side to side,

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:90%
this is an earlier video.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So at this point,
we're just using that

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:90%
as his form of communication.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
If he moves his head, we
squish him in the pillow again.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Squish!

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Wee!

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we're to the point
where I can actually give him

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:90%
the verbal cue of "more."

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> More.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And then once he
turns and looks at me,

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.498 align:middle line:90%
I will begin again.

00:26:56.498 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> More!

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the start
of communication,

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
where I'm asking him something,
and waiting for his response.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.841 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:08.773 align:middle line:90%
>> There's Izzy.

00:27:08.773 --> 00:27:10.705 align:middle line:90%
That's Izzy!

00:27:10.705 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:90%
[SCREAMING]

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You're never ready for
having a kid with special needs.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you always
hope for the best

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:90%
when you're expecting them.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.312 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, you
wanna make sure.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things we
need to do with him right now.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, there's
four other ones, right?

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you can't
put one over the other,

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
but in some WAYS I mean,
you hope you don't have to.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you react when you
found out there was gonna be

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:90%
twins?

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I thought it was awesome.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
When it was twins, I
thought it was fantastic.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And I, again, didn't
realize the amount of time.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:90%
I just thought well, two?

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Two is twice as
good as one, right?

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:90%
So I just--

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:90%
You were doing it the other day.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I just probably
can never fix it.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, go on to another one.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.913 align:middle line:90%
Just try another one.

00:28:10.913 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Try a different tutorial?

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:12.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:12.665 --> 00:28:14.207 align:middle line:84%
And maybe when I
have some time, I'll

00:28:14.207 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:90%
look at it, to give you a hand.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.711 align:middle line:84%
It would be easier if some
were in school, definitely.

00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:23.480 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> When I read Temple Grandin
saying "my primary emotion is

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and has always been
fear" to me, that's Ted.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
He fears so many things, and
he is in a constant state

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.630 align:middle line:90%
of anxiety, for sure.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:42.433 align:middle line:84%
And so for him, that made
school really challenging.

00:28:42.433 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
The first school
that Ted went to,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:84%
they really valued
Ted as a person.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And they really
tried to alleviate

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
any stressful
situations that he had.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
After we moved, and he had
to start at the new school,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.045 align:middle line:84%
that's when I started
getting phone calls.

00:28:58.045 --> 00:28:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask the teacher
when they're things

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that were too stressful
for him, to let

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.320 align:middle line:90%
him do his math worksheets.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And he loved doing math,
and he loved to run.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Both of those things
helped him calm down.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But the school here
insisted that he

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.030 align:middle line:90%
follow the classroom routine.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:90%
He had to conform.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And when they did that and they
forced him to conform, in time,

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:90%
things just deteriorated.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
The way school's set up in the
time blocks really heightened

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Ted's anxiety.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Ted is a numbers kid.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:84%
He's the only four-year-old
that's watching the clock.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:84%
If he didn't pay attention,
and then also you're

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.560 align:middle line:84%
like "OK, boys and
girls, time to clean up,"

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
which is what happens normally,
he would have a meltdown.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like somebody that
has a very busy schedule.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:90%
You are obsessed with the clock.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
see the storyline that

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:84%
goes through his head,
and he gets overwhelmed,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and there's no end, and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:90%
and it just spins.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:84%
It got to the point where he was
trying to run away from school.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the last times was he
was running at recess time.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:12.248 align:middle line:84%
Ted knew the route to get
home, which wasn't safe.

00:30:12.248 --> 00:30:14.540 align:middle line:84%
That's when I decided that
we had to do something else,

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.437 align:middle line:84%
that they obviously
didn't want him there,

00:30:16.437 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know how
to deal with him,

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't trust
them with him.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.305 align:middle line:84%
That's when we said
we're just homeschooling.

00:30:23.305 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I still don't have any--

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I get it.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I got it!

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:27.142 --> 00:30:28.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's--

Just jumping in place

00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:84%
There's something
there with the visual.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.958 align:middle line:84%

still lumbers when he walks.

Like, looking around
the room and looking

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:90%
at shadows and light.

And one of the areas
where they really

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:84%
need to working on
treatments is how

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:12.130 align:middle line:84%
to deal with some of these
really bad sensory issues.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:84%
One kid may have a lot
of visual problems.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Another kid's mainly
sounds sensitive.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Another one may have both.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.505 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the ones
that remain nonverbal,

00:36:19.505 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're touching
and smelling everything.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why they do it is,

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:84%
because smelling and touching
still work, and seeing

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and hearing is a
jumbled up mess.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I had problems with receptive
speech when I was a child.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:84%
If grownups talked very
slowly to me, I understood.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But when they talked fast,
it went into gibberish.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
All of the hard consonant
sounds dropped out.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I thought grownups had a foreign
language, a special grownup

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:90%
talk.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So if I said "the dog
went down the street,"

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.635 align:middle line:84%
that might sound like
"the og ent own the eet."

00:36:56.635 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I'd be hearing.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think in children
that remain non-verbal,

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
they may still be hearing
just this garbled speech.

00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I know the other OT was
talking about that as well.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In the report I
looked at very briefly.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much play
he actually did as an infant.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Did he actually
explore his body?

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Did he grab his feet,
and pull them up,

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and put them, his
feet, in his mouth?

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Did he put his
fingers in his mouth?

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So he may not have a
very good body map.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So we were gonna go back there--

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And start at that.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And give him a good body map.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.920 align:middle line:90%
Press his feet, press his toes.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Give him a sense of where
his body is in space.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

his communication

00:38:02.708 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to be to enhance his

And new connections are
being forged or strengthened

Can you get him
having more words?

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that it's more
consistent with all the movement

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing, you
should start to see changes.

Oh, he fell down!

He's gonna be one
who's gonna need lots.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And I usually find the kids
who need lots of sensory input

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that I find
have the best therapy

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.203 align:middle line:90%
outcome, typically.

00:39:02.203 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Especially if their vestibular
system isn't working,

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.495 align:middle line:90%
because I can work on that.

00:39:05.495 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:84%
We can just give
and give and give,

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.450 align:middle line:90%
and make those systems process.

01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And he hated them for that
time, because at that point,

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
they weren't accepting him
of who he was as a whole.

01:18:10.290 --> 01:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
bothers me in a way.

01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not
what I'm feeling.

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying that some
of the effects of having autism

01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:20.540 align:middle line:90%
are really terrible.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Like a lack of being
able to communicate,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.608 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing, right?

01:18:24.608 --> 01:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, right now
Oskar's frustrated, I think,

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
because he can't
get his ideas out.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.440 align:middle line:90%
I think he's frustrated by that.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>> The way Izzy's not.

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:34.607 align:middle line:84%
He's frustrated, because
he can't communicate.

01:18:34.607 --> 01:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm frustrated because
he can't communicate.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just thinking,
if that's a cau--

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
if that's because of autism,
then I hate autism for it.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:54.530 align:middle line:90%


01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't wanna focus
on that one thing.

01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm so happy that
we can have those moments,

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.912 align:middle line:84%
where I know he's really
connecting with me,

01:19:05.912 --> 01:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
even though he's
not talking to me,

01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:08.878 align:middle line:84%
even though he's
not saying "Mommy",

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
even though he's not saying "I
love you, Mommy," or whatever,

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
he looks now in my eyes, and I
know he's recognizing my face.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.120 align:middle line:90%
He's seeing me.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.760 align:middle line:84%
He's happy, and we're
sharing a moment.

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of parenting.

01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:23.712 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
looking for as well.

01:19:23.712 --> 01:19:24.920 align:middle line:90%
You're looking for that bond.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what, I think, in
general, humans are doing.

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.140 align:middle line:90%
That's why we interact.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think we
get so stigmatized

01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that that interaction
with people

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.194 align:middle line:90%
has to be verbal communication.

01:19:40.194 --> 01:19:41.874 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

01:19:41.874 --> 01:19:42.674 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

01:19:42.674 --> 01:19:44.162 align:middle line:90%
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:19:44.162 --> 01:19:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:51.610 align:middle line:90%


01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Our seven, our
group of seven,

01:19:55.330 --> 01:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
is what is safe and what will
be with him, the kids, for sure,

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:01.890 align:middle line:90%
for the majority of his life.

01:20:01.890 --> 01:20:06.345 align:middle line:90%


01:20:06.345 --> 01:20:07.840 align:middle line:90%
[BABBLING]

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Though I thought he was
gonna have more words,

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and he'd be communicating
with us verbally,

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the year,
that's so far down

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
in the line of what's
really important.

01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And that trust and respect
and caring, safe environment,

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
of connecting, that
intimacy with the people

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
that really care about you
is, I think, what we just

01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.580 align:middle line:90%
spent the last year doing.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:38.791 align:middle line:90%


01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:39.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay!

01:20:39.757 --> 01:20:44.130 align:middle line:90%


01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo!

01:20:46.047 --> 01:20:47.130 align:middle line:90%
what about the other boot?

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Can you get that one off?

01:20:49.880 --> 01:22:36.000 align:middle line:90%
