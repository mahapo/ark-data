colleagues, who would win
the race and develop the drug

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin from the
magic mushrooms.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that is very
strange that LSD is not just

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:10%
a laboratory product.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:10%
It is closely related with
this old Indian magic drug.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:10%
That means that LSD belongs
pharmacologically, chemically,

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:10%
to the group of the sacred
magic plants of Mexico.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:10%
It's a very important finding.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Wasson was friends
with Henry Boothe Luce,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
who was the publisher
of "Life Magazine."

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
He told his friend Luce
about his experience,

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and Luce encouraged him
to write up his account.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.350 align:middle line:84%
That was really the first word
out to Western civilization

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that psychedelic mushrooms
indeed existed at all.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:10%
And it really stimulated
growing interest

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:10%
and led to the psychedelic
explosion of the '60s.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Wasson's influence became due
in large part to an enigmatic

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Harvard psychologist
named Timothy Leary.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Though he became known as the
most dangerous man in America,

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:84%
he might have been described
by others in the year 1960

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
as a New England square,
a hard-drinking Irishman,

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
or by himself, an atheist
psychologist in the midst

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of a midlife crisis.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:84%

very prominent researcher

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:90%
at Harvard.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%

is still being used today.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:10%
He was sort of a pied piper.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> During his early
years at Harvard,

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Leary was in the throes
of personal crisis.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
His first wife had committed
suicide on his 35th birthday,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
reportedly after a
strained open marriage.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It was during this time
that he described himself

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:84%
as an anonymous
institutional employee who

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
drove to work each morning in
a long line of commuter cars

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and drove home each
night and drank Martinis,

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:84%
like several million
middle-class,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:90%
liberal, intellectual robots.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Inspired by Wasson's article,
Leary traveled down to Mexico

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:84%
with a colleague in
1960 who had found

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:84%
some mushrooms from a
curandero in the mountains.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Leary later said
that he learned more

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:84%
about the brain and
its possibilities,

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and more about psychology,
in the five hours

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
after taking the mushrooms
than he had in the preceding 15

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
years of studying and doing
research in psychology.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:10%
>> When he got back to Harvard,
he got permission to do

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:10%
research with psilocybin.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was the beginning of
the Harvard Psilocybin Research

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:10%
And that was really
the beginning

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.210 align:middle line:10%
of formal research,

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.527 align:middle line:10%

research products that could go

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to the Harvard Psilocybin
Research Program.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a Good Friday
study with Walter Pahnke.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:10%
It was a remarkable
study and groundbreaking.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
They had given
psilocybin and a placebo

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to 20 graduate
students in theology,

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
comparing their experiences to
genuine mystical experiences

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
nine out of the 20 people
had a mystical experience.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And eight out of those
nine had the psilocybin.

these medicines,
these sacraments,

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
can produce an experience that
was found throughout millennia

a kind of nervous--

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:10%
I was going to say
nervous breakdown,

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:10%
but it was actually
positive for him.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:10%
So he was so blown away by
this spiritual experience

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:10%
he was having that he kind
of ran out of the chapel.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.898 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to
run to the, I think,

00:21:59.898 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
the dean or the president's
office to proclaim everything

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:90%
that he had learned.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And behaved rather bizarrely
out in public until the sitters

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
found him and retrieved
him and brought him back.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And he actually had to be
sedated with a tranquilizer.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%

interesting piece of history

psychoactive effects of LSD,

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:10%
they also observed that it
deepens sort of introspective

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:10%
insight and can be
used in psychotherapy.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's a really unique
history in the area of drug

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:10%
research in that there was a
heyday of psychedelic research

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:10%
extending from the 1950s

write Sandoz to get a sample

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:90%
clinically.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It was legal and available.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And that really began
the big experiment

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:84%

close to 30 years.

all the tests and

of LSD in the five-man
ward, together.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Then, the third Monday,
we give them a larger dose

individually and have
each one of them cared

for by one of these teams.

during the course of what

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:84%

had a psychospiritual epiphany,

I didn't know why
then, but Dr. Koren

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
kept urging me to find out
why I was fighting this.

I wanted love.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the thing
that was probably my biggest

everybody was forcing it on me,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:10%
many lifetimes at many levels
of consciousness beyond

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:10%
the physical.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that,
in the future,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:84%
there will be
centers where people

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:84%
will be able to go to prepare
people for any kind of turning

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
point or crisis in their
life, such as along the lines

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.550 align:middle line:84%
of the incredible
powerful research

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that Stan Grof and Walter Pahnke
did at Spring Grove Hospital

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:90%
with terminal cancer patients.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a mental institution,
Spring Grove State Hospital

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:90%
in Baltimore.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It is one of four places
in the country where

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
research on LSD
treatment continues

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:90%
under federal sponsorship.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
The tablets in Ott's hand each
contain a microscopic trace

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:90%
of LSD.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
To an observer, the atmosphere
seems closer to faith healing

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:90%
than medicine.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So the way in which they
really refined the approach is

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that they used a two-person
team, often a male-female.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:10%
They pioneered eight-hour
therapy sessions, sometimes

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:10%
even longer.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It was this very expressive,
supportive environment.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.440 align:middle line:10%
>> It isn't so much the drug
as the drug in the context

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:10%
in which it's used,
the expectations,

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:10%
how the person is held
safely while they're under

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:10%
the influence of it, and the
interpretation that's made

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:10%
afterwards.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I was here under LSD.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
This went on for a million
miles on both sides,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
an endless deep
and eternity onto.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was just one of
the fears I had buried,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and it was a fear
of being left alone.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We get very stuck in
our ways and sort of rigid

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:90%
in our thinking.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.692 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
the psychedelics do

00:27:10.692 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:10%
is they increase
cognitive flexibility.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:10%
You become less rigid in
how you think they quiet

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.140 align:middle line:10%
down the default
mode network, which

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:10%
is sort of the self-obsessed,
self-serving, how am I doing?

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Am I liked?

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:26.730 align:middle line:90%
What did I do yesterday?

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.022 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do tomorrow?

00:27:28.022 --> 00:27:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And the psychedelics sort
of quiet this narcissism

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and neuroticism and allow
other parts of the brain

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
to get more active or to
connect with each other.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel beautiful.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel squashed
with beautiful.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a really powerful,
useful experience to have.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And it can help people
out of a dark place.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If you hadn't
been prepared for it,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:84%
if you hadn't gone through
those weeks of preparation,

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:90%
would LSD have meant as much?

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If I was ill before, I would
have been ill, it seems to me,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:90%
beyond repair.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I would have been so
frightened without the guidance

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and the trust and
the preparation.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.665 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
a tragedy, horrible.

00:28:16.665 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I got interested in LSD
therapy when I was in two-year

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:84%
public health service at the
public health prison hospital

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.590 align:middle line:90%
in Lexington, Kentucky.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.170 align:middle line:84%
At that time, there was
really no good treatment

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:90%
for narcotic addiction.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Recidivism rate was
extraordinarily high.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I think people leaving Lexington
had a 90% relapse rate.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had read about the
studies with alcoholism.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought
perhaps LSD might be

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
useful to provide some lasting
change for narcotic addiction.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:84%
In looking at the
literature at that time,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:84%
it looked like
that therapists who

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:84%
had used LSD themselves got much
better results than therapists

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:90%
who had not used LSD themselves.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to do
a controlled study.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:10%
I would give LSD to a group of
narcotic addicts at Lexington

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:10%
who volunteered for the study,
without having ever taken LSD

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:10%
myself, to see what impact
that the experience might have

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:10%
on their relation
with other prisoners,

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:10%
with authority figures, with
insight about themselves.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And then, my plan was to
then take the LSD myself

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:10%
under supervision from staff at
the Addiction Research Center

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:10%
there who were
experienced with the agent

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:10%
and do a second group.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, when I
was getting ready to do that,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.930 align:middle line:84%
the company that made LSD,
Sandoz, decided to recall it.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
This was around 1965,
1966, because LSD

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.004 align:middle line:90%
had become a street drug.

00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:06.374 align:middle line:90%
[HORNS BLARING]

00:30:06.374 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:10%
>> And on streets like this,
transactions involving me take

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:10%
place all the time--

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:10%
illegal, of course, but
my tabs and caps and sugar

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.840 align:middle line:10%
cubes that dissolve in your
mind as well as your mouth

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:10%
are selling every day.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Drop a cap on me,
man, and drop out.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But watch it, because the
trip can be a trap, too.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You never know where a
ticket with me will take you.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Just as pioneers of
psychedelic research were

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
beginning to understand
its therapeutic potential,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:84%
LSD began to leak out
of the laboratory.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The two figures most
responsible for its expansion

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
into the American culture lived
on opposite ends of the country

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and were from equally
different backgrounds.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:84%
On the West Coast, Ken
Kesey was introduced to LSD

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1950s as part of
the CIA's MK-Ultra program.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> At the time, I was
training for the Olympics.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I made it to be an alternate.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>> As a wrestler?

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, as a wrestler.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:10%
I'd never been drunk on beer,
let alone done any drugs.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:10%
But this is the
American government.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I had a neighbor who
was a psychologist.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.390 align:middle line:84%
He was booked to do the
experiments that Tuesday.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:90%
He chickened out.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
He says, you want
to do them? $20.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Show up.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.020 align:middle line:90%
They gave them to me.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.963 align:middle line:84%
I did them on every Tuesday
for six or eight months.

00:31:28.963 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:84%
The government wanted
somebody to look in that room.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.270 align:middle line:84%
They said, hey, we
got a great room.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:90%
We discovered this nice room.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's get somebody to go
in there and look it over.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Kesey would go on
to write "One Flew over

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.930 align:middle line:10%
the Cuckoo's Nest" partly
based on these experiences,

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:10%
and later, to host the so-called
acid tests with the Merry

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:10%
Pranksters.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And by that time, the
government had said, OK,

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:50.303 align:middle line:90%
stop that experiment.

00:31:50.303 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:84%
All these guinea pigs that we've
sent up there into outer space,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:84%
bring them back
down, and don't ever

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.452 align:middle line:84%
let them go back up there
again, because we don't

00:31:56.452 --> 00:31:57.840 align:middle line:90%
like the look in their eyes.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I give the CIA total credit
for sponsoring and initiating

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:10%
the entire consciousness
movement counterculture events

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:10%
of the 1960s.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.580 align:middle line:84%

Coast was Timothy Leary,

the now-former
Harvard psychologist.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> He began to distribute
the drug beyond his research

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:90%
subjects.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.090 align:middle line:84%
He began to speak quite
openly to the press.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>> He signed an agreement
promising that he would not

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:84%
give it to any undergraduate
students but only to graduate

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:84%
students who were using it
for some appropriate academic

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:90%
purpose.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> And Tim Leary honestly--

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he ever met
a rule he didn't like.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And that rule
quickly was broken.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:84%
The Harvard
Administration found out

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:90%
and summarily dismissed him.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And he became the apostle
preaching the religion

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.310 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic drugs.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> We teach the science
and art of ecstasy.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:84%
We teach people how
to turn on or how

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:90%
to go out of their minds.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:10%
By turn on, we
mean tune in to get

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.960 align:middle line:10%
beyond your routine
ways of thinking

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:10%
and acting and experiencing.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:10%
We often say that we're teaching
people how to use their head.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.377 align:middle line:84%
The point is that in
order to use your head,

00:33:17.377 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
you have to go out of your mind.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:84%

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.435 align:middle line:84%
were your feelings, as the
chemist who had created this?

00:33:35.435 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:10%
>> I was quite astonished,
because when I had discovered

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.900 align:middle line:10%
these very deep effects of LSD,
never would I have believed

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.657 align:middle line:10%
that it would be a pleasure
drug on the street--

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:47.740 align:middle line:10%
never would have believed.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:10%
The indians believe that you
should take the mushrooms

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:10%
only if you are prepared.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:10%
And then only do the
mushrooms bring you

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.690 align:middle line:10%
in contact with the gods.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:02.770 align:middle line:10%
If you are not prepared,
then it makes you crazy,

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:10%
or you may even die.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.425 align:middle line:10%

And he was labeled
most dangerous man

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:26.550 align:middle line:84%
in America because of these very

maintained a rather harsh view

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:90%
of Leary.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:84%

of psychedelic

We shouldn't lose
sight of the fact

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
of the degree to which
psychedelics in the culture

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
were associated with a very
vigorous antiwar movement.

was happening at the time,

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.969 align:middle line:10%

was for young people

>> In 1972, '73,
I had left school,

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and I got a job as a research
assistant in a dream research

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
study at Maimonides
Medical Center in Brooklyn.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to stay up all
night and monitor sleep EEGs.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And every time our
subject went into a dream,

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I would wake them up
over an intercom system,

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
ask them what was going
through their mind,

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:90%
and tape record the dreams.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But this also meant I had a
lot of time during the night,

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:90%
and I love to read.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the researchers
in his office, he

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.970 align:middle line:84%
had a tremendous collection
of books and articles

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:90%
on psychedelics.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:90%
And I read voraciously.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that time,
my father was very

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
concerned about what he thought
was my lack of direction.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And he had told me
that when I figure out

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.830 align:middle line:84%
what I wanted to do with
my life, I should call him.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter what time
of the day or night it was.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:90%
He wanted me to call him.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.060 align:middle line:10%
So there I was, at 2 or
3 o'clock in the morning,

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:10%
just so impressed by
what they had done.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.980 align:middle line:10%
I felt I wanted to do this also.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:10%
I woke him up from a deep
sleep, and I said, Dad,

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:10%
I figured out what I want to do.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
what's that, son?

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to
study psychedelics.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that?

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're fascinating.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:84%
There's so much we could
learn about the brain, about

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the mind-brain interface,
about mental illness.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are these
extraordinary treatment models.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And people who conventional
treatments cannot help or help

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:90%
with this model.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
son, there might

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.950 align:middle line:90%
be something to what you say.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But no one will listen
to you unless you

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:90%
get your credentials.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.860 align:middle line:84%
My personal background
really has a lot

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:49.910 align:middle line:84%
to do with Timothy Leary and the
use of psychedelics in society.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:90%
I had been born Jewish in 1953.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I was raised on stories
of the Holocaust.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, as a young
boy, I was involved

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:02.080 align:middle line:84%
in going to school during
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.090 align:middle line:84%
This idea that there
could be nuclear war

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and wipe out civilization
was also very traumatizing.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.170 align:middle line:84%
The final step for
me was Vietnam,

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was in the last
years of the lottery.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was a Vietnam War
protester, a draft resister.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I first tried
LSD in '71, but I

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:90%
had a very difficult time.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.682 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't really handle
my psychedelic experiences.

00:40:25.682 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I went to the guidance
counselor at my college,

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:90%
and I was so lucky.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:84%
The guidance counselor
took me seriously.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, he said that this
was an important exploration

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:90%
that I was doing.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a
book to read, which

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:84%
was a manuscript copy
of "Realms of the Human

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Unconscious, Observations from
LSD Research," by Stan Grof.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.610 align:middle line:84%
When I read this book,
everything fell into place

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I saw this therapeutic
use and also

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.250 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual aspects of it.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And I felt, OK,
this is a response

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.010 align:middle line:90%
to the craziness of the world.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems to me that
since the French Revolution

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.080 align:middle line:10%
and the Enlightenment,
man was put at the center

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.670 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And certain difficult
notions of God,

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:84%
on which one was
dependent, were put aside.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And that notion of man being
at the center of the universe

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.020 align:middle line:84%
led to the industrial society
that we have around us, led

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.240 align:middle line:90%
to a great deal of energy.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And the LSD experience
and what we've

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:84%
been through in the
'60s has brought us

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.010 align:middle line:84%
to a whole new
philosophy, that man

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:84%
is not the center
of the universe,

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.735 align:middle line:84%
that we're simply the
transformative energies,

00:41:34.735 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and that we live in a
sort of cosmic ecology

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:90%
for which we're responsible.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is, to my mind,
the great challenge that's

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in front of us, to
take the consciousness

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and the individual
headspace that we've all

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:54.950 align:middle line:84%
managed to develop and now
begin asking ourselves,

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.280 align:middle line:84%
what is it all for,
and how can we use it?

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We're now in what you can
consider a second renaissance

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic research.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.500 align:middle line:10%
There are a handful of centers
in the US, universities

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:10%
that are conducting
research studies.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Probably the reinitiation
of psychedelic research,

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I would really credit
Rick Strassmann.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick Strassmann had been one
of the doctors that I'd worked

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that he would
submit a protocol for DMT,

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:84%
looking at it as potential
cause of schizophrenia.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> A psychotomimetic model, so
it means mimicking psychosis.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a way for
a government agency

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to feel OK about funding
psychedelic research.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Pilot Drug Evaluation
Staff approved this study

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.250 align:middle line:90%
in 1990--

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> --and really kind of
reinitiated the field,

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.880 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And then our work
here, Roland Griffiths

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:90%
got it started not long after.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2006, the Hopkins team
set the standard for scientific

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.630 align:middle line:84%
rigor by publishing their
landmark study "A followup

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:84%
to Walter Pahnke's and
Timothy Leary's Good Friday

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.990 align:middle line:84%
experiment," concluding that
under the right setting,

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.950 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin can reliably
induce a mystical experience.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew nothing
about Johns Hopkins.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.328 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about Baltimore.

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:18.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know Roland Griffiths.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know any
of these characters.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up going to grad
school out in California where

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.490 align:middle line:84%
we were doing a study
with meditators when

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Roland's paper was published on
mystical experiences promoted

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.110 align:middle line:90%
by psilocybin.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
saying to my advisor,

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.577 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that's
where I'm going next.

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Katherine MacLean's
research on openness,

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that was a really big deal, that
study, because it was always

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:84%
thought that your personality
is your personality.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.690 align:middle line:84%
How novelty-seeking you
are and how open you are,

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:46.940 align:middle line:84%
that's just who you are, and
those things don't really

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But what the Hopkins
trials showed

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:51.980 align:middle line:84%
was that people do
become more open,

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually measure
it on a personality test.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big deal.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:59.690 align:middle line:10%
>> 70% of people were saying,
this is among the five most

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:03.090 align:middle line:10%
personally meaningful
experiences of my life.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.450 align:middle line:10%
I would ask people,
what does that mean?

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:08.090 align:middle line:10%
And someone might
say, well, gee,

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.600 align:middle line:10%
when my first child was
born, my daughter, that

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:10%
changed my life forever.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And recently, my
father passed away.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.420 align:middle line:90%
That was big.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.495 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like that.

00:44:20.495 --> 00:44:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It was around 2006, and I
had just taken over as the head

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.845 align:middle line:84%
of the Division of Alcoholism
and Drug Abuse at Bellevue.

00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:33.980 align:middle line:84%
As an addiction
psychiatrist, I'd

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.020 align:middle line:84%
always been interested
in these compounds

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
because they just seem different
from other drugs of abuse.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.965 align:middle line:84%
They didn't behave like cocaine
or amphetamine or tobacco.

00:44:41.965 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:84%
They seemed
completely different,

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.680 align:middle line:84%
yet they were labeled as
the most addictive drug.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So I always thought
that there was

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:84%
something interesting
and different about them.

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.050 align:middle line:84%
At the time, one
of my supervisors

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:52.640 align:middle line:90%
was Dr. Jeffrey Guss.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.050 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw that Albert Hofmann's
100th birthday was being

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.170 align:middle line:10%
celebrated in
Basel, Switzerland.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I must do what Huxley
wrote me in a letter.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.540 align:middle line:10%
What you take in by
vision experience

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:10%
you must give out in daily life.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.060 align:middle line:10%
And that is now the
task which I try,

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.840 align:middle line:10%
the feeling to be a part
of the universe, which

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:10%
I got by LSD experience.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:25.158 align:middle line:10%
This feeling is always
present in my life.

00:45:25.158 --> 00:45:27.200 align:middle line:10%
>> When you think about
what people thought about

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.380 align:middle line:10%
in the '60s, that LSD is
going to make you drop out

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:10%
of society, Albert Hofmann,
who discovered LSD,

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.620 align:middle line:10%
was married for 79 years, had
a career at the same company

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:41.540 align:middle line:10%
for almost his entire life,
and was an inspiration to quite

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.160 align:middle line:10%
a few of us.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of on a lark, I went
to this conference because I

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.100 align:middle line:84%
wanted to meet and see
the people that were doing

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic research.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that I
first met Charles Grob.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Administering a psychedelic
to cancer patient with anxiety

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.000 align:middle line:84%
had not occurred
since the early 1970s.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.820 align:middle line:10%
And I felt this was an
ideal patient population

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.000 align:middle line:10%
to really start off with
because the early literature was

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.180 align:middle line:10%
so impressive.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of this, from
FDA through the hospital

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:14.480 align:middle line:90%
committees, took several years.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.600 align:middle line:10%
But I was patient,
and I was persistent,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.590 align:middle line:10%
and I felt this was really
a worthy effort to make.

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, we got the
approvals we had requested.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.710 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was at NYU, I was
working at Bellevue for nine

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:30.140 align:middle line:10%
years, running the
psychiatric emergency room.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I met with the chairman at
the time, a guy named Robert

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Cancro, And I
talked to him a lot

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.750 align:middle line:84%
about what was going on
at UCLA or at Hopkins

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and saying that there was
really enough people at NYU who

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.850 align:middle line:84%
are interested that we should
try to do something in NYU.

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:47.120 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1970s, I came across
the literature on psychedelics

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.662 align:middle line:10%
and entheogens, and I also have
a long interest in palliative

00:46:49.662 --> 00:46:50.462 align:middle line:10%
care--

00:46:50.462 --> 00:46:52.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm a palliative
care psychologist--

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:55.550 align:middle line:10%
and how we die in this
country and the death anxiety.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.785 align:middle line:10%
And it felt the perfect match.

00:46:57.785 --> 00:46:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> At first, we were
just an education group.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But after meeting Charlie
Grob at UCLA, I asked him,

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.480 align:middle line:84%
so this is really
possible to do this,

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can make a
career out of this?

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.220 align:middle line:10%
And he said, yes, and
it's all about doing it

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.290 align:middle line:10%
correctly and
carefully and avoiding

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.160 align:middle line:10%
mistakes made in the past.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.920 align:middle line:90%
So we decided to do it.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:23.560 align:middle line:90%


00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.790 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Estalyn
Walcoff, and I work

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:10%
as a psychotherapist.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.910 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Dinah Bazer.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:31.590 align:middle line:10%
I teach figure skating.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:35.250 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Nick Fernandez,
and I work as a clinical

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.650 align:middle line:10%
research coordinator in
a psychiatry department

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.340 align:middle line:10%
at a hospital here in New York.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm an adult
literacy teacher,

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.950 align:middle line:10%
part-time at the public library.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I was diagnosed five years
ago with a type of lymphoma

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.800 align:middle line:90%
that was untreatable.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And not only was it untreatable,
but everybody who had had it

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.110 align:middle line:90%
had died from it.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It was aggressive.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I was diagnosed with
leukemia when I was 17 in 2004.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was during my
senior year of high school

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.880 align:middle line:84%
when I was just getting
ready to go to college.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I received the official
diagnosis in December of last

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.270 align:middle line:10%
year, so just about a year ago.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And it changed the
course of my life,

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:23.220 align:middle line:84%
because I went from being a
physically active 17-year-old

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.050 align:middle line:90%
to a cancer patient.

>> When the chemo was over, I
thought, oh, let's celebrate.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would
want to celebrate.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.303 align:middle line:84%
And when the chemo was over,
I didn't want to celebrate,

00:48:32.303 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:84%
because that's when
the fear set in.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.120 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start thinking,
when will the other shoe drop?

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:90%
When will this come back?

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Always in my life, I've
been an anxious person.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And naturally, when I
was given that diagnosis

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.140 align:middle line:90%
my anxiety shot up.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And even though years and
years and years keep going by

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still OK,
I know very well

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that this could
return at any moment.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I really went to work on
myself because I thought that

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.780 align:middle line:84%
if I were going to die much
sooner than I had planned,

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.990 align:middle line:84%
then I wanted to
understand myself better.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand
spirituality better.

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I wanted not to
have a bitter heart.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to be open.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So I did what I could
for the past five years.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And I came across a
post about this study.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I read it once,
and then I closed it.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.515 align:middle line:84%
And then I read it again, and
I said, I qualify for that.

00:49:32.515 --> 00:49:35.060 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So I traveled down to New York
City for an initial screening

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:40.630 align:middle line:90%
interview.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I traveled down to New
York City several times

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:47.350 align:middle line:84%
for psychotherapy sessions
with my two psychiatrists.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> After several sessions
of therapy and careful

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.840 align:middle line:84%

in a comfortable living room
setting under the guidance

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.800 align:middle line:90%
of their therapist team.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.080 align:middle line:84%
After a brief ritual,
they are encouraged

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to lie down on the
couch, wear eye shades,

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and listen to classical
music in order

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.940 align:middle line:90%
to create an inward experience.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Having mentioned that I had
taken psychedelics in my 20s,

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.470 align:middle line:84%
the whole object was to see
how beautiful nature was,

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:19.228 align:middle line:84%
to hear how wonderful music
was, to see what could be seen,

00:50:19.228 --> 00:50:20.520 align:middle line:90%
to touch what could be touched.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So this was very, very different
because the whole thing

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to be
experiencing was my own mind.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There was an immersion
into complete chaos,

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:45.330 align:middle line:84%
360-degree chaos, where I had no
idea of up, down, left, right.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, it was
absolutely terrifying.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I think I could
compare it to being

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:54.075 align:middle line:84%
in the hold of a ship that's
in a storm-tossed sea.

00:50:54.075 --> 00:50:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I also began experiencing
great emotional pain,

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:06.360 align:middle line:84%
in particular because I had been
listening to a Black spiritual.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.958 align:middle line:84%
I felt I could hear the
pain in that woman's voice

00:51:10.958 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:90%
who was singing the song.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And it brought to me the
whole gestalt of slavery

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and what that is to pull
people out of their homes

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and treat them like animals.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:26.595 align:middle line:84%
And I sobbed and sobbed
and sobbed because of that.

And the ability to just
be held by my mentors

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and do that greatly,
greatly relieved me.

I went into it,

the more it became evident to
me that the chaos could not

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:07.020 align:middle line:84%
maintain its magnetic draw on me
nor its strength when I stayed

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.820 align:middle line:90%
focused.

which is the most precious
thing I've ever known.

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a sense of connectedness
that runs through all of us

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that I never knew, and also
a sense of the strength of it

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and the power of it.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.770 align:middle line:84%

and beautiful clouds that were

almost like in the jigsaw
puzzle fashion that were backlit

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.830 align:middle line:90%
by a moon that I could not see.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So they were crevices of
faint light through it.

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And these eyes were
searching me out.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I felt it was a manifestation
of an alienation I had long

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.550 align:middle line:84%
carried through my
whole life that was just

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.350 align:middle line:90%

that they could find.

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.050 align:middle line:90%
I pictured it.

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this
was a hallucination.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I pictured it as
a dark mass there.

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I, like, screamed,
"Get the fuck out!"

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I will not be eaten
alive by this fear.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And once that happened,
it was just gone.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The fear was gone
and didn't come back.

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:57.390 align:middle line:90%
And it still hasn't.

coming over me,

look inside and find that I was

part of it.

I was part of everything.

00:54:28.712 --> 00:54:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I was part of God,
that you are, too.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Everything is.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can call it
whatever you want to.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't usually call it God.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:38.925 align:middle line:90%
I just call it the one.

00:54:38.925 --> 00:54:44.360 align:middle line:90%


00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:84%

These things have been on
the planet since we have,

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I really think there's a
better way to treat addiction

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:21.910 align:middle line:84%
or to treat the sort of
despair and anxiety and malaise

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.145 align:middle line:84%
that many of us are
feeling more and more.

is just on this blue ball

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that psychedelics
give you that perspective.

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I hope that they can
engender more cooperation,

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.890 align:middle line:84%
more us versus them,
more of this idea

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that separation is an illusion,
and that we all sort of

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.300 align:middle line:84%
have the answers
for our own growth

00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.325 align:middle line:84%
and for the healing
of the planet.

connected to spirit and
connected to each other

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and connected to nature, so much
of their fear would dissipate.
