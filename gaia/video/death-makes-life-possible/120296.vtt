[music playing]

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's such a blessing to have
a place like this to sit

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and just smell the air
and hear the creek.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And know that I'll fade into
it at some point in my life.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.612 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
I'm 53 years old and was
told about five weeks ago

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.847 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:38%
that I'm dying.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I've been given about six to
eight months left to live,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and that's really what's
happening in my life

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
at the moment.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Being OK with dying is
a weird place to be.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's very disconnected from
most of the people I know.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
They don't get it.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
They think that I've given in.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:11.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's still really hard
for me to talk about it.

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:19.913 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
I know that he's upset
about dying and leaving

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.815 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:38%
his loved ones.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:26.586 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But what's amazing is that he's
so at peace with this journey

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that he's going
through and where it's

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.858 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
going to take him afterwards.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:36.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
What keeps me 
non-agitated about death

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.966 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is appreciation for the
life I've already had.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.435 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I've had a beautiful
marriage, and my kids

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
are fabulous people.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:48.809 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And they hold, fortunately,
some of the best parts of me.

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.345 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.465 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
Have you had any
experiences yourself

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.668 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
that give you an insight into
what happens when we die?

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:17.471 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
I've thought about
death since the age

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
of six years when my grandfather
passed away suddenly.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's taken me almost a
lifetime to fully comprehend

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:36.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that death is an ongoing process
that makes life possible.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:41.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
What makes the universe
fresh is that it's dying

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it's being reborn, and
it's dying, being reborn.

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.633 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And every time it's
reborn, it actually

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
creates a better
version of itself,

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.271 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and we call it evolution.

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.476 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
In the United States
of America, I'd

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.046 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
say most people pretend
that death doesn't exist.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:02.883 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
They call it a crime,
or call it a mistake,

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.684 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
they don't want
to do with it all.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.355 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
And actually, death
is our birthright.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:11.124 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So to think of it
in any other way

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:16.063 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is really just asking for
misery and pain in your life.

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:17.664 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Because everybody dies.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:24.004 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Every form of life dies--
what we call "dies."

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:29.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We came today because one of
the gibbons died recently,

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:34.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and Nikko, the partner, is
here and apparently he's

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.682 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
been in a kind of
state of grief.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:39.152 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
Nikko had a mate that he
lived with, named Onyx,

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:42.022 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
and they've been together
since 1986, which

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.291 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:75%
is a very long time, 26 years.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.026 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Gibbons in the wild
are monogamous,

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so it's pretty common for
them to have that pair bond.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They tend to stick together.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They're one of the very few
primates that is monogamous.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.103 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Most are not.

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.039 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Definitely that
was hard for him.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:03.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
His activity level decreased
pretty significantly.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Gibbons in the wild will do this
beautiful song every morning,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.783 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and it's a duet between
the bonded pair,

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:12.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and he stopped singing
for several weeks.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We're at about eight
or nine weeks out now,

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:18.291 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
and he's really starting to get
back to normal, which is great.

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.393 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
We're really happy to see that.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:24.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We're sad when animals
die, but birth and death

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:25.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is all part of the same cycle.

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:28.068 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And you know, when leaves
fall and decompose,

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
it makes the soil richer.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So you really do have to have
all aspects of life and death

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to live on this beautiful
planet that we live on.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.578 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:47.254 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
Deep within us, for reasons
that still strike me as quite

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:49.122 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
mysterious, I think
every organism

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
knows how to die, whether it's
a deer that finally just relaxes

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.096 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
in the mouth of the lion,
or thinking, myself,

00:04:56.096 --> 00:05:00.967 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
about a rock climbing story--
a fellow on El Capitan,

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.637 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
3,000 feet high, rappelled
off the end of his rope.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:09.009 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He forgot to tie a knot
in the end of his rope,

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so he just came off the end of
his rope and started falling.

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:15.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And people watching him told
me that he started screaming

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and writhing in the air,
trying to walk in the air,

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.086 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
which you just cannot do.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then after a few seconds
of that, just opened out.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.092 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
He relaxed and opened
out, as if he knew,

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.361 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you know, I don't want to spend
the last 10 seconds my life--

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because that's about how
long it takes to fall,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.566 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
roughly-- I don't want to spend
that panicking, and struggling,

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:33.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
and resisting.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.669 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There's something in us
that knows how to open out.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:36.436 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We've been doing
research on the idea

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.143 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that consciousness
may be something that

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:46.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
is more than just the brain.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:49.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It may involve the brain, but
it may reach beyond the brain.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.651 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
For example, we've done
a series of experiments

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that look at the possibility
that one person's intention can

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:59.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
influence another person's
biology, their physiology,

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at a distance and with
no sensory communication

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:04.664 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
between the two people.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:07.867 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This speaks to the idea that
consciousness is more than just

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:11.438 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
our physical being,
and that in fact, there

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
may be ways in which
consciousness transcends

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
physicality.

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:18.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The implications of that
for what happens when we die

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is that perhaps there's
something more to our essence.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.422 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
The event that changed my
life was, I was on my way

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.491 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
to dinner one
evening with my wife,

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
we'd been married
for five months.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
On our way to our
favorite restaurant,

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:39.766 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a van crossed the stop sign
at between 70 and 80 miles

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
an hour.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:47.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It broadsided our
car and bulldozed us

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
clear across 
Beverly Boulevard.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.246 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The car took off and
flew through the air,

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.216 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and hit that tree
in mid-air and came

00:06:56.216 --> 00:07:00.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to rest in those
bushes over there.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.889 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That night, the
doctor saved my life.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I was at the deepest
level of coma

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:08.361 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that they measure, a
Glasgow Coma Scale 3.

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
When I came out of the
coma, pieces of memory

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.899 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
started to come back.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The memory from
my coma came to me

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.138 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of a protector who
was traveling with me

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:20.206 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
through this inner space,
through this journey

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:21.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
into infinity.

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:30.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I was traveling through an
ancient grove on a boat,

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:31.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and I could hear
the sounds of rain

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
pattering down on the cabin.

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:37.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And there was a person
who was up one deck,

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:40.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
who I knew I would be safe
if I could only just go up

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.428 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
to be with her.

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.263 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And very slowly, in the
middle of the night,

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:46.999 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
it occurred to me who
that protector was,

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and I realized it was my wife.

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And the following morning, my
mother came to the hospital

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.177 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to explain that I hadn't
always been in this room,

00:07:57.177 --> 00:07:58.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
and in this bed.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.814 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
The reason I was in this
room, and in this bed,

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.283 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
was because I'd been
in an accident--

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:06.786 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
that before this room and this
bed, I'd been a filmmaker,

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:09.255 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
and that yes, I was
married to Marcy,

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:11.791 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
and that she died
instantly in the crash.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:15.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And during my month in
coma, she had been laid

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to rest in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:22.969 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So I'd lost everything, really,
that mattered most to me,

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.105 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and that started this
journey through consciousness

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:30.443 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to find what makes us who we
are, could I recover who I was,

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.879 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and also to find a
reason to go forward.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.614 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.790 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
Tony Redhouse is a Native
American practitioner

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.192 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:65%
from the Navajo tradition.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His work with hospice patients
and people in life transition

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.365 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
connects him with the
importance of living

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
with the reality of death.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.238 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
When you're laying
in a hospice bed,

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:02.342 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
you are going to look at
your whole life, everything

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:09.349 align:start line:10% position:50% size:81%
that you've created, and whether
you have lived true to yourself

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:12.919 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
or whether you have lived your
whole life for the expectations

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.521 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:45%
of everybody else.

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:21.094 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
My idea of life and death
is focusing on the present.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:24.364 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And what I've learned
in this is that if I

00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:29.436 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
think about what it is right now
that I really want to fulfill,

00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:33.239 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
what dream do I want to fulfill
in my life right now, that I

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.376 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
have the ability, the
passion, to do these things,

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
the energy to do them.

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I'm going to do them right now.

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:45.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I first got interested
in doing this work,

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:48.121 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
really when I was
a undergraduate.

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.191 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
And I was at a small, very
competitive university

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
that half the student body
graduated first or second

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.662 align:middle line:15% position:45% size:73%
in their high school classes.

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:57.397 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It also turned out
to be the school that

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:59.833 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
had the highest suicide rate in
the country per capita, which

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.701 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
wasn't in their course catalog.

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And the more I worried
about doing well,

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.406 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the harder it became to
study, and the harder

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:09.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it became to study, the
harder it became to do well.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I got into
this vicious cycle

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:12.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where I literally couldn't
sleep for a week straight.

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:18.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I remember sitting
in physics class,

00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:20.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I thought, you know,
I'll just kill myself.

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:21.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Why didn't I think
of that earlier?

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.958 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That'll put and end
to all this pain.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Because I came so close
to killing myself,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
that was my doorway.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You know, I came about as
close to doing that as you can

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.165 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
do without actually doing it.

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.967 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So naturally, I started
to ask questions.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
What is death about?

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:37.136 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Is death, you know, just
you kind of close your eyes

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.506 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and go to sleep, or is it
something more than that?

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We know that people have
a lot of fear of death.

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.448 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
How do you see
this idea of death?

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:54.621 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
When the autumn comes, the
leaves are brown, and the fall.

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:56.756 align:middle line:15% position:47% size:53%
And where do they go?

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.958 align:middle line:15% position:46% size:68%
They go back into the soil.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.695 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That nutrition of those leaves,
which becomes like compost,

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:06.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
goes into the roots,
and they come back

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:09.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and the new leaves
are born again.

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:12.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So the old leaves, if
they were afraid of dying,

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:14.607 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
how the new leaves will come?

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:17.477 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We are members of
the life force,

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and that life force continues.

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It's a dynamic life force.

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:25.485 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If we become static in
one body and never die,

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and we are afraid
of dying, that means

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
we are blocking the
dynamic force, which

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:35.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is ever changing, ever evolving,
ever transforming life force.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.831 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If we block that, world
will be a boring place.

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:44.837 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now, and the real Robert Sheldon
must answer your questions

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:53.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
truthfully, and he will answer--
and you will ask questions

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:59.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
until you [inaudible] your
opinion is the real Robert

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Sheldon.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And since you're
so pretty there,

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
let's start with
Betsy [inaudible].

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
Betsy?

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.526 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
[inaudible]

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:08.428 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Number one, what's the
name of your nightclub?

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:10.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
The South of the Line.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
The South?

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
South of the Line.

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:13.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
South of the Line.

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
[coughing]

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.253 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When that incident happened and
I swallowed the lighter fluid

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:37.557 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and got rushed to the hospital,
what was the family thinking?

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:40.493 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
Oh, it as a terrible
fear that we'd lose you.

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
When you have someone sick
like that, especially a child,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.866 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
there's a pallor
over the whole house.

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.901 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
You live a life, you
go through the motions,

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:52.138 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
but you don't enjoy things,
because we were so concerned.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
You could've died.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:54.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
You were so lucky.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:02.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
When my son was three or four,
we were driving one night,

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:05.551 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and it was a beautiful evening.

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And I said to him,
"Look at that full moon.

00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:11.324 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Isn't this a glorious
night to be alive?"

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:13.326 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And he said, "What
do you mean, mommy?

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:16.562 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Do you think dead people
can't see the full moon?"

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.498 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And I thought, I guess not.

00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:21.467 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I guess I think dead people
can't see the full moon.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:25.071 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And he said, "Oh no, mommy," he
said, "our friend Elizabeth,"

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:26.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
who had just died,
"she's up there,

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:29.175 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and she's looking at the
full moon, and she's singing,

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
enjoy yourself, it's
later than you think,"

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.183 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And so it was such a
great reminder to me,

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:40.286 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
out of the mouth of babes
comes this kind of wisdom

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:43.756 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that suggests that we are
more than our physicality

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:46.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and that there may
be possibilities

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
beyond physical death.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:53.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Have you ever had anybody
in your family or somebody

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
you knew who died?

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:58.705 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
My cat died, and he'd been
with me my whole life,

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:50%
so I was really sad.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.642 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
What do you think happened
to him when he died?

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:05.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I believe he went to
heaven and met other cats.

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:06.312 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
Uh-huh.

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:09.182 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So is there a
special cat heaven?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
No, I think it's all the
same, but they're just

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
with each other.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Have you ever wondered about it?

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:18.958 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I have wondered about
what happens after death,

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:23.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but I've never figured
out the answer.

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:26.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Let's just stay with the
topic right now about death.

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
Uh-huh.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So you for it, against it?

00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:50%
I'm against it, man.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.608 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:65%
The afterlife, I'm for it.

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:40.113 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:43%
Aha.
I hope it's real.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:42.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But again, like the paranormal
or the ESP or whatever,

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I just would be very
surprised if it turned out

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:46.352 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
there's some sort of afterlife.

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If there's not some
scientific natural way

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:52.058 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to explain where the pattern of
me gets stored in some medium

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.861 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and carried on into the future,
then the default position

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is that when you
die, nothing happens.

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:58.397 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
It's just-- you're just gone.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You're in the same place you
were before you were born,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.035 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
which is to say, nowhere.

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:05.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We're faced with that sort
of cold, hard reality,

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I think that
produces something--

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.575 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the anxiety for some people,
anyway, it doesn't bother me.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But I don't worry about
it, but I know apparently,

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:14.413 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
a lot of people do.

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.716 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So when you said that when
you're dead, you're dead,

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you're gone, there's nothing--

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.985 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Well, near as I can tell.

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:20.253 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I don't know for
sure, nobody knows.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.588 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But the evidence is
pretty overwhelming

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.223 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that that appears
to be the case.

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:25.458 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.798 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
Dr. Rudy Tanzi is
a neuroscientist

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:35.735 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
and does research on Alzheimer's
disease at Harvard University.

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:37.904 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
His views on
consciousness and what

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
happens after death are
unconventional and provocative.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You know, a neuroscientist
would tell you

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:50.249 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that your identity is just
within your neural network,

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:53.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that everything you do and
learn is just associated

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.221 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
with what you already know.

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So then that leaves us
with the question of when

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you die, and the brain is gone,
the electrical activity is

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
turned off, is everything gone?

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.833 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The other side of the coin
that most neuroscientists don't

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:10.136 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
want to talk about is,
where is consciousness?

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.139 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Where are memories when
you think about the past?

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.674 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Where were they stored?

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:17.543 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean, we don't have an answer
for that in neuroscience.

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:20.847 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I ask students, I ask other
professors this all the time.

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:22.281 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They say-- it's
always hand waving.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You know, it's in
your neural network.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm like, well where, exactly?

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:27.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Well, in the synapses.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:30.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
No, the synapses fire, if
fire is to be called a memory,

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:32.792 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
but where is the actual memory?

00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:35.862 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Where is my mother's
face before I see it?

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:39.332 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
What's the thumb drive
of the brain that stores

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:41.067 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
the JPEG of my mother's face?

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:41.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
We have no idea.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.808 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
I've been doing
anesthesia for 38 years,

00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:51.677 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
and it's still
amazing to me that we

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:54.614 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
give a medication like Propofol,
or have a patient breathe

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:58.384 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
the gas like Sevoflurane and
their consciousness goes away.

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:00.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What's missing, primarily,
is consciousness.

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:02.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Other brain activities continue.

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:06.492 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So anesthesia is fairly
specific, erasing consciousness

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:09.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and memory without affecting
other brain activities.

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.898 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Now, how that works
is still unknown.

00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:13.366 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But the real question
in anesthesia

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.867 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
isn't so much why
they go to sleep,

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.836 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
but why they're awake
in the first place.

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:18.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The prevalent theory
is that the brain

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is a computer whose
fundamental units, bits, are

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
neurons firing or not firing.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.846 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But neurons are far
more complicated,

00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:28.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
not to mention being
alive, and we don't really

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
know what that is, yet.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.853 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
If you consider single cell
paramecium, it's one cell,

00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:37.757 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it swims around, it finds food,
it finds a mate, it has sex,

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:38.891 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
it can learn.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.192 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
If you suck it into
a capillary tube,

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.795 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
it escapes, faster
and faster each time.

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.931 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And yet, it's only one cell,
it doesn't have any synapses,

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:46.866 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
it's not part of a network.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:49.902 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
So it, in and of itself,
has at least cognition.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm not saying it's conscious.

00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:54.407 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But it performs
intelligent activities.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So I think it's an
insult to neurons

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:59.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to say they're simple on-off
states when a single cell

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
paramecium is so clever.

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:03.883 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
We're asking very
ancient questions

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:06.886 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
that humans have been asking
for hundreds, if not thousands

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:23%
of years.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
When we talk about
death and dying,

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:11.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
what's the nature of
reality, ultimately?

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:20.266 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
We discovered that there
is a part of reality

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.435 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:65%
that is beyond experience.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.972 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It doesn't consist of
things, it consists of forms.

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:27.907 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
These forms are
real, even though you

00:18:27.907 --> 00:18:31.811 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
can't see them, because
they can actualize

00:18:31.811 --> 00:18:33.279 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in the empirical world.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.014 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Everything that you
see is an actualization

00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:38.784 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
of a form in this
background realm.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:42.955 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So the nature of it is
that of a potentiality.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.291 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Potentiality is
thought-like, [inaudible]

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the mind [inaudible]
their cosmic mind.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:52.832 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
There are two views
in consciousness

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.233 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that come from science.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:58.404 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
One is that consciousness is an
emergent property of the brain,

00:18:58.404 --> 00:19:02.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and therefore also an emergent
property of evolution.

00:19:02.008 --> 00:19:05.945 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
That's the materialistic
reductionist view of science.

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:09.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There's another view
that's creeping up now

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:13.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in some postmodern
scientists, and this

00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:16.288 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is the view is that
consciousness is actually

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
not an emergent
property of evolution.

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.694 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
In fact, evolution is
driven by consciousness,

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:26.866 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
that consciousness is
non-local, it is transcendent,

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:30.436 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
it's eternal, it's the
grand state of the universe

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:33.305 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:75%
from where everything emerges.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:38.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And being prior to
time and transcendent,

00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:43.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
it is not subject
to birth or death.

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:46.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When we think about the evidence
for what happens when we die,

00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:48.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
there is this idea
that there's something

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:52.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about our consciousness that may
transcend our physical being.

00:19:52.892 --> 00:19:54.994 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We know that from a
scientific point of view,

00:19:54.994 --> 00:19:56.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
people have looked
at near death,

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.999 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
out of body, reincarnation.

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:01.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
These kinds of
experiences actually

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
can be documented and studied.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.073 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
I'm trained as a hard
scientist, my PhD

00:20:07.073 --> 00:20:09.075 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
is in pharmacology
and toxicology,

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.876 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
and when I was in
graduate school,

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.878 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:70%
my mother committed suicide.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.681 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
And I had been a scientist
for as long as I can remember,

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
and so I looked to
science-- what does science

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.019 align:middle line:15% position:44% size:78%
have to say to these questions.

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:21.987 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
What happens when we die?

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:24.356 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Where is she?
Where did she go?

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:27.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Our main focus is the
survival of consciousness.

00:20:27.026 --> 00:20:29.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This thing that I call
me, what happens to it

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:32.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
when I'm no longer
a physical body,

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:35.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and not associated with
a physical body anymore?

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:37.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so the primary way
that we're looking at that

00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:40.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
is with the studying
mediums, people

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:44.844 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who report regular
communication with the deceased.

00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:48.013 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Many people believe that they
can communicate with the dead,

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.115 align:middle line:15% position:47% size:58%
they call them mediums.

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:51.417 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
So what we're doing
in an experiment now

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:56.055 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
is to take a high density
EEG recording of a medium

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:58.057 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:75%
as a medium is doing her work.

00:20:58.057 --> 00:21:00.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We want to then study
in the laboratory what

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
is happening in the
brains of mediums

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
while they say they're
in communication

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.502 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
with a departed person.

00:21:09.502 --> 00:21:11.737 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So we know from past
experience that the mediums

00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:16.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
will be roughly 70% correct,
which is way beyond chance.

00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:19.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Where is the information
coming from that a medium is

00:21:19.078 --> 00:21:23.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
getting when it turns out
to be veritically correct?

00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And we don't know the
answer to that, yet.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And what we thought is
that by using an EEG

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and looking at brain
activity of the medium,

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:31.123 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that might give us
a clue as to whether

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or not it is something
like telepathy

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:35.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
between the living
or something else.

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:37.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If it's telepathy with
the dead, well that

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:39.331 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
would be quite new
and interesting.

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:51.076 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
I lost my sister four years
ago, and I wrote a song for her,

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:53.679 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
it's, "Do You
Remember Who You Are?"

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.915 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And I wrote it for her.

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:58.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I'm going to this psychic,
and the first thing out

00:21:58.284 --> 00:21:59.485 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
of her mouth, I
didn't say a word

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:05.491 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to her was, "Your sister,
she loves her song."

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.826 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
And I started to sob.

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:11.363 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know, and this is that
feeling, again, of connecting

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:14.366 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to that which never dies.

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:16.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
People have all
kinds of experiences

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:20.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that kind of lie outside
what we accept as truth,

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
or what is possible.

00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I think that the kind of
science that we're doing,

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.147 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
which really looks at the powers
and potentials of consciousness

00:22:28.147 --> 00:22:31.817 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
helps to expand our
sense of possibility.

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:34.153 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And more important,
it allows us to ask

00:22:34.153 --> 00:22:36.155 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
questions that
have been put down,

00:22:36.155 --> 00:22:38.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that have been considered taboo.

00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A medium that we work
with, a woman contacted

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
her and her aunt had died.

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:46.398 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And they lived in Peru,
and they had told her,

00:22:46.398 --> 00:22:48.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
"Your aunt died of
stomach cancer."

00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:52.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
She went to a medium and she
wasn't getting stomach cancer.

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.974 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
She was getting that the
woman had been murdered--

00:22:54.974 --> 00:22:56.242 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the aunt had been murdered.

00:22:56.242 --> 00:22:58.844 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And she provided a first name,
and she had lots of like,

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:01.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
identifying information, and
the personality came through

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
very strongly.

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.682 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And the sitter took
that information

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:08.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to the Peruvian government
and they exhumed the body,

00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:11.323 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and they did another autopsy.

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:13.525 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And there was no
evidence of cancer,

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:16.629 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but there was evidence that
her trachea had been crushed.

00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:19.865 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They found the name-- the
name the medium had given

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:24.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
was the name of the person
that had killed the aunt,

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:26.939 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and that person is
currently serving

00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:29.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in Peruvian jail for her murder.

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:37.182 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
When I was 15 years
old, I was in a place

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:39.285 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
where I shouldn't have been,
with someone I shouldn't have

00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:42.721 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
been with, and we had a serious
motorcycle accident involving

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.089 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
a drunk driver.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:47.726 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I remember watching my body
tumbling through the air

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and landing on the
roadway with a crash.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.666 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Out of body experiences
can't easily

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:56.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
be explained by
materialist science.

00:23:56.235 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And if it hadn't happened
to me personally,

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.107 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I might not believe something
like this was possible.

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:05.744 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
Dr. Peter Fenwick is a
distinguished neurophysiologist

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:08.714 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
and senior lecturer at
King's College London.

00:24:08.714 --> 00:24:11.583 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
His studies of death,
near death, and out

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.953 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of body experiences
provide interesting insight

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:17.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
into what happens at
the point of dying.

00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:21.226 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I was led to this
work, really by chance.

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:23.295 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
I believed that
there was nothing

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.264 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:65%
in near death experiences.

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:27.933 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
They were experiences which
happened in California,

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:30.936 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
they never crossed
the sea to England.

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:35.607 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And so I thought that they
probably were more imagination.

00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:38.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Then, a case came into
my consulting room.

00:24:38.277 --> 00:24:42.247 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He'd had a cardiac arrest, he'd
had a near death experience.

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:44.183 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
And I knew that they were real.

00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:52.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I was sitting,
holding the telephone.

00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.526 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Lightning came down
the phone line.

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:56.161 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
It hit me in the
side of the head,

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:58.364 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
it went down my spine,
it welded the nails

00:24:58.364 --> 00:25:01.166 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
of the heels of my shoes
to the nails in the floor.

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:03.268 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
It threw me in the air,
suspended me in the air,

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:05.637 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
and slammed me back
down on the bed.

00:25:05.637 --> 00:25:07.306 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:50%
It melted the phone.

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:10.342 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And I was burning
and hurting so bad.

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:12.678 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Then all of the
sudden, I lift out.

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:17.249 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And everything was cool,
I looked down on the bed,

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:18.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I saw me on the bed.

00:25:18.584 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I saw Sandy come
running down the hall.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
My friend who was on the
other end of the phone

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:27.126 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
heard the explosion, he came,
he called the paramedics.

00:25:27.126 --> 00:25:29.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The greatest thing that I've
discovered at that point

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:33.332 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
was that first, the
place that I was

00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:36.001 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
was between this
world and the next,

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:38.904 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but I knew it better than
any place I had ever been

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:42.241 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
living in this physical life.

00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:47.079 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It looks as if when
brain function is down,

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
there is a set of experiences
in which you leave your body

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:53.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and watch the
resuscitation process.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now what happens during
this out of body process?

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.726 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
No brain function, you've
got a cardiac arrest,

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:02.227 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
you're not breathing.

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:04.363 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
All the brain stem
reflexes have gone,

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:09.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so it is, in fact, a very
good model for death itself.

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:12.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I watched them load
me in the ambulance.

00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:15.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I watched the
things that went on.

00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:19.711 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I really didn't care, because
where I was, floating above it,

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was so much better than where I
was when I was involved in it.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.454 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I was in the ambulance,
and the guy said, "He's gone.

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:29.621 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
He's gone."

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:30.389 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
And me?

00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:33.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I thought, gone where?

00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:37.062 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I'm here, the paramedic's here.

00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:38.397 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Where is anybody going?

00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:42.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I heard these chimes,
and I moved down this tunnel

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and come into this
place of light

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I sensed an absolute
sense of safety.

00:26:49.408 --> 00:26:55.481 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If it's true, that you really
do have experiences when

00:26:55.481 --> 00:26:57.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
the brain is not
working, then it

00:26:57.516 --> 00:27:03.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
means that consciousness, or
mind, if you like, are in fact

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:04.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
not the same as brain.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:08.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It's a fundamental step.

00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:11.997 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I'm thinking,
actually, about how

00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:18.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
this one moment changed my
life, it ended my wife's life.

00:27:18.437 --> 00:27:21.907 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And that perhaps is because
what I've come to feel

00:27:21.907 --> 00:27:24.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is that consciousness
only knows one moment.

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:27.112 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's the one moment
that we all share,

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:31.149 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the one moment in which
we live our whole lives.

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:34.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Our subconscious doesn't
know the time of day,

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:36.889 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
our subconscious
doesn't know the month.

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:39.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
All our subconscious
knows is now.

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:44.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And this one moment, this now,
is what's still inside me,

00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:47.466 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
will always be within me.

00:27:47.466 --> 00:27:49.034 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The most fully
collected consciousness

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:51.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I'd ever experienced
was at that borderline

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:55.474 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
between life and death.

00:27:55.474 --> 00:27:57.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I'll never forget
the river of time,

00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:02.948 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
flowing from the
horizon towards me.

00:28:02.948 --> 00:28:05.918 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
From the future to the present.

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:09.488 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And at a certain point in
my coma, I felt it stop.

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:17.496 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the river of time ran
still, I call it the moment

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:19.831 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
when everything is now.

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:24.236 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And then I felt it flow
in the other direction.

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:29.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Time was traveling away from
me, and I felt very alone,

00:28:29.508 --> 00:28:31.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
because I realized
at that moment

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:35.681 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that when something
passes us into the past

00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:41.253 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
it doesn't return,
and it would be gone.

00:28:41.253 --> 00:28:44.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And I remember how I felt
at that moment in my coma.

00:28:44.423 --> 00:28:48.594 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I remember how I understood
that in some ways, that

00:28:48.594 --> 00:28:53.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was a moment of death,
and a moment of rebirth.

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:56.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I'm frozen at that
moment, emotionally.

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:02.708 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:41%
The Pam Reynolds
case is one more

00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:06.578 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
dramatic near-death
experience episodes.

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:10.082 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Pam Reynolds had a
brain aneurysm, which

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:12.985 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
was in a portion of the brain
that was difficult to get to,

00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:16.555 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the surgeons were concerned
that if they tried to get to it

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:18.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and they made an accident,
that it could burst,

00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and she'd be dead before
they'd be able to repair it.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So they used a radical
surgical method

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:27.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which would require draining
all the blood out of her head.

00:29:27.733 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When you do this, and the
body has been cooled down

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to 60 degrees
Fahrenheit, eventually

00:29:34.473 --> 00:29:37.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
goes into shock and
then cardiac arrest.

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:39.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So that's like
one level of dead.

00:29:39.311 --> 00:29:41.146 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You drain the blood
out of the body,

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:44.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
then the body's really
dead, it's like double dead.

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:49.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then they check by putting
very loud clicks in both ears.

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:52.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You're wearing earphones
that have a very loud click,

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:54.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
so it will make a
brain stem response.

00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:56.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They monitor that, and the
brain stem response goes away,

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
you're like, triple dead.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's every form of dead
that we know is dead.

00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:04.503 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So she had a full-blown
near-death experience.

00:30:04.503 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I remember the top
of my head tingling,

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I just sort of popped
out of the top of my head.

00:30:15.414 --> 00:30:17.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I was then looking
down at the body.

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I knew it was my body,
but I didn't care.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
She did say a couple
of things that

00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:27.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
were unusual about the nature
of the saw that was used to open

00:30:27.192 --> 00:30:29.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
her skull, and a certain
sound that it made,

00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:33.365 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and music that was being
played during the surgery,

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:36.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and it turned out to be correct.

00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:38.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I had assumed that
they were going

00:30:38.704 --> 00:30:44.509 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to open the skull with a saw,
I had heard the term, saw,

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:48.814 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but what I saw looked a lot
more like a drill than a saw.

00:30:48.814 --> 00:30:52.651 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It even had little bits
that were kept in this case.

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.554 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
One of the reasons to believe
that her experience was

00:30:55.554 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
unusual, at least,
is that when you

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
are going under
general anesthetics,

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:02.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or if you're getting
hypoxia, or all

00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:04.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the usual
physiological shutdowns,

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:08.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
your ability to have a
clear thought very rapidly

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:09.768 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
diminishes.

00:31:09.768 --> 00:31:13.939 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And your ability to remember
what happened also goes away.

00:31:13.939 --> 00:31:19.678 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I felt a presence, and I sort
of turned around to look at it.

00:31:19.678 --> 00:31:24.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And that's when I saw the
very tiny pinpoint of light.

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:28.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I went toward the light.

00:31:28.687 --> 00:31:30.555 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The closer I got to
the light, I began

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:34.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to discern different
figures, different people,

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and I distinctly heard
my grandmother call me,

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and I immediately went to her.

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:45.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
It felt great.

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:49.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I asked if God was the
light, and the answer

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:54.045 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
was no, God is not the light.

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:56.248 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The light is what
happens wen God breathes.

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:01.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I distinctly
remember thinking,

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:06.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I'm standing in
the breath of God.

00:32:06.158 --> 00:32:09.728 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So it's one of the more
startling cases where

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:12.964 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
the evidence that she was really
dead, dead, dead was very good.

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:21.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In many of the
traditions in the world,

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:26.411 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
their understanding is that
when we die, that we go,

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:30.282 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and some say we go to place
of rest, a place of learning,

00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:34.286 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that is, not in
the material sense.

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:37.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And that then we come back
again in another form,

00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:41.126 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
or as a human being, or
as another life form,

00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:44.763 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and we have other
kinds of experiences.

00:32:45.864 --> 00:32:48.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
What do I think might be next?

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:51.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
I think we get recycled.

00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:53.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I think we come
back into life for

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
new and different experiences.

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The purpose or the
meaning of that,

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:00.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I'm not going to pretend
that I honestly know.

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:02.848 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I think we do sort
of progress over time

00:33:02.848 --> 00:33:04.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
in our multiple lives.

00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:10.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We change, we learn, and we
learn from these past lives,

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:14.793 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and we become, let's say,
better, deeper, shinier.

00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:16.862 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
That's my belief structure.

00:33:16.862 --> 00:33:19.297 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I'll try to let you know
when I get to the other side.

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:22.801 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
That's all I can say.

00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:24.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
What happened before
you were born?

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:27.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I mean, that's an
important question, too.

00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:28.940 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Where were you
before you showed up?

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the end, we're all made of
the same stuff-- earth, water,

00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:37.682 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and air, which
recycles as our body.

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:41.286 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Death affects the body,
but not the spirit.

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:48.827 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
The spirit recycles itself
through the physical body

00:33:48.827 --> 00:33:51.162 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
For over 50 years,
research has been

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:53.798 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
conducted at the
University of Virginia

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:56.701 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
into cases of
apparent reincarnation

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:59.838 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
and the possible implications
of our consciousness

00:33:59.838 --> 00:34:02.007 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:81%
experiencing multiple lifetimes.

00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:04.409 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
After 50 years of
research now, we've

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:07.545 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
got 2,500 cases in our
files of young children

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.881 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
who reported memories
of previous lives.

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.549 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Several hundred
of the cases have

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:13.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
involved birth marks
or birth defects

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:17.522 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that match wounds on the
body the previous person.

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:20.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And some of them have also
included written records where

00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:23.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we know precisely, exactly
what the child said

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
about the previous
life, and then we

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:29.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
can match that with the previous
person that's been identified.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.236 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
One is a little boy
named Sam Taylor.

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:33.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
When he was about a
year and a half old,

00:34:33.872 --> 00:34:36.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
his dad was changing
his diaper one day

00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:39.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and Sam looked up at him and
said, "When I was your age,

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I used to change your diapers."

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.349 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But he kept saying this
stuff, he kept saying,

00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:47.452 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
"I was grandpa," and,
"I used to be big."

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:49.788 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And he came out with some
pretty interesting details.

00:34:49.788 --> 00:34:53.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Like, he talked about the
grandfather's sister being

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
murdered, and in
fact, she had been

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:58.897 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
killed some 60 years before,
and his parents felt certain

00:34:58.897 --> 00:35:01.132 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
that he'd never heard about it.

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:05.337 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He also talked about his wife,
which was his grandmother,

00:35:05.337 --> 00:35:09.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but his wife from the past life,
said some specific details.

00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:12.344 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And then when she died, she
died when he was about 4

00:35:12.344 --> 00:35:16.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- 1/2, and his dad
went out and collected

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
belongings and so
forth, and came back

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
with some family photos.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.921 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
So one night, Sam's mom had them
spread out on the coffee table,

00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:24.289 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
just looking at the
various pictures.

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:27.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Well, Sam walks over
and starts pointing

00:35:27.192 --> 00:35:28.927 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to pictures of his
grandfather and saying,

00:35:28.927 --> 00:35:30.929 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
"That's me, that's me."

00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:33.932 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And also a picture of his--
it was his grandfather's

00:35:33.932 --> 00:35:36.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
first car, and there's
no one in the car,

00:35:36.001 --> 00:35:37.669 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but it's just a
picture of the car.

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:40.171 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And he got very excited and
said, "Hey, that's my car."

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:43.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So to test him,
his mom showed him

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:46.945 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
picture of a class photo from
elementary school and said.

00:35:46.945 --> 00:35:49.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"OK, well then show me where
you are in the picture."

00:35:49.114 --> 00:35:50.982 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And he ran his finger
along the different

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:53.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
faces and stopped at the one
of his grandfather and said,

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:54.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
"That's me."

00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So that was one that has what
we call recognition, where

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.326 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
he was able to pick
out his grandfather

00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:03.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and, in a group photo.

00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:05.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It's what we call
a same family case

00:36:05.964 --> 00:36:09.467 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
where a child is seeming to
remember the life of a family

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:10.468 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
member.

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:12.537 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Some people criticize
the work simply

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
by dismissing it out of
hand by saying reincarnation

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
can't happen, so obviously
there's no value to this work.

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:23.114 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But that's really not
a very scientific,

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:24.983 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I mean, sort of
scientism, perhaps,

00:36:24.983 --> 00:36:30.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but it's not a scientific
view of letting your beliefs

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:32.157 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
prejudice your view
of the evidence

00:36:32.157 --> 00:36:35.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when it should, of course,
be the other way around.

00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So have you had people
in your life that died?

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:39.998 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Oh, absolutely.

00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:41.999 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
All my parents are
dead, all four of them.

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:44.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I had two bio parents,
two stepparents.

00:36:44.002 --> 00:36:46.671 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Yep, so I've been
all through that.

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:49.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So I drove around
to doctor's offices,

00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:50.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
I went through all that.

00:36:50.809 --> 00:36:54.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm sure my telomeres are
much shorter from the stress

00:36:54.012 --> 00:36:56.014 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of being a caretaker.

00:36:56.014 --> 00:36:58.883 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Yeah, so that brings home the
reality of death for sure.

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.385 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
But they're gone.

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:02.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean, absolutely, I don't
think they're anywhere else.

00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:04.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You know, occasionally
afterwards,

00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:07.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I thought I heard my mom's
voice, that sort of thing.

00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:11.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But we all have these auditory
hallucinations a little bit.

00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:14.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But then it went away
shortly after that.

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:18.036 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So it's just-- it's
just part of growing up

00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:20.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the cycle of life, and I
guess that's how I look at it.

00:37:20.305 --> 00:37:23.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I just don't--
So you had this experience--

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:26.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
--dwell on it.
--maybe that your mom did?

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
You heard her voice?

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:30.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I just not-- I don't want to
make a big thing about that,

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:31.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I just remember a
couple times in bed,

00:37:31.783 --> 00:37:33.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
you know, sort of like, 
late at night,

00:37:33.852 --> 00:37:35.053 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you know how you're
sort of falling asleep?

00:37:35.053 --> 00:37:36.521 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It's one of those
transition things

00:37:36.521 --> 00:37:38.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
where your mind is producing
all sorts of things.

00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:40.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I don't think it's
anything more than that.

00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:41.793 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I think more than the
other hallucinations

00:37:41.793 --> 00:37:44.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I've had from sleep deprivation,
from sensory deprivation

00:37:44.062 --> 00:37:45.096 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
things.

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:48.366 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I've done all that stuff.

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:52.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So my father, when he
died, he was a typical man

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:54.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of his generation.

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:57.876 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Loving guy, but at a distance,
you know what I mean?

00:37:57.876 --> 00:38:02.313 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
So he passed on, and
around a week or two later,

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:06.084 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
and I was in this
very room one morning,

00:38:06.084 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
and suddenly one
day, there he was.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:17.095 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I was really almost overwhelmed
with the unconditional love

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:20.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that I was experiencing
from him, directly from him.

00:38:20.198 --> 00:38:22.967 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
I realized he was
very close to me.

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:25.103 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Very close in my space.

00:38:25.103 --> 00:38:26.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Too close.

00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:29.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I had to just say,
"Dad, you know,

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:31.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
just give me a
little space, here."

00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:32.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
So he did.

00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:36.581 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The love was still there,
none of that changed.

00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:39.350 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
But he was happy.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
He was kind of
radiating happiness.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:46.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And once in awhile I would ask
him, in my mind, a question.

00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:48.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
What about this,
what about that?

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:52.130 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And just get a few words, a
few impressions, a few senses

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.032 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of what was going on for him.

00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:56.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And then after about
two days, maybe three,

00:38:56.301 --> 00:38:59.137 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
he just-- that was
it-- just moved on.

00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:01.206 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I just said OK, you know?

00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:05.810 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Thanks, it's been
good, you know?

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Good luck, best wishes
wherever you're heading.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.317 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And thank you, I--
thank you for the time,

00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:20.158 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the-- particularly the--
just that unconditional love.

00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:22.227 align:middle line:15% position:47% size:63%
Oh, it's great, isn't it?

00:39:22.227 --> 00:39:24.162 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:45%
I mean, just life.

00:39:24.162 --> 00:39:28.499 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
I mean, take a breath,
let that body just extract

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:34.706 align:middle line:15% position:45% size:73%
that oxygen. Oxygen is a gas.

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:35.039 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
Ha.

00:39:37.976 --> 00:39:40.511 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
We're keenly aware
of consciousness,

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:44.182 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
and we're aware of consciousness
does not come from the body.

00:39:44.182 --> 00:39:46.618 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
We're aware of consciousness
independent of the body.

00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:50.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And so people are
more aware that they

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:54.192 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
are consciousness having
a body rather than a body

00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:56.361 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
with consciousness.

00:39:56.361 --> 00:39:58.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Oftentimes, people
are actually very

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
anxious about whether
they're going to die,

00:40:00.198 --> 00:40:02.934 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and they make decisions
about their life,

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:04.936 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
whether they're going to die.

00:40:04.936 --> 00:40:07.205 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And in fact, that's not where
we should be making decisions

00:40:07.205 --> 00:40:08.773 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
from.

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:13.211 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Our decisions and choices
need to be made from,

00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:15.747 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
what gifts am I going to
give before I leave here?

00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:17.649 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
What talents am I
going to cultivate?

00:40:17.649 --> 00:40:19.217 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
How am I going to be
a beneficial presence

00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:20.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
on the planet?

00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And that's a much
higher frequency than,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
"I'm afraid I'm going to die."

00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:28.192 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I think the structure
of our society right

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:30.561 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
now is a fear of death.

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:33.598 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And, I mean, I hate to sound so
blunt about this, but the whole

00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:35.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
anti aging movement?

00:40:35.233 --> 00:40:37.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You're a loser if you die.

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You're a loser if you get old.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And yet, somehow, we all do.

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:43.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And our society has set
it up that death and aging

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:48.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
are the enemy, whereas
they're inevitable.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.250 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I truly know that I have no
control when I live or die.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.919 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So the combination of
accepting a lack of control

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:57.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
over my own death, and
a very deep gratitude

00:40:57.789 --> 00:40:59.991 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
for the life I've already
had, is my real reason

00:40:59.991 --> 00:41:01.259 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
for being at peace.

00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:10.068 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
A lot of people have
fear around them,

00:41:10.068 --> 00:41:15.039 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
and yet here you were, fighting
in Korea, and, you know,

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:18.743 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
piloting crafts that took
off from aircraft carriers,

00:41:18.743 --> 00:41:21.779 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
and then having to land again
in the middle of the ocean.

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:24.982 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know, you've described it
like a needle in a haystack.

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then getting on the Apollo
14 capsule after Apollo 13

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:35.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
almost was disastrous--
those actions imply a kind

00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:38.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of fearlessness about death.

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:43.034 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I pondered my own
immortality or mortality.

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:48.373 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But I think the more
important thing for we humans

00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:54.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is, learn to feel
pleasurable, happy, successful

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:57.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in what we do in
this life and feel

00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:00.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that we're being productive,
caring and helpful

00:42:00.318 --> 00:42:03.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to each other and to our
families, that that's really

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:06.324 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
more important than
whether we really

00:42:06.324 --> 00:42:10.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
have all the answers to what
happens after this life.

00:42:10.228 --> 00:42:12.864 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Living this life to its
fullest, and properly

00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:14.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and happily, to me, is
far more fundamental.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:21.239 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I got a call from my brother,
I was living in Phoenix,

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:23.040 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
my dad was in Tucson.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:29.647 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He had taken a fall, and he was
in ICU, and he was in a coma.

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:31.416 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And so when I left
the house in Phoenix,

00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:33.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I took two things with me.

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:38.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I took my drum and I
took two eagle feathers.

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:42.593 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I went upstairs to the
ICU room where my dad was at,

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.362 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and here I am, took my
drum, two eagle feathers.

00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:46.431 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
My dad was like this.

00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:50.468 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
He was laying there
with his eyes open,

00:42:50.468 --> 00:42:51.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and his hands like this.

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:07.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I took a eagle
feather, and I put one

00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:10.354 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in each hand-- I placed
one in each hand.

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:20.465 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I took my drum, and I
wanted my dad to wake up.

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:24.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I wanted him to live, because
my mom and dad had been together

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:25.736 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
56 years.

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:27.071 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That was my intention
when I came down,

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:28.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I want to see him wake up.

00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:31.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I want him back with my mom.

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And so I put the eagle
feathers in his hands

00:43:33.478 --> 00:43:36.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I took the
drum, and I simply--

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:37.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
[drumbeat]

00:43:39.584 --> 00:43:41.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
--I created a heartbeat.

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:45.456 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And I went from head
to toe over his life,

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and I prayed over him.

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:53.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And I wanted him to be healed.

00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:10.448 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And on the last beat, my
dad went into a convulsion,

00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:17.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and he closed his
eyes, and he released.

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
When he did, he grabbed that
eagle feather in his right

00:44:20.458 --> 00:44:22.493 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and he closed his hand.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:31.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I knew what I had done was
what he wanted to have done.

00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:33.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And he-- when he grabbed
that eagle feather,

00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:37.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I knew that I had been sent to
do what I was supposed to do.

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.143 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:51.522 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
We need to talk about death
and the fear of death.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:54.225 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
I personally have more
fear of an unfulfilled

00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:57.795 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:65%
life than of death itself.

00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.765 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
I know I'm afraid of
death because I don't

00:45:00.765 --> 00:45:02.500 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:75%
want to think a different way.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.769 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
I don't want to become
a different person.

00:45:04.769 --> 00:45:06.304 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I just want to stay who I am.

00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:16.514 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If I change, I want to remember
this form, or this person.

00:45:16.514 --> 00:45:20.751 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Contemplating death can
really bring us peace.

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:24.889 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
Without impermanency,
there's no change.

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:28.526 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
If there's no change,
there is no life.

00:45:28.526 --> 00:45:32.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Can you imagine your
life without any change?

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Doesn't exist.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.571 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Death is a taboo to talk about.

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:44.442 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Just is-- many people don't
want to talk about death,

00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:48.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because it's something that
it happens to somebody else.

00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:52.550 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
But that doesn't know a culture,
death doesn't know religion,

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.853 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
death doesn't know-- death
doesn't discriminate.

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:57.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
That's the thing,
is that in the end

00:45:57.288 --> 00:45:59.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's going to
happen to all of us,

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and we have to be prepared for
it in any time, in any moment.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's hard to watch the
people I love suffer.

00:46:07.632 --> 00:46:10.468 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I have to say, it's harder
for them than it is for me,

00:46:10.468 --> 00:46:13.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because I'm not
suffering with this.

00:46:13.004 --> 00:46:15.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I suffer with
physical discomfort.

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:21.579 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The pain is not fun, pain
sucks, but dying doesn't.

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:22.613 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Dying is just what we do.

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:33.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I want to thank
everyone for coming,

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:37.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for bringing your unique and
special love for Lee here

00:46:37.328 --> 00:46:38.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
today.

00:46:38.596 --> 00:46:41.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Lee was absolutely
adamant that this

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:44.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
was supposed to be a celebration
of life-- his and everyone

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
else's here.

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:47.338 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And so with that
in mind, we figured

00:46:47.338 --> 00:46:48.939 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we'd turn the
beginning over to Lee.

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:55.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I want you gently
to close your eyes

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:59.950 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and begin taking deep
breaths, in and out.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:05.990 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now start thinking of
people you love, those that

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.791 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
bring meaning to your life.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:15.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Begin to feel the sense of
appreciation in your body.

00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:18.769 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Do you feel it in your chest,
your stomach, your back?

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:25.376 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Continue to breathe
deeply in and out.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:32.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Now think of a place
that you'd love to be,

00:47:32.717 --> 00:47:35.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a place that brings you peace.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And image yourself
in that place.

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And now you're joined
in that place by someone

00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:45.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
you really love.

00:47:48.132 --> 00:47:50.034 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Allow them to sit with you.

00:47:53.971 --> 00:48:00.010 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Look at their face,
and in your mind,

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.846 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
tell them how you
feel about them.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Returning to the place
we're born and raised

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:13.691 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
can be an emotional experience.

00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:19.063 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is for me, because of family
members who are now passed on.

00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:21.599 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
I took my son
Skyler on pilgrimage

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:23.768 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
to pay final respects
to my mom and step

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:27.938 align:middle line:15% position:44% size:78%
dad who died two years earlier.

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:30.441 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
My sisters arranged a
memorial service and burial

00:48:30.441 --> 00:48:32.710 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
of their ashes in
the family plot,

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.213 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
a sweet good bye for
these two beautiful people

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:38.582 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
who played such an
important role in our lives.

00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:46.791 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I'm watching the
people that I love leave,

00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:51.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I am being left behind
by the people that I love.

00:48:51.262 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And then I have
to say the hardest

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.733 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
symptoms there is to say.

00:48:55.733 --> 00:48:59.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I have to say
goodbye, I love you.

00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:02.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
How can it possibly be
goodbye, I love you,

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:05.476 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
in one sentence together?

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:08.279 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:49:27.832 --> 00:49:33.637 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
This is my mother,
I lost her 2004.

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:38.676 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's comforting to me that
I can come and talk to her,

00:49:38.676 --> 00:49:45.783 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
be with her, bring her flowers,
and just practice the way,

00:49:45.783 --> 00:49:47.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
culturally, we do in Mexico.

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Clearly, the cross
cultural evidence

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
suggests that people
all over the world,

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:56.794 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and throughout
history, have thought

00:49:56.794 --> 00:50:00.231 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that consciousness is more
than just our physical being.

00:50:00.231 --> 00:50:02.533 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Different religions,
different cultural groups

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:05.035 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
have created practices
to honor that transition.

00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:19.817 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Many times when you
see your friends that

00:50:19.817 --> 00:50:22.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
do get hit, that are
sitting beside you--

00:50:22.887 --> 00:50:28.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I've had several pilots come
out from under me-- and the fear

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:31.896 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
hits afterward-- that's
when you feel it.

00:50:31.896 --> 00:50:37.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I was down twice, and you
wonder why you make it and maybe

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:38.836 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
the pilot didn't.

00:50:38.836 --> 00:50:44.842 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
I joined the service in 1966,
and I trained as a medic.

00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:48.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And part of your training,
they teach you not

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:50.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to care about your patients.

00:50:50.581 --> 00:50:54.585 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's a job, and that's all they
want to do is to do your job.

00:50:54.585 --> 00:50:58.522 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
But what happens is that when
you have people, especially

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:00.858 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
the men who are coming
in off the field

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:04.595 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
and have been mortally wounded
and not expected to live,

00:51:04.595 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
your own personal feelings
start coming in and they-- you

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.935 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:33%
start caring.

00:51:10.935 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:75%
And there isn't any other way.

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:17.041 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
It's-- for me, it
was just really,

00:51:17.041 --> 00:51:19.877 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
I just had to stop and just--
right now I'm having to do

00:51:19.877 --> 00:51:22.880 align:middle line:15% position:49% size:13%
this.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Just really brings
a tear to your eyes.

00:51:24.882 --> 00:51:26.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We honor the memory of
those who gave their lives

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the service of our country.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And of those others who
have dropped their burdens

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:34.391 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
by the wayside of life.

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:35.626 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:51:43.334 --> 00:51:47.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
When people use art at the end
of life, or people in grief,

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:52.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
as a way of processing
their emotions.

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:59.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
People have used art as a mode
of expressing emotions, grief.

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.753 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Art is a mode of inquiry
into consciousness.

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:07.791 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Now, the moment
of death is known

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:12.262 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to have this experience
of life review.

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:15.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But then when you are
going through these,

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:18.002 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in the passage in
here, it says if you're

00:52:18.002 --> 00:52:21.672 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
passing through all
your experiences

00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:23.173 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
before you totally release.

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:29.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
When I first saw
footage of elephants

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
encountering the remains
of another elephant,

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:34.018 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I was deeply moved.

00:52:34.018 --> 00:52:36.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You could see that they were
very interested, certainly

00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:37.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
curious.

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Where they grieving?

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.959 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Each member of the herd
explored the remains

00:52:41.959 --> 00:52:44.428 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
using their sense
of smell and touch,

00:52:44.428 --> 00:52:47.464 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as if looking for clues
about what happened,

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:49.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or in remembrance of
events in the life

00:52:49.433 --> 00:52:51.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of their departed companion.

00:52:51.969 --> 00:52:56.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You know, grieving is an
important part of the process,

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.442 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and it's necessary.

00:52:58.442 --> 00:53:00.544 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That's how we look at it with
the zoo-- an animal dies,

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:02.379 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but there are still
other animals that

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:05.783 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
are counting on us, and we need
to continue to do our best take

00:53:05.783 --> 00:53:08.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
care of those animals.

00:53:08.786 --> 00:53:13.157 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So if you have members of your
congregation that are in grief,

00:53:13.157 --> 00:53:14.858 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
what do you do?

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:20.230 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
If I really want to quiet
and be present with my heart

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.700 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
and the grief in it,
I walk the labyrinth.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The labyrinth is a
pattern, actually.

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:30.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It's usually about
a 40 foot circle,

00:53:30.007 --> 00:53:34.011 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and it has one path that starts
at the outer edge, and weaves

00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:38.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in a very circuitous way,
eventually into center.

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:40.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And what it is is a
walking meditation where

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:45.022 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you find your natural pace,
and that's pretty rare.

00:53:45.022 --> 00:53:47.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
By walking, the mind
quiets much easier.

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:57.367 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I know we are here to
celebrate David's live,

00:53:57.367 --> 00:54:00.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
but I would not be
honest if I didn't

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:12.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
say that I'm grieving right
now, and my heart is broken.

00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:16.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I grieved over David
as a brother would.

00:54:16.053 --> 00:54:20.357 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Grief is something that
you must go through.

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:26.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You must feel it, embody
it, experience it,

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and it has a life cycle.

00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:32.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It, you know, it reaches a peak,
and then it rains, and then

00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:35.239 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
slowly dissipates as an energy.

00:54:35.239 --> 00:54:43.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And when it dissipates, then
you revive the bond, the love,

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
that was always there.

00:54:45.082 --> 00:54:48.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
OK, and then you have a
relationship with that person.

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:52.422 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And that person doesn't have to
be perceptually right in front

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:54.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of you, they're in
your consciousness

00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and you have access to
them anytime you want.

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:03.901 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I think that everyone has their
own way of getting through it,

00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:08.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but once you have an awareness
that life is eternal,

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:13.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you miss the person-- I
miss my mom, you miss them--

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.845 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but you have a
different relationship,

00:55:14.845 --> 00:55:16.446 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
because they're here.

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:19.816 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You know, they're
around, and it just

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.084 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
becomes a different
relationship.

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.853 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:55:29.126 --> 00:55:30.827 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
In the Christian
tradition, you know,

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:34.498 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
we've had many versions over
the century of death and dying,

00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:37.100 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
but I think certainly
the major tenant

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.804 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
is that there's a life beyond,
after the body, or after death.

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:43.407 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I do really truly
understand that there's

00:55:43.407 --> 00:55:45.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
consciousness beyond
death, there's

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:47.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
consciousness beyond the body.

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:50.681 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And I think that's
what we mean by soul.

00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:53.884 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The soul really can
awaken, we know that.

00:55:53.884 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It's often asleep
for many people.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.024 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And as we become more conscious
of this part of ourselves,

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:04.895 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we really, I think, want to
guard that, protect that,

00:56:04.895 --> 00:56:07.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
grow that, be in love with it.

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:15.672 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
This is a good subject,
because it's universal.

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:17.874 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
Whether you're
Christian, or Buddhist,

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:21.511 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
or Muslim, or Atheist,
everybody meets in that point,

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:24.348 align:middle line:15% position:48% size:43%
we call it death.

00:56:24.348 --> 00:56:27.918 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It says in the Surah that
Prophet, peace be upon him,

00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:32.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
was teaching, he
said, "Blessed the one

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:35.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
who created death and life."

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:39.663 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Usually, you think life and
death, we call this life,

00:56:39.663 --> 00:56:42.199 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and we call, that the
end, you know, this.

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:46.203 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But in that teaching, he
calls this whole life, death,

00:56:46.203 --> 00:56:49.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and he calls the
after death, life.

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.774 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Because this one has a limit.

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:54.211 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You're born and
you have an ending.

00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:55.912 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The other one doesn't
have an ending.

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:56.680 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:02.586 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
I think one of the
great advantages of most

00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:05.222 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
traditional religions
is that they make

00:57:05.222 --> 00:57:07.724 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:70%
people less afraid of death.

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:11.094 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I mean, death's scary,
especially if it's painful.

00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:12.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But they make people
less afraid of death,

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:16.233 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because this is the feeling
that death is a transition.

00:57:16.233 --> 00:57:18.035 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If you're a materialist
or an atheist,

00:57:18.035 --> 00:57:20.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and you believe that
death is the end

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:23.340 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the mind just goes blank,
you may be scared of that,

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.575 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
or scared of growing old.

00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:28.912 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I think that the main
purpose of religion

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:31.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is to make people feel
that their lives are

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:33.250 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
part of something
bigger than themselves,

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:36.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that they're connected
to something much larger

00:57:36.053 --> 00:57:36.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
than themselves.

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:38.755 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And that includes
something larger

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:42.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
than themselves in
relation to death.

00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:44.594 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
If people choose
a spiritual path,

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:47.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
you know, whatever
path that is for them,

00:57:47.164 --> 00:57:49.833 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and only they know what's right
for them, and stick with it,

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:54.271 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
you get these direct experiences
of, on one level, I'm separate,

00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:56.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
you're you, and I'm me, and
another, I'm part of something

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
larger that connects us all.

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:03.980 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
I think that the
universe is becoming

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:07.451 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
self conscious through
the human nervous system.

00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:12.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The [inaudible] that knows is
is an omnipresent, omniscient,

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:16.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
omnipotent being--
the cosmic mind.

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:19.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And our mind is an
aspect of that mind.

00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:22.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
As the great poet Rumi
says, "You're not just

00:58:22.299 --> 00:58:27.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a drop in the ocean, you're
the mighty ocean in the drop."

00:58:27.738 --> 00:58:30.540 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
The Indian sages
had this allegory

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of pots of water
put in the sunlight.

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:37.314 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You take a million pots
and fill them with water,

00:58:37.314 --> 00:58:40.183 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the sun is shining, the
sun is in each one of them,

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
but there's only one sentence.

00:58:42.686 --> 00:58:44.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So, you know, you
take a million people,

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:47.391 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that all our conscious is
only one consciousness.

00:58:51.328 --> 00:58:52.996 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What I know for
sure about death,

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:59.302 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it's just a passageway, a
doorway into ever unfolding

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:01.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of who and what we really are.

00:59:01.405 --> 00:59:03.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And it's nothing
to be afraid of.

00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:06.610 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When the time comes,
it's a common denominator

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:08.578 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that we all pass through.

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:11.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Know that one day, we're
not going to have this body,

00:59:11.348 --> 00:59:15.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so while we're here, in a
human incarnation, we can ask,

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:16.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
how can I serve?

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.054 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
How can I love?

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:21.091 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
How can I cultivate the
gifts that are within me,

00:59:21.091 --> 00:59:22.592 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
and express them?

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:26.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Let me not leave without saying,
and being, and giving all

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:30.901 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that I can say, and be,
and give, while I'm here.

00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:33.804 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I know unequivocally,
without any question,

00:59:33.804 --> 00:59:36.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
there is no such thing as death.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.710 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
No one ever dies, you just
shift from one frequency

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.113 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
into another frequency.

00:59:43.113 --> 00:59:45.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And more importantly, you go
back to where you originally

00:59:45.916 --> 00:59:46.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
came from.

00:59:49.386 --> 00:59:52.389 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
So scientifically, we don't
know if identity, self-awareness

00:59:52.389 --> 00:59:54.558 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:45%
can survive death.

00:59:54.558 --> 00:59:57.127 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:41%
That's more of a
spiritual belief

00:59:57.127 --> 00:59:59.396 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
right now than a
scientific belief.

00:59:59.396 --> 01:00:02.065 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
But I trust my intuition
more than anything,

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.067 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
and my intuition says yes,
this is probably the case.

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:11.942 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
Be aware that we are
part of a continuum.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:15.946 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We were here at the
time of the Big Bang.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:20.150 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I never died, from the time
of Big Bang, I was here.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:24.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And I will never die, I'll
be here for the eternity.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:27.190 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I only change form.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The moment you realize
that, then you not afraid.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:36.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The dead are not under
the earth, you know?

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:41.137 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
They're in the water, they're in
the woods, they're in the fire,

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:44.007 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they're in the air, they're
in the breast of the woman,

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:46.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
they're in the child
that is crying.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:48.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
The dead are not dead.

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:54.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The key to the conquest of death
is to find out who you are.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:56.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As long as you confused with
your body and your mind,

01:00:56.887 --> 01:01:00.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
you're bamboozled
by superstition, OK?

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:03.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Because the body and the
mind are dying anyway,

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.362 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
all the time, OK?

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:08.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I don't have the same thoughts
I had when I was a teenager.

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:10.467 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
I don't have the
same personality.

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:13.169 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I don't have the same emotions.

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
If you're the string
of beads, there's

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:18.808 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a thread that strings
together the string of beads.

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:22.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So when you think of the beads
as the memories and the string

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:26.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
as what the memories
are strung on,

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:32.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that's you-- the string on which
the memories are strung on.

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:34.491 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And if you can go
to the deeper level

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:38.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and be grounded there now,
you've conquered death.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:42.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Because you realize that
death is an illusion.

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:47.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's actually the movement
of space time events.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:54.644 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In coma, it's a
different universe.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:59.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I had no sense of
concern, no anxiety.

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:02.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I just found myself exploring.

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:05.488 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It was an area of
complete curiosity.

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:07.524 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
It was boundless.

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:11.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Vista, after vista, after vista.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:15.532 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Every environment was
beautiful, one environment

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:16.866 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
leading seamlessly to the next.

01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:23.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The landscapes and
places I visited,

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I knew them well, although I
had never been to them before.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:30.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The people I met, I felt
I'd known them for as long

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:34.250 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as I could remember, although
I'd not met them before,

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:37.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which is why I feel that we have
one consciousness that we all

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:41.224 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
share, in complete connection
with everything and everyone.

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:44.494 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Very beautiful.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:48.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And whether we recover,
whether we wake up or not,

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:53.803 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
there's no cause for fear
when we change-- when we

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:55.805 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
move into some other existence.

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:04.914 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
On the day when death will
knock at your door, what will

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:07.283 align:middle line:15% position:50% size:41%
you give to him?

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:11.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Oh, I will set before my guest
the full vessel of my life.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:15.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I will never let him
go with empty hands.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:21.598 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
All the sweet vintage of all my
autumn days and summer nights.

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:25.502 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
All the earnings and
gleanings of my busy life

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:29.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
will I place before Him
at the close of my days.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:33.777 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now the day has dawned, and the
lamp that lit my dark corner

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:37.280 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
is out.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.350 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A summons has come, and
I'm ready for my journey.

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:56.499 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
