00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a degree in
physics from UC Berkeley,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and I've had a lifelong
fascination with the true

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:90%
nature of reality.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And I actually believe
that's probably

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
what propelled me to have some
of the experiences that I had,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
which demonstrated that
there are sometimes

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
these remarkable shifts
in reality that can occur.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And that what we
call quantum jumps

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:84%
are not just
something that happens

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
on the quantum so-called
scale, but they

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
can happen at any level
of physical reality.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I had a fairly normal
stretch of time

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
in my life when I was
doing normal research.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I had a job in the
banking industry.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
When things started
changing was around 1994

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
when I started really noticing
remarkable changes in reality.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
That was following a
Kundalini awakening,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
which was a change
in my inner energy.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like just being
flooded with so much energy

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:90%
that it was incredible.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes seeing
so much light,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I felt blinded even
with my eyes shut.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
light around me.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
During it and then also after, I
was noticing that I'd sometimes

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
be spontaneously aware of things
happening in remote locations,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
like spontaneous remote
viewing or 360-degree vision,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that I could see all the way
around me at quite a distance

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and outside the
walls of the house.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:90%
So it was really startling.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And then ever since then,
I've had the ability

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
at times to have exactly
the same experience again.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't test it so much by
doing those kinds of things

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of going to see if
what I saw was real,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
but my daughters would
try to sneak up on me,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and they never could,
especially after that.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It was just impossible,
because I could see them

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:90%
before they got to me.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I've had other things happen
where if I'm daydreaming,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I've been observed
in two locations.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm in one place
where I'm daydreaming,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
but I'm observed somewhere else.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a bilocation
that can occur.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
One morning when my
daughters were quite young,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go wake them up each
morning so they'd go to school.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were too small to
open the curtain in their room.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:90%
It was too heavy.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.845 align:middle line:84%
So I would go down
the hall, open--

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
well, I turned the light on,
and then I'd walk to the window

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and I'd say, good
morning, girls.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'd open this very heavy
curtain that would then go up.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.408 align:middle line:84%
And one morning, it
was a cold morning.

00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to get
out of bed right away.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was still
thinking about dreams

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:90%
and daydreaming a little bit.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:10%
And in my mind, I was
daydreaming that I walked down

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:10%
the hall, turned
on the light, said,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.977 align:middle line:10%
good morning, girls,
opened the curtain.

00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well, wouldn't
it be great if it was that easy?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But then I hear noises
from their room.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.043 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
running around the house,

00:03:15.043 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, Mom?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Mom?

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
They said, Mom, what are
you doing back in bed?

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I never got out of bed.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.452 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:90%
You just saw me?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, where was I?

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.345 align:middle line:90%
And they said, in our room.

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm jumping out
of bed and I'm running

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:90%
to go see what happened.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And their light is on, the
window curtain is open,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and nobody else
could have done that.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:90%
It only could have been me.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know I didn't, so I
experienced that I'm in bed.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:90%
They experienced I was there.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So that was what a
bilocation felt like.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And for me, daydreaming and just
sort of wishing I was there.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.523 align:middle line:84%
The other time it
happened, I was

00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
daydreaming and wishing
I was somewhere,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
and someone saw me there.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:90%
So I've done this twice.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.493 align:middle line:90%
And it feels great.

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just feeling like, ah,
I wish I could be there.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:90%
And then guess what?

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you are.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:10%
So after this
experience happened,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:10%
I immediately looked up
to see what could explain

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:10%
these kind of experiences.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that
throughout history, people have

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:90%
had these kinds of experiences.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite normal.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's something that
is considered often

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:10%
something that's typical
for a shaman or someone who

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:10%
is the healer for a
community, because people

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:10%
who have that much
energy can help

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:10%
to be a conduit for
changes in reality.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that really
got my attention

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
about how you can change
reality, or how all of us

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:90%
do that.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:84%
For me, the most
interesting thing

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that I learned about physics was
quantum physics at UC Berkeley.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I loved my classes in
that subject matter.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And after my
Kundalini awakening,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I came to realize that a
lot of the answer to what

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is the nature of
reality seems to be

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
held in the mysteries of quantum
physics, which, although we can

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
work out the mathematics
and we can solve equations

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and we can even build atomic
bombs and nuclear power plants,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
we don't exactly think the
way quantum physics shows us

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:90%
that the world really operates.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And what's so wonderful and
mysterious about the quantum

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
physics and quantum
mechanics is that when

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:84%
we look to see, what are these
building blocks of matter,

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:84%
we find that at the very
center of the very smallest

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
inseparable, indivisible
particle, which

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
would be like an
electron, if you can't

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
get any smaller
than that, then that

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:90%
qualifies as a quantum particle.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Those little
electrons can actually

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
be observed to be in one place,
and then it's like they vanish.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
They can change in energy level
and show up instantly somewhere

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And they do other things also.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
They can be connected with
one another, entangled.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And when one is affected
and its spin is up

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and the other one's spin is
down, if you observe one,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you make
an observation on one

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
that's entangled with
another, they both

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:90%
flip at the same time.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
These entanglements
are now being

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:84%
tested in laboratory
conditions around the world

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
as people are building
quantum computers.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
There's been a race,
like a gold rush

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to see how fast we can
find this information

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and these new technologies.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So diamonds and
large things that you

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
can observe in your hands
are being entangled.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They're showing
entanglements that

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
are holding together at
greater and greater distances.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So we can tell obviously
throughout the universe

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
there can be an entanglement
with one particle right here

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and another particle in an
entirely different galaxy,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:90%
great distances away.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to be no
limitation on the distance.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
When we look at space
and time, then we

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
start recognizing that humans
have a unique experience

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:90%
with space and time.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And what we think is
true for everything

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
may not be true for
everything, but may more

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
be a facet of our
humanity and the way

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.655 align:middle line:84%
that we are set up
to observe reality.

00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The Mandela effect
is a term that

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
was coined in the year 2010
by a blogger, Fiona Broome.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And she and a bunch
of people noticed

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that they remembered
that the gentleman named

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Nelson Mandela from South
Africa had died before 2010.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
They were all surprised and glad
that he was alive, but really

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
surprised because they
remembered clearly

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:90%
that he had previously died.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So this was the first
time that the idea

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
of a whole bunch of people
remembering something

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%
differently really caught hold.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:10%
And it became very popular
on Reddit, that website,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:10%
as well as the
Mandela effect website

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:10%
that Fiona Broome started.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this
is a phenomenon

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
that I've been tracking
since the 1990s.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It's what I would
call reality shift.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was a term that was
coined by PMH Atwater when

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
she wrote an earlier book that
I didn't know about at the time.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So I found that the
word reality shift

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
seemed to explain there
are a bunch of people

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
that notice someone died,
and now they're alive again.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I noticed Larry Hagman,
and I wrote about him

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:90%
in my book "Reality Shifts."

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
He's an actor from
the TV show "Dallas."

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So I described that lots of
people noticed he had died,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and then he was alive again.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a phenomenon
that's very interesting,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
because the closer you are to
Larry Hagman or Nelson Mandela,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
the less likely
you are to notice

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that particular
individual had died

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and then they'd
come alive again.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It's more likely to
happen when it's someone

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:90%
that you don't see very often.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
think about them much.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They're on the periphery
of your awareness.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:90%
They're not the focal point.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:90%
They're off to the side.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So you know about them, and
then when you hear about it,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
it's like, wow.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So that was the beginning
of this Mandela effect.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
It has now exploded in terms
of lots of other examples.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:10%
Books, movies, you
name it, products.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] All kinds of things.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes
to things like we

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
notice products changing,
that can be confusing,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
because of course, first
you want to make sure,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
was it really some
kind of a change?

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Did the company make a change?

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Once you eliminate
that possibility,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
then the only thing
left is that when

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
you're the one that noticed
the change, unless you

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
think you're going crazy
or getting forgetful.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Usually, this is not the case.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Usually, people that
notice these things

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:90%
are very observant.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:10%
They're getting an
opportunity to experience

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:10%
these alternate histories.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:10%
And what's happening
is one group

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:10%
of people would notice it
like with Nelson Mandela.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
The ones who don't live in South
Africa like myself and others,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
they remember he died
when he was incarcerated.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:90%
He was still in jail.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:90%
And it seemed such a tragedy.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:90%
It seemed very sad.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
a big hullabaloo.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:84%
There were lots of things
going on with his widow

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and the government and
trying to work things out

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:90%
with the estate.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's not
confabulation, which

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is what some people say
the Mandela effect is.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, you're
just making this up.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But why would so many
people make that up?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
As far as how it
works, I don't know.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not going
to just say, like,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:84%
oh, I've got a theory
that explains everything.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I am more
like a biologist,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:84%
back when biologists
would travel the world

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to see if they could categorize
what kind of birds and animals

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:90%
they're observing.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:10%
Just like when Charles Darwin
is on the "Beagle," that ship,

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.960 align:middle line:10%
and he's traveling
across the world,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:10%
that's what I've been doing with
these reality shift examples.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm still
gathering information.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's possible that
what we're looking at

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
is something that's similar
to a holographic multiverse.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
holographic component

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
connected and it's one,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:90%
like the pages in a book.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But each page might signify
another parallel reality, which

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:90%
could be side by side by side.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can jump
from one page to another.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Where everybody else is,
that gets to the question

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And how can each
of us hold ideas

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that might be from
some other reality?

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Then we need to start taking a
look at what some people might

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
call are these
anomalous experiences.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.887 align:middle line:84%
But to me, I think they're
pretty common experiences.

00:11:42.887 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
seeing more evidence

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
of this sort of quantum
behavior in all of biology,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.280 align:middle line:90%
in all of life.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:10%
There are an infinity
of possibilities

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:10%
that at every moment we make a
choice, we're looking at that

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:10%
and feeling that.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And so people who've had
near-death experiences

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
or are lucid dreamers or have
had a Kundalini experience,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:84%
they're much more keenly
aware of this process,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and they can feel
when they're in it.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
remarkable, because you

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
can tell that there's a reality
that's always been there.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much that you're
creating it or calling it

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It's more that you
are recognizing

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that the truth of who
you are is consciousness.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And as consciousness, you're
capable of making that jump

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:90%
into any reality.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Which sounds
incredible, but people

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:84%
who have come back
from being dead

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
will sometimes report that's
exactly what they did.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they were able
to become fully healed when they

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:90%
were extremely sick before.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, most of us do
experience these quantum jumps.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think much
of it when it happens.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we are just
happy that it happens.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking right
now of the example where

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:84%
if you need to wake up and
you have trouble waking up

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and you will yourself
to get out of bed

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:84%
on a cold morning,
that willpower,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:90%
that moment is an example of it.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound very
impressive, I know.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And then one that's a little bit
more impressive but still not

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:90%
that impressive-- so it's easy.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
These are a little baby
step quantum jumps.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Another good
one that's easy to do is

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:10%
if you're starting to catch a
cold and you can tell yourself,

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:10%
I can't get sick today--

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:10%
and I think we've all had that
experience where it's like, no.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:90%
This is not happening.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I have to stay well today.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you notice, after
I thought that, I felt fine.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.413 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
that experience.

00:13:38.413 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And then one that's
scientifically

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:84%
proven in the
laboratories right now

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:84%
is where you know for
sure that you did not

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:90%
get a good night's sleep.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was a
neighbor fighting or lots

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.087 align:middle line:90%
of noise, traffic accidents.

00:13:50.087 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Something going on that
was so noisy there's

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:84%
no way you got a
good night's sleep.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
It was the worst
night's sleep ever.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
In the morning,
all you need to do

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
is keep telling
yourself over and over

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and over again until
you start believing it,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful
night's sleep last night.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep
repeating that, just

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:84%
starting to believe
it, convince yourself.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Then what's
scientifically proven

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is that you will behave on
all sorts of cognitive tests,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:84%
physical tests just the same as
if you'd had that good night's

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:90%
sleep, and you'll feel better.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So these are things
that are easy.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:90%
On the other extreme--

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
because I like to look
at the entire bandwidth,

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the whole breadth
and depth of it.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:84%
At the other extreme that's
going to start sounding crazy,

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I've heard from so many people
that have instantaneously

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.240 align:middle line:84%
been teleported to
safety when they've

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.082 align:middle line:84%
been in an accident, when
their car is about to crash.

00:14:38.082 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
happened, but somehow they

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:90%
got thrown clear of the vehicle.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It's as if they went
right through it.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the oncoming
vehicle never hit their car,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
but now is on the other side,
and there never was an impact,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
never was a collision.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
quantum tunneling,

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening with a
Mack truck and a car, vehicles

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that weigh thousands and
thousands of kilograms.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It is extremely heavy.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no
way to explain that.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:90%
And these things happen a lot.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
There are lots and lots
of examples of that,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:84%
as well as instantaneous
healing of everything

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:84%
from broken bones, which are
not supposed to heal instantly,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:90%
to cancer going away.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what
the healers are doing,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.115 align:middle line:84%
they're able to enter a
dream with their client

00:15:23.115 --> 00:15:23.915 align:middle line:90%
or with a person.

00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:10%
And when I say dream, that's
recognizing that all of reality

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:10%
is like a dream.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:10%
And this is what you hear
if you study the Upanishads

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:10%
and some Indian writing.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you,
reality is a dream.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you enter the dream with
someone, then you share that.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can enter the dream and
help the person find that dream

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:90%
reality where they are healthy.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly what
healers are able to do,

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.103 align:middle line:90%
is to go there with someone.

00:15:51.103 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And then when they come
back on that journey--

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and it might be with drumming
or it might be with chanting.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
These are what indigenous
peoples the world over

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:90%
have used as a--

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
these are ancient
technologies that

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:84%
are very effective at
implementing quantum jumps.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.468 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason
most people don't

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
think that these
things are happening

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
or don't think they're observing
them is primarily because they

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:90%
don't believe it's possible.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, there's an
open-mindedness issue,

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:84%
because once you believe,
well, it's possible,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
then you need to even be
even more open-minded so

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that those kind of
experiences could happen.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.657 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't think it
would make a difference,

00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
but it really does, because
our brains and our minds

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
are set up to observe what we
train ourselves to look for.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not looking for
these kinds of quantum jumps,

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
reality shifts, Mandela
effects, then we

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:90%
don't really notice them.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Or we assume, first of all,
that we've made a mistake.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:84%
We think, well, maybe
I'm misremembering that.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some reason that
when I talk about my childhood

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
with my family,
they tell a story

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that I know didn't happen, and
they seem so convinced it did.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
We just dismiss those signs
and those pieces of evidence

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that would suggest
that we're all

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
experiencing
alternate histories,

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and that it's quite normal.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So when people assume that
we're just going through

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
like watching a
movie on the screen,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and we want the illusion that
that movie is flowing evenly,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's just as
good as real life.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we're watching
frames in a movie flashing.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot more
like stair steps,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
like taking step by
step by step by step.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's also
what nature is doing.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll be able to start
seeing more evidence of it

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
by recognizing that this
can and does happen.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
things that I would

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.600 align:middle line:84%
expect to find such as
when scientists have a bias

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
to begin with to expect
a certain result,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that's the result
they tend to get.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of our
Nobel-winning scientists

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:90%
are noticing that too.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
They tend to think that there's
some sort of observer bias,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
but I'm considering it's a
deeper problem, that actually

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
we can change results just by
expecting something different.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we can do
that on any scale.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:10%
I like people who are
skeptical about this,

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:10%
because I think that's
good to be skeptical,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:10%
to be a good skeptic.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And open-minded but
questioning, like, OK.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make any sense.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
This is not what I learned.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So how can this
possibly be true?

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And for them, I would suggest
looking at placebo studies.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Placebo is a word that
means, I shall please.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:10%
And in World War II, there
were doctors in England

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:10%
that were running
out of medication,

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:10%
and so they would basically
give the soldiers who

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:10%
were in a great deal of pain
an injection with just water

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:10%
and some salt in it.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's just a saline solution.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And they would notice in
large numbers of people,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:90%
they would feel better.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:84%
The doctors wanted
to do something.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
When they run out of
medicine on the front line,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:90%
that's a terrible feeling.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is why, if
you're wondering, well,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that sounds unethical, why would
doctors do that, that's why.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And right now in surveys
that are conducted

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:84%
across all of the hospitals in
America, a majority of doctors

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
absolutely will prescribe
placebos for their patients,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes they
don't have anything

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.470 align:middle line:84%
that they know for
sure will work,

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and so they say,
well, take this.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:90%
We think it will help.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And the very fact that that's
happening, that there's

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
this placebo effect, which
benefits some 20% to 30%

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.370 align:middle line:90%
of the people that take it--

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, that
number is going up.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:90%
It's been increasing.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the placebo effect--

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just sugar pills
and salt solution injections.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It's also a placebo surgery,
and just sometimes instruction

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:84%
given from a person to
someone taking a test--

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:84%
you've got this, you're
going to do great--

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:90%
the test score will go up 30%.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're typically seeing
about a 30% improvement.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Then of people like
myself who have

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:84%
faith in the placebo effect
or faith in a greater power,

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:84%
then you can get
results up to 70%.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:90%
70%.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is so much
more than pretty much

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
any other pharmaceutical
can claim.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what I invite skeptics
to look at and study.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at what Harvard
is doing with their placebo

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
research center,
because skeptics often

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:84%
want to know, where can I
go to look at a university

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
or someone I can trust to
see what kind of results

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:90%
they're getting?

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's
doing real studies.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:90%
They're not falsifying results.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They're using a gold standard or
a platinum standard with regard

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:90%
to double-blind studies.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And that would be Harvard,
and other universities

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:90%
doing similar work.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Each of us is basically
the center of our universe,

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and we do come together so
we can feel the consciousness

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:90%
of others with us.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But we're capable of actually
experiencing almost anything

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:90%
that we totally believe in.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.773 align:middle line:10%
And if people doubt
this and they say,

00:20:58.773 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:10%
well, that can't be
right, because otherwise I

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:10%
would have won the lottery,
and so on and so forth,

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:10%
that gets into the energy
body again and the fact

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:10%
that we're not
totally in our brains,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:10%
as much as people
wish they were.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We think with our hearts.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:90%
We think with our guts.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring this
whole thing together,

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
then you'll start noticing
you've got subconscious

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, and you get
subconscious thoughts

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
that may be much more
powerful than anything

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:90%
you think that you want.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
choosing a reality

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that you want to go into,
then you're acting as if.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
This is something that our
American psychologist William

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
James talked about.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can absolutely
program it like a GPS exactly,

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:84%
just knowing that
if I was successful,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
then I would need
to have this done.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:90%
I would need to be saying this.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I would need to wear this
and have these friends

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
and do these things.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:10%
And so if you start
doing all of that,

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:10%
then you can definitely start
moving into that reality.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:10%
We can have very confusing
beliefs about some things

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:10%
such as money.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote a book about
that, "High Energy Money,"

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:10%
to help people understand
what those kind of thoughts

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:10%
might be that could
be tripping them up

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:10%
so they could take a look at
the thought and then reverse it.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Usually, if you've got something
that's holding you back

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
like money is evil,
you might as well

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
believe the opposite of
that, because it's just

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
a random belief.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it's
true to just believe

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, money is evil.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can flip that
one around and say,

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%
money helps us do good
things in the world.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.585 align:middle line:84%
Money can be the key to
sharing energy with others.

00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way of
setting yourself

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
free from judging
things in ways that

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
are more representative
of our own shadow side

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
than what's really
so-called out there.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a good question.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:84%
How does consciousness
relate to the material world?

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I've noticed
is that consciousness

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:90%
seems to be preeminent.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the dominant thing.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And at least that's
my observation,

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:90%
because I am consciousness.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's my human experience.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it's
like to not be conscious.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.667 align:middle line:90%
But it's one of those things.

00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you define consciousness?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
That's important to know
what the description of it

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
is before you start
looking at, how

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:90%
does it interact with matter?

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:10%
And the truth is, that's
still an open question.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So even the experts in
the field of consciousness

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:84%
are arguing about, well,
what exactly is it?

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is not where
physicists wanted to go.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They were hoping that
physics could be something

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:90%
that's completely measurable.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The idea of consciousness
is not measurable,

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way to predict
the presence, absence,

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.780 align:middle line:84%
or a change in consciousness
in any given experiment.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Yet now with the
observer, consciousness

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:90%
has entered the picture.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is more
than the neurons.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So when we try to do the neuron
mapping like they're doing

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and they can map the
brain and the networks,

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.925 align:middle line:84%
and then supposedly we should
know everything, but we don't.

00:23:58.925 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:84%
It's more like seeing that
you can see the roads,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
the traffic patterns,

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and you don't
understand why things

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.430 align:middle line:90%
are happening the way they do.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And memories are not
stored in a place.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, oh, there's the
neuron that stored that memory.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:90%
They move around.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.455 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at the
way the brain functions,

00:24:15.455 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:84%
it's very disappointing
in terms of finding a way

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to lock consciousness into
matter that has not succeeded.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
The reason science cannot prove
that consciousness is produced

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
by the brain is we don't know
how to measure consciousness.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And science can only
handle what it can predict.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It can only-- which
means you have

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.690 align:middle line:90%
to be able to measure something.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to tell if
it's there, if it's changing,

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:90%
if it's gone.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't do
that-- we still can't

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:90%
do that with consciousness.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
We rely entirely upon asking
someone, do you feel conscious?

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at things
like, are they awake

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:90%
or are they asleep?

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:90%
We can look at brainwave states.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:84%
We can measure some things,
but it doesn't really

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:90%
get to the heart of the issue.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:84%
That's not surprising
to people who

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.390 align:middle line:84%
have been meditating for
centuries like the Tibetan

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Buddhists.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
They understand consciousness
at a different level,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:84%
because they're going
into it through meditation

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and direct experience.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's more the
right way to explore this.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
What I'm noticing about
material world and consciousness

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
is that to the degree
that we believe

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:84%
the material world is
real-- this is really

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:90%
important-- we buy into that.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:90%
We start thinking, OK.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Gravity works.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
My world is the
way I think it is,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and my assumptions are true.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
We're social animals,
so we collectively

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.730 align:middle line:90%
share consciousness.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big idea too.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:84%
How is consciousness
something that sometimes we

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
feel that we have a
collaborative feeling?

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Where does this feeling
of all of these emotions

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:84%
like love and these
feelings of forgiveness

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:90%
that we have or gratitude?

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.630 align:middle line:84%
These are very
powerful emotions.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So when we combine our
consciousness with our family,

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
our friends, our
colleagues, and we

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
don't want to go too
far away from what

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:84%
we know everybody
would agree with,

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:84%
then we're kind of anchored
down to a certain level

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:90%
of what's possible.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:84%
We can let go of that when we're
in a life-or-death situation

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
or when we just want to
explore consciousness

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
through something like lucid
dreaming or meditation.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Then and only then can you
actually make that big jump

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.020 align:middle line:90%
to something else.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
What's really happening
is you're stepping

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:90%
outside of the situation.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So what always
happens when you do

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
a quantum jump is recognizing
that you are consciousness.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
What we tend to do is
get stuck in believing

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we're in a situation,
like we have a problem.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
That person won't let us do
something or something bad

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
happened, and we think
we're in this little world.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And to make a quantum
jump, we need to step back.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.522 align:middle line:84%
You need to recognize
that you are consciousness

00:26:52.522 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and that you're
observing all this.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.522 align:middle line:84%
You have feelings,
you have thoughts,

00:26:55.522 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
but you're not your thoughts
and you're not your feelings.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's becoming mindful
and then becoming energized.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
step is exactly that.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just choose where you want
to go next, and accept that

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.835 align:middle line:84%
as the dream that
you wish to live.

00:27:09.835 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the dream you
want to come true.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:10%
So the most
important thing to do

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:10%
when you are going on the
path, this journey of reality

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:10%
shifting and quantum
jumping, I believe

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:10%
is to become more
spiritual, actually.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] To become
a better person.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely important
to do that, to be more kind.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
if you don't do

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that is you're disregarding
some of yourself,

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to pull you off
course, absolutely every time.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're selfish and
you think, I just want good--

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I want a good life, I want
a good material world,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.763 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about spirituality,
you can try it that way.

00:27:46.763 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
recommend anybody try it

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that way, because
things tend to go,

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- and I've seen things
go wrong, because what happens

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
is those parts of ourselves
that are subconscious, that

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:84%
are maybe greedy and so
forth, if you haven't

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
come to a place of
acceptance and forgiveness

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.450 align:middle line:84%
for yourself and
others, you'll be

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.580 align:middle line:84%
going through the
same cycles of events.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're usually not good.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:90%
So you need to clean things up.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.020 align:middle line:84%
One way, as we were talking
about how to make that quantum

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.640 align:middle line:90%
jump, is to step back.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And one way to
instantly step back

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:84%
is to feel an emotion
such as gratitude.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Because instantly,
then you can feel it.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.270 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling
true gratitude,

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
it's just this amazing
experience for me.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like I can
feel my energy expanding.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.850 align:middle line:90%
I feel more at peace.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The things that have been
troubling me seem like they're

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:90%
not so important.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous change
that occurs energetically,

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:84%
as well as with the focus of
my attention, which goes from--

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
usually being humans, we're
looking at, what's wrong?

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:90%
What's not going right?

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
What's the thing that's a
little bit off right now?

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:90%
We tend to focus on that.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But instead, by
bringing your attention

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.785 align:middle line:84%
back to what's really good,
what are the blessings?

00:28:56.785 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
What are the things that
mean the most to us,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:90%
that we're grateful for?

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Then we get this boost of energy
and also a boost of a focus.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.345 align:middle line:84%
It definitely brings
us back on track.

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And forgiveness does this too.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Some people have trouble
with forgiveness,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.750 align:middle line:84%
but if you can do it,
that's a good one.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Forgive yourself
and forgive others.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.353 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness can be
easier when you recognize

00:29:20.353 --> 00:29:22.770 align:middle line:84%
like in "A Course of Miracles"
that there's nothing to it,

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is already a
pure being of consciousness

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and a pure being
of light and love,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:90%
and that's who we really are.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And we tend to forget that.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people have trouble
really feeling like, really?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.505 align:middle line:84%
That seems-- that can be
a stretch for some people

00:29:38.505 --> 00:29:40.188 align:middle line:90%
to go that far.

00:29:40.188 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you can do
it, it's wonderful,

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.120 align:middle line:84%
because the benefit
is phenomenal.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
when we don't forgive,

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:84%
we don't notice
that we're getting

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
pulled down with these
negative feelings of something

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:90%
went wrong.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And if only that hadn't
happened, if only

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:90%
they didn't do that.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you let go of it,
it's also very expansive

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
to go into forgiveness
and gratitude and love.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Those are very powerful.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.880 align:middle line:84%
One thing we can do is
putting yourself back

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the
story, because sometimes we

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
get caught thinking
we're a victim

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.020 align:middle line:84%
or we think something
has happened to us.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And the way to
break free of that,

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:84%
it's basically a drama
triangle, because then it's

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:84%
just playing games and
pretending that you're

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
wearing the role of victim and
someone else is the villain,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.400 align:middle line:90%
and there might be a rescuer.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But when you realize, that
doesn't make any sense.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to retrain
my subconscious that I

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.300 align:middle line:90%
can do whatever I want to do.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I can be the hero
in my own story.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But not the kind of hero
where I'm fighting evil.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Just recognizing that I can
bring about changes that I

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:90%
want to see in the world.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I can be that
change in the world.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you really feel like
you're doing what you love,

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.980 align:middle line:90%
then you can come fully alive.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find people
that are excited to be

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:90%
with you, doing that too.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
This idea of shifting the Earth
with shared intent, with shared

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and the reason
I keep calling it dreaming

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is because when we
think intention,

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:90%
we tend to stay in our heads.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
When we dream, we dream
with our fullness of being.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And in our dreams
we can take action,

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.833 align:middle line:84%
which we can then feel
and give voice to,

00:31:19.833 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and then we can think.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the way to bring
about the biggest changes

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:90%
that we need to make.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And so sharing a
dream is actually

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:90%
the way to transform the world.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And sharing a positive
dream, looking

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:84%
at how good things
can get, which

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.180 align:middle line:84%
is a question that I
like to leave open-ended

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:84%
so we don't assume that
we know what it is.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And that way, you know
that good can prevail,

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:90%
that good will be there.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And it matches the
fact that we live

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in such a fine-tuned
universe right now,

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.050 align:middle line:90%
which is ridiculously unlikely.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So some people say this is
proof that God exists, and I

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.130 align:middle line:90%
tend to think so too.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I also think that we can
definitely see evidence

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:06.680 align:middle line:84%
in that, that we're already
winning against whatever

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
may seem like it's impossible
or unsolvable or too

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:90%
difficult or too evil.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:84%
The idea that what
resists persists

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:84%
is really central to this idea
of dreaming a new reality.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're fighting something,
it seems like it gets stronger

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.520 align:middle line:90%
or it hangs on--

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.490 align:middle line:84%
in America, we have a war on
drugs that never seems to end.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.817 align:middle line:84%
We have so many wars,
so many conflicts.

00:32:28.817 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like every
time we look around,

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:90%
there's a new enemy.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But that's not really
the way to move forward

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:90%
in a positive manner.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:84%
The way to move
forward positively

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.390 align:middle line:84%
is to find what you are
grateful for, what you love,

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and to bring more
of that into being.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's very obvious,
but it's something

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:90%
that I think we're learning.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of that
global awakening right now.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe we do have
free will, but then this

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:84%
comes back to that
question of consciousness

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and who am I, which is
like the ultimate question.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So on some levels, if I
factor in the infinite,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:84%
eternal part of
myself that was here

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:84%
before I was born, that
will be here after I die,

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.780 align:middle line:84%
then that part of me has
an awareness of what's

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
going on that to me
in my day-to-day life

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.340 align:middle line:84%
might feel like I'm living
a path of fate or something,

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:84%
like things are meant
to be a certain way.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But we definitely do
experience free will every time

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:90%
we can make a choice and choose.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Like, all these realities exist.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's try that one.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Then we can give it a try.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to neuroscience,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.670 align:middle line:84%
what scientists are
noticing strangely,

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
it gets back to that
question of time,

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:84%
because we're noticing
sometimes that we've

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:84%
made a decision
before we've even

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
felt the input to our senses,
which seems impossible.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But as far as my
own experience, I

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.858 align:middle line:84%
feel like we do have free
will and that it matters.

00:33:58.858 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the most
important thing right now

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:84%
for us as humans to deal with
all the problems on the planet

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and to help each
other, is to recognize

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
the level of expansiveness
that we can attain

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and the way that we can play
with these different realities.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.435 align:middle line:90%
And also share consciousness.

00:34:15.435 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:84%
As we were talking about
healing someone else

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and sharing a dream, we
can pull each other up

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.170 align:middle line:84%
by sharing positive
dreams with one another.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
extremely empowering

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.639 align:middle line:84%
and can pull us out of
things that look impossible.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:31.853 align:middle line:84%
We don't live in a
linear timeline at all.

00:34:31.853 --> 00:34:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that is one of the
biggest things for people

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to realize, is that you're
able to see what you might call

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:90%
a miracle in a moment.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.219 align:middle line:90%
Anything could happen.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:84%
And to recognize that
there's always a possibility

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:90%
for phenomenal transformation.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And people who have
been aware of this--

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and even if you're skeptical,
you can still get this to work.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So next time you're in
a difficult situation--

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.857 align:middle line:84%
maybe the car is out of
gas or you're stranded

00:34:56.857 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:84%
or you have no money
or you lost your purse,

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:84%
or whatever happened,
some sort of bad news--

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.800 align:middle line:90%
just take a moment.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Meditate.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Center yourself.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And then just imagine, well,
how good could this get?

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And imagine, just
like it's a dream,

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.890 align:middle line:84%
like you're going
into that daydream

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
walk into that reality.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so many people have
had phenomenal success,

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.760 align:middle line:90%
doing exactly that.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And I share stories
about this in my book

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.077 align:middle line:84%
"Quantum Jumps," because it
happens to so many people.

00:35:26.077 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're skeptical,
even if you think, well,

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that's ridiculous,
how could this

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.130 align:middle line:84%
possibly work, this is
impossible-- the car's

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.980 align:middle line:84%
out of gas, my wallet's
gone, whatever.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:84%
They've told me no,
they said they lost

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.250 align:middle line:90%
my order, whatever happened.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
imagine, well, what

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
if there's just some chance
that maybe things are OK?

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:90%
There's a slim chance somehow.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:90%
Just believe in it.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Dream it.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And the dreaming is
so important, again,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.440 align:middle line:84%
because you're activating
the fullness of your being.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.440 align:middle line:84%
The trouble that some
people have with intention

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.850 align:middle line:84%
is they're just thinking
with their heads,

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:90%
and that doesn't work.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really get
a full embodiment of it,

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:01.710 align:middle line:90%
of all of you.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
People who feel like
they're absolutely stuck,

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:84%
they are perfect proof of
this process in action.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's true for
all of us, anybody

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:90%
who is a human right now.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's me too, you know?

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's perfect.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:84%
We all get to some point
where we believe, like,

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:84%
well, this is too much,
or this is too difficult.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But at least I
know on some level

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:90%
that that's not really true.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I've
grown up in a society,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.300 align:middle line:84%
on a world, on a planet
where that's been

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:90%
the prevailing belief so far.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.795 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that that's
changing right now,

00:36:36.795 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and more and more
people are waking up.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:90%
