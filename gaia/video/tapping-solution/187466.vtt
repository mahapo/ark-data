00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I've worked so hard
to be strong and healthy.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
this happened to me.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
>> I have fibromyalgia, and
I've had it for 15 years now--

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed for 15 years.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been suffering
from insomnia since July.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's, to me,
almost worse than--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding it almost worse
than the chemotherapy.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought
with the chemotherapy

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd have an end date,
but the insomnia

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
has just made it almost
worse than the chemo for me.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> If a client comes to me and
says, on a scale of 1 to 10,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
my life is a 3, my next
question is, why so high?

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And they say, what do you mean?

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.335 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, why
isn't it a 2 or a 1?

00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well, yeah,
I guess it's not a 1.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, my son's
really a great kid,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm having a
good time with him.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And my mother's been supporting
me through the divorce,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:90%
and he gets good grades.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So what would it take to
move it to a 4 for you?

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I've tried lots of things.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But each time I
had surgery done,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like, oh, you
got a 40%, 60% chance.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, a 60% chance
of being better.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.725 align:middle line:84%
I was always in
the 40%, you know?

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh god, emotion.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:90%
The pain of her loss.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I just-- it's very hard.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I lost a woman that
I love so much.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:90%
I lost a very beautiful woman.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The accident took place about
five minutes from the bridge,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
Raquel's life ended.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
She was dealing with
the pain every day.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
On and on, it doesn't turn off.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm trying to find
something positive in each day.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Because there's just how much
of that fear-driven unknown,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:90%
what lies ahead.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We're seeing that there
are some direct influences

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
on the body's physical health
that's directly related

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to the link between
our emotional body,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
our energetic body, our physical
body, our spiritual body.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, just the holistic
aspects of who we are.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Joy doesn't cause block.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It's anger, guilt, anxiety, and
depression that cause blocks.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone can be
traumatized in 30 seconds,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
why can't they be healed in
a day, an hour, a minute?

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We're just beginning to
take a look at who we are.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> If I can stand up
in front of a room,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and especially like talk to a
group of people and not feel

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
nervous, number one, the
message is going to come through

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.672 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
way more effective.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll be able to communicate
my message better, I mean.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But it just brings
a whole new element

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
into what I'm capable of doing.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Each of us has the
potential to be extraordinary,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to be brilliant, to do
anything we want to do.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to start from that
belief and change these beliefs

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:90%
of who we are.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We are a profoundly
powerful people.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.707 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>> People drive by and
shout, hang in there,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
sweetheart I got L4, you know,
they'd shout out their spinal

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:90%
injuries.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:90%
It really hurts.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It feels heavy.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've got a
50-pound backpack on,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
or that my hardware's
coming out.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Like I almost want
to say to people,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:90%
is that hanging out back there?

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
real positive for me

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to think accident, accident,
accident all the time.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It happened and I
can't change that.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I wish it hadn't
happened, but it did.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.633 align:middle line:84%
I would rather focus on how
I'm able to get stronger.

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I suffered from a health
challenge for quite some time.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a 500-pound anvil
in my head weighing it down.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.035 align:middle line:84%
It feels like my whole
head's going to explode.

00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It feels like there's a
fire inside of my head.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not able just through
diet and a little bit

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
of exercise to make
any difference.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Every day I'm
dealing with the past.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So how am I supposed
to look at the future?

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I love my life.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I love where I live.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:90%
I love everything that I do.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But if I quit smoking,
within three or four days,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't like anything I do.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like my buddy.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It's like my pal.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
it's like a friend
that's killing me.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we've been so
programmed to devalue ourselves

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and disempower ourselves that
we look at ourselves as victims

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.445 align:middle line:84%
and frail biological entities,
ripe for bacteria to eat us up

00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:90%
and all these other things.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this
is totally untrue.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> When there's
pain in the body,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that's a signal that something
is not in harmony with the laws

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
with God's laws.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I see the law as
God's modus operandi.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And when there's
discomfort in the body,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:90%
we're violating the law.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.832 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us we're
doing something wrong.

00:06:48.832 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't care whether it's
thought or a movement

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:90%
or what it is.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.987 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
shift the energy.

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And as we shift the energy,
the pain will leave.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Every person I meet,
it's like waiting to unwrap

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:84%
a package-- wow,
who's in there--

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.528 align:middle line:84%
and watch them come
alive, as they realign

00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:90%
with who they really are.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And you watch their eyes
light up and they get excited.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.685 align:middle line:84%
>> All I know is that there is
a technique that's going to help

00:07:07.685 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:90%
me get better.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at it on
the net and it's something

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:90%
about tapping, tapping.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:90%
I saw people doing this.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what else--

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at people
doing this and this.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- and this--
and I was, was it that?

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.445 align:middle line:84%
>> If everything
else fails, try this.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.245 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:90%
My back is a big problem for me.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's exciting
that I'm going to have this

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
opportunity.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really unique.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> When everything
is said and done,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to look back and be able
to know that I tried absolutely

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
everything and did
everything I could.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know what to expect.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited about going.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> What I often say
is, OK, you know what?

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.862 align:middle line:84%
I have this little
technique that I think

00:07:56.862 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:90%
might really be helpful here.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, it might seem
a little strange,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
but if you're willing to
play along and work with me,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
let's just give it a try
and see what happens.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a tool that allows
you to release what's blocking

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:90%
the powers of healing.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's an
emotional trauma,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.018 align:middle line:84%
something happens
something I watch on CNN,

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
something that happens
to a friend of mine,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
something that happens to
me, there is an energetic

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:90%
disruption that occurs.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we bring
some soothing to that.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You bring a problem to
mind, a trauma, for example,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and you tap on your
body like this.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And we do that while tapping
into a particular emotional

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:90%
state, a feeling in the body.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.784 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
we're soothing it.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first learned that
he was talking about tapping

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
on different points on your
body, I think I was skeptical.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:90%
But I was also desperate.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> If I can start to open up and
release some of these feelings

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
that I've had in the past and
clear away some experiences

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:90%
that are no longer relevant.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:84%

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And the nervous system,
of course, is electrical.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So tapping just initiates
an electrical current.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:28.893 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.893 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's go through the
points real quickly so that you

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
know what points
we're talking about.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
We start with a
karate chop point.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's along the
side of the hand.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And use your fingertips and just
tap on the side of your hand

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We will start here and do a
lot of tapping here, while we

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:90%
make certain statements.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about that in a minute.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
During the dark
moments of your day,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
what might you say about
your immune system?

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It's failing me.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's failing me.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So what we would say is, even
though my immune system is

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
failing me right now, I deeply
and completely accept myself.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
Even-- and we state
that three times.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would then start
tapping on these other points.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And we use what's called
a reminder phrase.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and all
the ways that it fails me--

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm just coming up
with something, right?

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and all
the ways that it fails me.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and all
the ways that it fails me.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and all
the ways that it fails me.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're
tapping, if you were

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.733 align:middle line:84%
to imagine drumming on a
table and making a noise,

00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that's about how
much pressure you

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:84%
want to use so
that you're really

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.402 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the bone
underneath the tissue.

00:17:46.402 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have to--

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
some people really
tap hard, thinking

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that's going to do
a big difference.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make that
much difference.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, really
intense tapping, right?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:90%
That's not necessary.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Some people tap in a circle.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Some people pat
their head, right?

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You just gently tap
the top of the head.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's just about
the center of your head.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So the eyebrow point is at
the beginning of your eyebrow.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's on both sides.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you can tap
both hands, one hand.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:90%
You can crossover.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.438 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I feel like I want
a little more stimulation,

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.772 align:middle line:90%
and I'll use both hands.

00:18:27.772 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So the next point is
along the side of the eye.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not so close it makes
you blink and not so far back

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.018 align:middle line:84%
that you feel like
you're on your temple.

00:18:34.018 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:84%
It's really on the
bone right here, OK?

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Everybody got that?

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Under the eye point,
it's a little sensitive,

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:84%
so you don't want to
bang on it real hard,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's right directly
below the pupil

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and just tap gently there.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Under the nose.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, I curl my lip down a little
bit when I tap under the nose

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
because I want to be able
to make it a little firmer.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.282 align:middle line:90%
You all right?

00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:01.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Tickles.

00:19:01.082 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It tickles.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so try a little
firmer, a little firmer.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.165 align:middle line:90%
Chin.

00:19:09.165 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually
doing the chin.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:90%
They call it the chin point.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:90%
It's in the crease here, OK?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:90%
And just tap there.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the collar bone
point, the collar bone

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:84%
itself, you have it
on both sides, right?

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's where the whole shoulder
attaches to your body.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So find that bone on
both sides and then come

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
down about an inch into the
soft tissue right there.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
These are the under
the arm points.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the under arm points
is not way up in the armpit.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It's about mid-bra line for
women, about a hand width.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
If you start feeling very
emotional about anything that

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:90%
comes up, just start tapping.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to notice every once

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
in a while you can stop
and take a look at where

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
your intensity is on that,
and notice that it will shift.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>> If on a scale of 0 to 10,
0 being no feeling whatsoever

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and 10 being the highest
level of distress,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
where would you put
your level of distress?

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a way of
telling whether or not

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:90%
a change has occurred.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.140 align:middle line:84%
We bring the issue to
mind, we give it a number.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.302 align:middle line:84%
You go ahead and do the
tapping, and then you

00:20:21.302 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:90%
check the number again.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
That guides you to
know is it working

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:84%
or is there
something in the way?

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we want to
do is scale the intensity

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:84%
or the charge you
have on this issue.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's say someone hurt
you very badly and you're mad

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:90%
at an ex-spouse.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:84%
When you think of
him or her, how much?

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.038 align:middle line:90%
0 to 10, 10 is the highest.

00:20:42.038 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you want
that is because you

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
want to measure after doing
the tapping if it's gone down.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.412 align:middle line:84%
You want to have
a pre-measurement

00:20:49.412 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and a post-measurement.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.453 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's very hard.

00:20:51.453 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, that
doesn't bother me anymore,

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.462 align:middle line:84%
and they're not really
paying attention

00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:90%
to how much better they feel.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And we may ask you
things like, well,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.148 align:middle line:84%
what does that
feeling remind you of?

00:21:01.148 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are obvious.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
If you were in a car
accident, clearly

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
that's something that
was a big trauma.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But some of the things you'll
be like, oh, this can't be it.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Those are magical words for us.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make any sense--

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:90%
magical words for us.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:90%
This couldn't be it.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a doorway into
the body's energy system,

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:90%
into the feeling of it.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people get
stuck just getting started.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So what I suggest that they do
is pick a pain in your body,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.745 align:middle line:84%
pick someplace that
you have tension.

00:21:33.745 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll be working primarily
with Jodi, but each of you,

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
by tapping and
stimulating your system,

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that the things
that come up for her may not

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:90%
always be applicable to you.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.173 align:middle line:84%
But you'll be surprised at how
much of the human experience

00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:90%
we all have in common.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> With fibromyalgia, your
muscles are always tense.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:90%
You never really fully relax.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:90%
So that would be nice.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's an autoimmune illness
because it's literally

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:90%
you're attacking yourself.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I do.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
It can get really bad.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But the most difficulties I
have are generally in my wrists,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's probably because I
type a lot, and in my knees.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:90%
And I used to walk.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I used to walk a
whole lot every day.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I would go for about an
hour walk, and I loved it.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:90%
But I just can't do it anymore.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's frustrating
to me because I really

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
like to be outside
and I love to walk.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.727 align:middle line:90%
So I don't like that.

00:22:30.727 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I want to get back to where
I can go outside again

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and walk around.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> For each of you, find
some part of your body

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:84%
that's feeling some
physical discomfort.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Write it down, if you would.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And then just ask
yourself, if there

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
was an emotion in this part
of my body, what might it be?

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an emotional
connection in about 85% of all

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:90%
physical illnesses.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
pre-- people know that.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:84%
What they don't fully understand
is that the solution for that

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:90%
isn't necessarily a drug.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.588 align:middle line:90%

>> If you were to get
really angry at your knee--

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
do you ever get
angry at your knees?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.015 align:middle line:90%
So what do you say to them?

00:23:16.015 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> What do I say?

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I say, how dare
you betray me.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Great job.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
See how we're using just
whatever words are coming up?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Even though my knees
have betrayed me--

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though my knees
have betrayed me--

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept myself.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept myself.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes people have a
conflict with saying they

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:90%
accept their behavior.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
They say, I don't want
to say I accept myself.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Accepting yourself does
not make you get stuck.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I find this one statement
alone to be one of the most

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.032 align:middle line:84%
powerful in cleansing
and clearing.

00:23:48.032 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it
has to do with just

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
being willing to love
yourself no matter

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in this moment.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember working
with a colleague of mine,

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:90%
a mother of three small girls.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:84%
We were traveling
together, and we

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:90%
were having dinner one night.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And she was sharing with me
that she smoked cigarettes

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and that she was
really embarrassed

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:90%
that she smoked cigarettes.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And she also really
felt horrible

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:84%
being a mother of three small
girls and smoking cigarettes.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I told her
that if she wanted

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I would teach her the
technique to help her possibly

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:90%
quit smoking.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.282 align:middle line:84%
I'd never used it
for smoking before,

00:24:22.282 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:84%
but I figured, what the heck,
I use it for everything.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.630 align:middle line:90%
And I started to treat her.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And just using the
setup phrase, I

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.320 align:middle line:84%
said to her, I you to start
with even though I smoke,

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I deeply and profoundly
accept myself.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm a
mom and I smoke,

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I deeply and profoundly
accept myself.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm
smoking and it sets

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
a bad example for my children,
I deeply and profoundly accept

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And she burst into tears.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.215 align:middle line:84%
And I could see really
clearly it was almost

00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:90%
like I could see her block.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the self-loathing
she felt about smoking, the way

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that she beat herself
up about smoking

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
was the actual thing
that locked it in place.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I'm not
going to accept my knees--

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I'm not
going to accept my knees--

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --they have betrayed me.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --they have betrayed me.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept myself--

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept myself--

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> --and all of my attitudes--

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --and all of my attitudes--

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --even though I'm perfectly
right to feel this way.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I don't
feel I can do this,

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.945 align:middle line:90%
you acknowledge that.

00:25:24.945 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What's happening
here, first of all,

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:90%
I focused on the problem.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think just knowing
what the problem is,

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
admitting it, getting the
secret out, getting it out

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of myself is a very
therapeutic thing to do.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it was Freud--

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to paraphrase him--

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
who said the way to healing
is to have no secrets.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though he was gross--

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though he was gross--

00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>> --and I'm really angry--

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --and I'm really angry--

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> --how could he do this to me?

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>> --how could he do this to me?

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though--

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --mom didn't want me--

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> --mom didn't want me--

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> --she didn't seem
to want any of us--

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --she didn't seem
to want any of us--

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.687 align:middle line:84%
>> --and she would
even verbalize this--

00:25:57.687 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>> --she would even
verbalize this.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though--

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though--

00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --I invited myself--

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> --I invited myself--

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So you state it in present
tense and then in as much

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
specific detail as possible
with as much emotion and passion

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and enthusiasm and
vivid mental imagery,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
with as many other
sensory inputs as you can,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:90%
sounds and sights and smells.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Acknowledging your own
emotional experience is

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Being able to say I am feeling
this way, this is the emotion.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and
completely accept myself.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And we state that three times.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though my immune
system is failing me right now,

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I deeply and completely
accept myself.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the statement, "that
even though I have this fill

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:84%
in the blank problem,
I deeply love, accept,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and forgive myself,"
while tapping right here,

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
is the single most
powerful thing you can do,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, when
it comes to tapping.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and
completely accept myself.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I deeply and completely--

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I deeply in completely--

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>> --love and accept myself.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> --love and accept myself.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept myself.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept myself.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have to believe--

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.407 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have to believe--

00:27:06.407 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --because now I'm in control.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The reality is it's the
inability to accept yourself

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
with whatever faults you
perceive that you have

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that's preventing you
from moving forward.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.103 align:middle line:84%
And I usually tell people,
you'll figure that out

00:27:17.103 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:90%
in just a few minutes.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll feel
it in your body.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel it in the
body's energy system

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.522 align:middle line:90%
as you begin to embrace it.

00:27:24.522 --> 00:27:25.355 align:middle line:90%
>> I want new knees.

00:27:25.355 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I want new knees.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I must have new knees.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I must have new knees.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.990 align:middle line:90%

>> The shame.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> The shame.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> This shame in my body.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:90%

up?

they begin as a little whisper
saying, hey, pay attention

00:28:28.855 --> 00:28:29.655 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:30.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm here for healing.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they're
saying, hey, pay attention.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Your body needs
some work right now.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
If we keep on ignoring
those small symptoms

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and small issues, eventually our
body is screaming and saying,

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:84%
(LOUDLY) hey, pay attention
to me right now, or else.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Who do you think might
be represented by that pain

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:90%
in your back?

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.500 align:middle line:84%
What conflict do you think
is being stored in your knee?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is going on that

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
would make your shoulder act
up that way every time you

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:90%
have the pain?

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe, maybe the problem is
the work, that it goes into it.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Because it's work.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's mental.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's chilling out.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
It's focusing on
what the issues are.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:90%
It's analyzing your body.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I've trained myself
for the last years

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
not to think about
how I'm feeling.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's all we're doing
here is how you're feeling--

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:90%
where, how, why.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, shut up,
I just want to go to bed--

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:84%
--I don't want to
think about it.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many thoughts that
cause tremendous emotion in us.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But emotion is feeling
and it is physiological.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it has
great effects on our health

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:90%
and our physical state.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We're getting
stuck, as people,

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:84%
in patterns of thought and
emotion that keep us from

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.527 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that we've got
some work to do that we could

00:29:43.527 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
do on the accident and the
feelings around the accident.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And I can release the grief--

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I can release the grief--

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> --from my body--

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --from my body--

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> --and my mind.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> And my mind.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I can release the grief.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> To bring something into your
energy system and the energy

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:84%
field, to tap on it, you simply
imagine it as vividly as you

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:90%
can.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
You want to create an
image of it in your mind.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You want to imagine
feeling it, being there.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.207 align:middle line:90%
It's not very complicated.

00:30:15.207 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:84%
If it's something
that's worrying you,

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
you usually can imagine
it pretty quickly.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> A monster.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:90%
I was a monster.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
back from Vietnam,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I was waiting for
that monster to erupt.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.408 align:middle line:84%
And I was afraid that
I couldn't control him.

00:30:33.408 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew what I could do.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I knew what I was
capable of doing,

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.115 align:middle line:90%
and that was killing people.

00:30:42.115 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> For many people, this
may be the first time that

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.640 align:middle line:84%
you're honest about
what you're feeling.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But once you do, you'll
feel it in your body.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, their son, their
father, their brother, or--

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though--

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though--

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>> --there's no more
life in those bodies--

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.062 align:middle line:84%
>> --there's no more
life in those bodies--

00:30:58.062 --> 00:31:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though my mother's
anger is in my back,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I deeply and completely
accept myself anyway.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Even though what
happened two years ago

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
is still showing up in my
knee, and it's a wonderful way

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:90%
to clear that emotionally.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> He did scare me.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>> He did scare me.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:11.383 align:middle line:90%
>> He scared me--

00:31:11.383 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> --whether he
wanted to or not--

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> --whether he
wanted to or not--

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --he scared me.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> --he scared me.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> He scared me--

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> He scared me--

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> --that I might not walk.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.585 align:middle line:90%
>> --that I might not walk.

00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:19.615 align:middle line:90%
>> I've worked so hard--

00:31:19.615 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I've worked very hard--

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.528 align:middle line:90%
>> --to get what I have--

00:31:21.528 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --to get what I have--

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> --and he took it away.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Your emotional system is
meant to be a guidance system

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
to guide you in your life path,
that when you're on the path,

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:90%
things-- you feel good.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're veering off, that's
a feedback system to saying,

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.650 align:middle line:90%
hmm, not such a good choice.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever we have an
emotion, positive or negative,

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:84%
it sends signals
chemically to our body.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So it releases this series
of reactions in our vascular

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:84%
system, in our
respiratory system,

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.550 align:middle line:90%
in our endocrine system.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.733 align:middle line:90%
So they're always affecting us.

00:31:54.733 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're stressing
yourself with those thoughts,

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.140 align:middle line:84%
then your body has no way of
telling if there's an actual

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:84%
threat from out there,
an objective threat,

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
or whether this
image of a threat--

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:84%
your boss or your wife or
your child or whatever memory

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:90%
you have--

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.210 align:middle line:84%
this thing that
you're generating

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.590 align:middle line:90%
within your own head.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are stressed,
it puts out adrenaline,

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.350 align:middle line:84%
puts up cortisol,
puts out blood sugar,

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:90%
raises the need for insulin.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:28.843 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole body is
physiologically stressed.

00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> If something flares up,
if you suddenly get, ooh,

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that hip pain or that head pain,
we want that because that means

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.383 align:middle line:84%
that emotional issue
is contributing to it.

00:32:36.383 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So like, John, if you
go home and suddenly you

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:84%
get the knee or the back,
you think, oh, whoa,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:90%
what's happened?

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are you
thinking about?

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the
topic of that hour?

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.470 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Who just called?

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.850 align:middle line:90%
So there's great information.

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.725 align:middle line:84%
If suddenly, Dennis,
you're having a craving,

00:32:48.725 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and you think, that's unusual,
well, what just happened?

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.773 align:middle line:90%
Who'd you just run into?

00:32:52.773 --> 00:32:54.315 align:middle line:84%
>> So many times I
was just like, oh,

00:32:54.315 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I wish someone would just come
and take some of this weight,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, to take some of this
burden off me and felt despair

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like there
really wasn't anyone to come

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:90%
and relieve some of it.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you address the
underlying emotional

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.830 align:middle line:84%
contributions, then
physical changes occur.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.782 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a soul
mate that I lost.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm learning
to work with that.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's still, like I said,
a long process there.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The unconscious, it's there
to protect us from any kind

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:84%
of pain, and it gets in the way
because we can't seem to peel

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.350 align:middle line:84%
all the layers off that
we want to peel off.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
we kind of get stuck.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I think grief is maybe
the hardest thing to put

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:90%
into perspective for people.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We've done it with
accidents and trauma

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of other issues.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.290 align:middle line:84%
However, I think grief is
a bit more complicated.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I've worked with people who
had grief for family members

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.540 align:middle line:84%
or close people that
they'd lost in accidents.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that's
coupled with shock.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:84%
That's coupled with
the pain of thinking

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.860 align:middle line:90%
of the person being hurt.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:90%

birthday, if you can see that,

right?

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:90%
She put 36.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:36.849 align:middle line:90%
She lied to me about her age.

00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:90%
And this was back in '04.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.989 align:middle line:84%
This was in the

This is the last Christmas, '06.

Over here we have more pictures
of us at Great Adventures.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.990 align:middle line:84%
are lost because of
things like that?

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:57.563 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.563 --> 00:41:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I wonder, why do
I always have to be perfect?

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do that to myself?

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a punishment, obviously.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you punishing yourself
or protecting yourself?

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Perfectionism is usually
about protection,

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.220 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't have to be.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I went right back to being a
kid again when you went through

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:90%
that whole process.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And then this has got to be
going back to when I'm a child.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> This has to be when that
starts, is when I was so young.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us the incident.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:26.215 align:middle line:84%
OK, so she says
it hasn't changed.

00:42:26.215 --> 00:42:27.840 align:middle line:84%
What's going on is
that she went back--

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> (WHISPERING) I
don't want to tell.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.152 align:middle line:90%
>> --to a specific--

00:42:29.152 --> 00:42:31.110 align:middle line:84%
only what you want and
feel comfortable talking

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.228 align:middle line:84%
about-- but an incident where
you learned [GASPS] I've

00:42:34.228 --> 00:42:36.270 align:middle line:84%
got to be perfect or else
look what could happen.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.780 align:middle line:84%
There's some important
incidents that's driving this.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.283 align:middle line:84%
And there could be 50
incidents, but there's one

00:42:43.283 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that you could think of and
bring up and talk about.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.033 align:middle line:84%
Only what you feel
comfortable talking

00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:49.230 align:middle line:90%
about that were drivers.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It has to do with trying
to be seen by my father

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and remembering he'd go
away for weeks at a time--

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:90%
because he was a salesman.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
came home, we'd all

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:84%
get excited and run out there
because we wanted to see him.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And he would just ignore me,
but he would go get my sister

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:90%
and pick her up.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And I would sit there
going, why not me?

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.060 align:middle line:90%
How intense.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>> That's intense.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.150 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Hurt?

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Sadness?

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Hurt.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Hurt, OK.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Kids are really, really,
really, really open.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.305 align:middle line:84%
When they're really young,
they don't know anything

00:43:21.305 --> 00:43:22.380 align:middle line:90%
but what you teach them.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Our first six years,
we're not actually engaging

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.550 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.340 align:middle line:84%
We're just downloading
experiences.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, these experiences
then, we play them back

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:35.060 align:middle line:84%
as our life characters
and our life behaviors.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you downloaded
them from other people.

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So that you download
your parents' behaviors,

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.603 align:middle line:90%
and they become your behaviors.

00:43:42.603 --> 00:43:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie, what's going on, just
as we're doing all that tapping

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:46.070 align:middle line:90%
about family stuff?

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of family stuff
coming up, and it kind of

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.420 align:middle line:84%
goes to I have to be perfect
or they'll get mad at me

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
because, I mean, it's
probably so many times.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember, but one
particular time-- because there

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:90%
was six girls and three boys.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I was the second youngest.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.806 align:middle line:84%
And my dad used to always
beat the older boys.

00:44:07.806 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.588 align:middle line:84%
Tap on your collar
bone right now.

00:44:11.588 --> 00:44:12.995 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:12.995 --> 00:44:15.340 align:middle line:90%
[SOBBING]

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Which I obviously
must have witnessed.

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, mm-hmm.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And how do you feel when
you're telling us that?

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Just say one more sentence
about it or a little bit more

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.256 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:44:26.256 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Or just go to the eyebrow.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.723 align:middle line:90%
He beat my brothers.

00:44:29.723 --> 00:44:30.681 align:middle line:90%
>> He beat my brothers.

00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> The side of the eye.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't stop him.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.396 align:middle line:90%
He beat my brothers.

00:44:37.396 --> 00:44:38.354 align:middle line:90%
>> He beat my brothers.

00:44:38.354 --> 00:44:39.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Under the nose.

00:44:39.154 --> 00:44:40.785 align:middle line:90%
And obviously, I witnessed it.

00:44:40.785 --> 00:44:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And obviously I witnessed it.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.296 align:middle line:90%
>> He beat my brothers.

00:44:44.296 --> 00:44:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> He beat my brothers.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.838 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I don't
want anyone mad at me.

00:44:47.838 --> 00:44:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I don't
want anyone mad at me.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.716 align:middle line:84%
>> I certainly don't
want my father mad at me.

00:44:51.716 --> 00:44:53.568 align:middle line:84%
>> I certainly don't
want him mad at me.

00:44:53.568 --> 00:44:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> If something comes up that
you don't want to say out loud,

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.780 align:middle line:84%
or you don't want to own, or
you don't want to say you accept

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.990 align:middle line:84%
about yourself, that's the very
thing you want to tap about.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Because that's-- the good news
is that's leading you right

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.137 align:middle line:90%
to why you're stuck.

00:45:06.137 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:84%
It's shining a light
on the place that

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.580 align:middle line:84%
needs your love
and your compassion

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.645 align:middle line:84%
and your self-acceptance
more than anything else.

00:45:11.645 --> 00:45:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And the quicker you can get
there and give yourself that,

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.060 align:middle line:84%
the quicker you're going
to dissolve that block

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.230 align:middle line:90%
and get on with your life.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The subconscious has programs
in it that we primarily got

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:84%
from other people
in our development.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
about that is

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that if we are operating
from the subconscious mind

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.220 align:middle line:84%
or not seeing it,
then we're also

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:84%
not seeing that we're
playing programs

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that may not be in any
way supporting who we are

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.290 align:middle line:90%
and what we want.

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of us have core
issues around powerlessness

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:90%
and worthlessness.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.300 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Two things.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm powerless and I'm worthless.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.030 align:middle line:84%
We pick that up at some
level, to some degree,

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.440 align:middle line:90%
in our childhood.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I
try to be perfect.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I
try to be perfect.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Eyebrow.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:52.130 align:middle line:90%
He beat my brothers--

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> He beat my brothers--

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:54.243 align:middle line:90%
>> --and I watched--

00:45:55.077 --> 00:45:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> --and I heard--

>> --and I heard--

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --and I felt it.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> --and I felt it.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.832 align:middle line:90%
>> He beat my brothers.

00:45:59.832 --> 00:46:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> He beat my brothers.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I've been
trying to be perfect.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I've been
trying to be perfect.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.703 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if you're
perfect, you won't be beaten.

00:46:05.703 --> 00:46:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if you're
perfect, you won't be beaten.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In the midst of all this,
I went to the bathroom.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.240 align:middle line:84%
For my whole life,
since I've been

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:18.050 align:middle line:84%
taught, since I've
been potty trained,

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was normal
to hold it forever.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.800 align:middle line:84%
In grade school, I had to raise
my hand to go to the bathroom.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:90%
And if the teacher didn't--

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.610 align:middle line:84%
if the teacher was
involved with something

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that was important to her or
him, whoever the teacher was,

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.220 align:middle line:90%
they would just ignore my hand.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.638 align:middle line:84%
And I remember wetting myself in
like the third or fourth grade

00:46:42.638 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because I just couldn't
hold it any longer,

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.820 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't get
permission to go.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And that has stayed
with me since then.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll often say
to people, well--

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:58.430 align:middle line:84%
as we're tapping
through a round--

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:01.300 align:middle line:84%
you're living your life
based on the decision

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.160 align:middle line:90%
of a kindergartner.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.440 align:middle line:84%
How often do you now go
down to the local school

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and go to the kindergarten class
and ask kids for their advice

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.440 align:middle line:90%
on your major life decisions?

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what's your name?

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Stevie.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, look, I'm thinking of
buying a couple of houses.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Here are the different
house I'm looking at.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.370 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:22.870 align:middle line:84%
They say, well,
that would be crazy.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
you're doing it though.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You're asking a kindergartner
for advice in everything

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:27.890 align:middle line:90%
you do.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:29.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, should I ask
my boss for a raise?

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.348 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, don't do that.

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.390 align:middle line:90%
The teacher will get mad.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We learn our behaviors
and learn about interpersonal

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.880 align:middle line:84%
interaction from our parents
and how their relationship is,

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.700 align:middle line:84%
how they treat our siblings,
whether we have siblings.

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.410 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
learn everything,

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:46.790 align:middle line:84%
is really what do people
say to each other?

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.910 align:middle line:84%
How do they respond
after an argument?

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.770 align:middle line:84%
What do they do when
there's tension?

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.065 align:middle line:90%
And kids pick all that up.

00:47:52.065 --> 00:47:53.940 align:middle line:84%
They know when there's
tension in their room.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.497 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what
a razor strap is?

00:47:55.497 --> 00:47:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a piece of leather that
the old barber used to sharpen

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:04.060 align:middle line:84%
their straight edge razors
and [MIMICS RAZOR SCRAPING]..

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So when I wouldn't do something
my father wanted me to do,

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:09.240 align:middle line:84%
he'd get the razor strap
out and just whip me.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And it seemed like every day.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it was every
day, but it was several times

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.560 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Why am I carrying this?

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Why am I carrying this?

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Why am I carrying
this sadness?

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Why am I carrying
this sadness?

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Why can't I bring
it down to a zero?

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Why can't I bring it
down-- ooh-- down to a zero?

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened?

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Wait, why did you say that?

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I just understood
where I'm feeling so sad.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if this
hadn't happened,

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:39.866 align:middle line:84%
maybe my relationship with my
father could be much better.

00:48:39.866 --> 00:48:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned into that.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.160 align:middle line:90%
This relationship.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What's really important is
to be willing to work to get

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.550 align:middle line:84%
to the root cause
of what's going on.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that generally comes up as
a thought, a memory, an idea,

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.468 align:middle line:84%
an image, or something
that's generated from within.

00:48:59.468 --> 00:49:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Get together with a group
of friends and brainstorm.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.427 align:middle line:84%
What are the things your parents
said to you growing up that you

00:49:04.427 --> 00:49:06.195 align:middle line:90%
think are still limiting you?

00:49:06.195 --> 00:49:08.320 align:middle line:84%
If you get five or six
people together and do that,

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and people start
saying things like,

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.890 align:middle line:84%
well, eat all the food on
your plate, the kids in China

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:14.560 align:middle line:84%
are starving, and then
you go, and today,

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.630 align:middle line:84%
if I go to a salad bar,
and I take a lot of food,

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:17.920 align:middle line:84%
even if I'm full,
I keep eating it

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.128 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want the
children in China to starve,

00:49:20.128 --> 00:49:21.520 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.343 align:middle line:84%
So that brainstorming
technique, you

00:49:23.343 --> 00:49:24.760 align:middle line:84%
can come out with
a lot of things.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, children should
be seen and not heard.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.200 align:middle line:90%
You'll never amount to anything.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Your father was a drunk,
so you'll be a drunk, too.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.530 align:middle line:84%
No women in this family
have ever gone to college,

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and what makes
you think you can?

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
hide your feelings

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.883 align:middle line:84%
and don't air your
dirty laundry in public.

00:49:40.883 --> 00:49:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a
ton of stuff we got.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:46.327 align:middle line:84%
>> To give you an amusing
anecdote about it is,

00:49:46.327 --> 00:49:48.160 align:middle line:84%
you know somebody and
you know their parent,

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.702 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that this person
and their parent pretty much

00:49:50.702 --> 00:49:52.180 align:middle line:90%
have the same behavior.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you, in enthusiasm,
you burst on the scene,

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.060 align:middle line:84%
you say, you know, Mary,
you're just like your mom.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.780 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you say that to
Mary, back away from Mary.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Because she's not going to take
this as welcoming news for her.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:84%
She's going to say like,
how can you say that?

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:10.390 align:middle line:84%
To her, she's not
like her mom at all.

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.700 align:middle line:90%
And the issue is interesting.

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like the joke is, everybody
else can see that Mary's like

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.530 align:middle line:90%
her mom, but Mary can't.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
because when she's

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.930 align:middle line:84%
playing the programs, which
she got from her mother, which

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.850 align:middle line:84%
are in her subconscious,
she's playing them

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:26.380 align:middle line:84%
because she's not
paying attention.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And so when they play,
she doesn't see them.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So she's surprised
when people say

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that she behaves like her
mom, even though that's

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.960 align:middle line:90%
what her life is all about.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're feeling
bad, look at what thoughts

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:37.540 align:middle line:90%
you're thinking.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.327 align:middle line:84%
And then if they're
limiting beliefs

00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that have been habitual--
because a belief is just

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.202 align:middle line:84%
a thought you think
over and over and over.

00:50:43.202 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I feel that
he power trips over me.

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like he's always
blaming me for something

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and making me feel inadequate.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.755 align:middle line:90%
>> I just can't possibly do it.

00:50:52.755 --> 00:50:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Other people can
plan their week.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.450 align:middle line:84%
I just can't seem
to plan my week.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:58.015 align:middle line:84%
Things always come
up, and I just

00:50:58.015 --> 00:50:59.140 align:middle line:90%
can't even get it on paper.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:02.892 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't feel like I
should have a happy family.

00:51:02.892 --> 00:51:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's about my
family because I--

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Got that?

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --destroyed all
these other families.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What I found is when you
state the limiting belief,

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:11.780 align:middle line:90%
like I'm not good enough.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.323 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid.

00:51:13.323 --> 00:51:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where money's
going to come from.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if my business
is going to succeed.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.698 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
all kind of beliefs

00:51:18.698 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:90%
that are unique to the person.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.430 align:middle line:84%
When you state that, you're
not anchoring the belief.

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.860 align:middle line:90%
You are releasing the belief.

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When I said self-blame,
or I blame myself,

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.275 align:middle line:90%
did that resonate with you?

00:51:30.275 --> 00:51:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I blame myself
for everything.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.736 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:51:32.736 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Say out loud, it's my fault.

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my fault.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all my fault.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all my fault.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> They wouldn't help me.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>> They blamed me
for the accident--

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm angry about it.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.445 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm very angry about it.

00:51:43.445 --> 00:51:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not fair.

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Under the nose.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Haven't I suffered enough?

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Haven't I suffered enough?

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> 99% of the time when people
name the issue accurately

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and are allowed to finally
say, I'm resentful,

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.107 align:middle line:84%
or I'm so profoundly
hurt, or the betrayal,

00:51:58.107 --> 00:51:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought the betrayal
was going to kill me,

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.550 align:middle line:84%
when they say it out
loud, they might cry,

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:04.830 align:middle line:84%
but they are
completely relieved.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Say out loud, I
chose a lousy partner.

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I chose a lousy partner.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> How true is that?

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.762 align:middle line:84%
>> It's-- he's still
a lousy person.

00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:14.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.802 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm afraid to get better--

00:52:15.802 --> 00:52:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm afraid to get better--

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --because it's going
to threaten my brother.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>> --because it's going
to threaten my brother.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.737 align:middle line:90%
>> How does that feel?

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I feel that--

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:28.670 align:middle line:90%
very probable.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:29.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Very probable.

00:52:29.692 --> 00:52:30.632 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:30.632 --> 00:52:32.090 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
possibility you could

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.290 align:middle line:84%
be holding onto the symptoms
so that he doesn't get upset?

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Or threatened.

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:36.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:36.782 --> 00:52:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:39.865 align:middle line:84%
>> The challenge with helping
somebody to get past a belief

00:52:39.865 --> 00:52:41.990 align:middle line:84%
like that is showing them,
first of all, that look,

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.890 align:middle line:90%
it is just a belief.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Would you entertain the
idea of changing it?

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We're always going
to have problems.

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the nature of
the human experience.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.320 align:middle line:84%
What you do about them,
however, is up to you.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>> What are the obstacles?

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:56.660 align:middle line:90%
What are the traumas?

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.170 align:middle line:84%
What are the moments
in time where

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:04.037 align:middle line:84%
you formed a belief about
something that keeps you stuck?

00:53:04.037 --> 00:53:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And really working
through those and working

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.380 align:middle line:84%
through the different
levels as well.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Even I feel guilty--

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.360 align:middle line:84%

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There is something
else going on.

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's an invisible
part of all of this.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:30.603 align:middle line:90%
It's such an experiential thing.

00:53:30.603 --> 00:53:33.440 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about it all day,
but until a person experiences

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.103 align:middle line:84%
what it feels like, that
resistance to melt away,

00:53:36.103 --> 00:53:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
just theoretical.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to walk
them through it.

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember doing a seminar
for a Benedictine abbey down

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:43.670 align:middle line:90%
in Florida.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And many of the monks there
were there out of guilt,

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.340 align:middle line:84%
not out of a desire
to be closer to God.

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.680 align:middle line:84%
One guy had taken an entire
troop up the Rhine River

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.970 align:middle line:90%
during World War II.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.567 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was killed but
him, and he was the leader.

00:53:55.567 --> 00:53:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So he came back, went on
about a three-week drunk,

00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:59.317 align:middle line:84%
and then basically
joined the monastery.

00:53:59.317 --> 00:54:00.655 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so why did you join?

00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:02.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, because
I didn't believe

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I deserved to have any
more pleasure in my life.

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:06.230 align:middle line:90%
I did kind of abrogate that.

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And so this sense
of unworthiness

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:90%
is a big issue for people.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Say out loud.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm just
testing him, right?

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.967 align:middle line:84%
I don't deserve to
have a happy family.

00:54:13.967 --> 00:54:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't deserve to
have a happy marriage.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> How true does
that feel, 0 to 10?

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's way down.

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Way down.

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Could you give it a number?

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> 2.

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:23.270 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:24.100 align:middle line:90%
From a 10 to a 2.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.600 align:middle line:84%
If your vibration is, I don't
deserve to have a happy family

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's as high as a 10,
when it goes down to a 2,

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.470 align:middle line:90%
your vibration is different.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Your behavior is different.

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:32.900 align:middle line:90%
How you talk to people.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.910 align:middle line:90%
How you stand, your posture.

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything will be different
if your vibration changes

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.310 align:middle line:90%
that much.

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.602 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a beautiful word
dealing with beliefs called

00:54:40.602 --> 00:54:41.540 align:middle line:90%
"praxis."

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:84%
P-R-A-X-I-S. It's
an excellent word.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.997 align:middle line:84%
Praxis is the integration
of belief with behavior.

00:54:49.997 --> 00:54:51.455 align:middle line:84%
You'll often hear
people say, yeah,

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I can do a
lot better than I'm doing.

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.840 align:middle line:90%
But they don't do it.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:00.950 align:middle line:84%
They believe it intellectually,
but their paradigm

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:02.310 align:middle line:90%
doesn't believe it.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:05.420 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, I believe
I could multiply my income.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.910 align:middle line:84%
But their paradigm is
saying, you just never

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.830 align:middle line:90%
have enough money.

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So you see, we have beliefs
on a conscious level,

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're beliefs we normally
discuss in a social situation,

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.760 align:middle line:90%
in conversation.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch
the person that's

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.708 align:middle line:84%
saying that they
believe this, they

00:55:20.708 --> 00:55:22.362 align:middle line:84%
believe that, watch
their behavior.

00:55:22.362 --> 00:55:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Their behavior and their
results would indicate

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.403 align:middle line:90%
they've never heard of it.

00:55:25.403 --> 00:55:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Positive thinking is a
creative thought that comes

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:29.660 align:middle line:90%
from the conscious mind.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:35.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if I have a thought
for being healthy or being

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.760 align:middle line:84%
in a good relationship, and
I'm doing positive thinking,

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time I
have acquired programs

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:43.430 align:middle line:84%
in my development that
said, you are not as healthy

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:middle line:84%
as you think you
are, and you're not

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.080 align:middle line:84%
that good a person to have
those kind of relationships.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Then look, I'm now pitting
my positive thoughts

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.920 align:middle line:84%
against my programs
and they're opposite.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What you fight
against stronger.

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.320 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't get weaker.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.200 align:middle line:84%
What you resist persists,
as the old saying goes.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.267 align:middle line:84%
So when you are fighting
against negatives,

00:56:05.267 --> 00:56:06.350 align:middle line:90%
you're strengthening them.

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:07.250 align:middle line:90%
You're thinking of them.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying all
this negative stuff,

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:11.360 align:middle line:84%
but tacking on the points,
then the only thing I can think

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.860 align:middle line:84%
of is you're releasing that
problem by addressing it.

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.452 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'd say-- and
that's come up a lot.

00:56:16.452 --> 00:56:18.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I'm
trying to be positive,

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.903 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to
speak the negative.

00:56:19.903 --> 00:56:22.195 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm sure you've heard
of the technique of writing

00:56:22.195 --> 00:56:23.570 align:middle line:90%
an enormous check to yourself.

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you write a check
out for a million dollars.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:28.890 align:middle line:84%
That's not enough for
law of attraction.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:31.680 align:middle line:84%
What I want you to do is look
at the check written out to you,

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.740 align:middle line:90%
look at the amount and hold it.

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.970 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:37.953 align:middle line:84%
And if you have any anxiety
or any emotional blocks

00:56:37.953 --> 00:56:39.620 align:middle line:84%
to holding that check
that's written out

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to you for a million
dollars, that's

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:42.710 align:middle line:90%
going to get in your way.

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I need to let go of whatever
it is, release, literally,

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.770 align:middle line:84%
what I've been holding onto
and let it go so that I have

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:51.740 align:middle line:84%
a capacity to receive that
which is wanting to come

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.050 align:middle line:84%
into my life, that which
I preferred and desired

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and tended and set goals
around and so forth.

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to work hard
to have enough money.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.635 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't want to be poor.

00:57:03.635 --> 00:57:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be without money.

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I went through the last
five years being very broke,

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.620 align:middle line:84%
having to declare
bankruptcy in 2001.

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Poor me.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Poor me.

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Poor me.

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm poor.

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, financially.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.513 align:middle line:90%
I don't have what I really want.

00:57:20.513 --> 00:57:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> If you want to know what
you believe about money,

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.230 align:middle line:90%
just look at your money status.

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:26.940 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
with your money?

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> People think they're
focused on something positive,

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're not.

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So they think they're focused
on, I want more money.

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't I getting it?

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.280 align:middle line:84%
They're actually quite
worried about scarcity

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and not being able
to pay their bills.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The way to earn
money is out there.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.050 align:middle line:90%
The information is out there.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're in an office
here surrounded by information.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.700 align:middle line:90%
There's no shortage of that.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.890 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
interrupts that flow

00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:51.870 align:middle line:90%
is you and your beliefs.

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:55.697 align:middle line:84%
And the tapping helps erase
the negative limiting beliefs.

00:57:55.697 --> 00:57:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though I went bankrupt--

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though I went bankrupt--

00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.405 align:middle line:84%
>> --and I think
it's disgusting--

00:57:59.405 --> 00:58:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> --and I think
it's disgusting--

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>> --I deeply and profoundly--

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> --I deeply and profoundly--

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:04.945 align:middle line:90%
>> --accept myself anyway.

00:58:04.945 --> 00:58:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --accept myself anyway.

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If I keep trying to
be safe all the time,

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I won't take chances.

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I won't take risks.

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't push myself to
do what I know I can do

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.820 align:middle line:90%
because it might not be safe.

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember what
she told us earlier?

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:17.397 --> 00:58:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It might not be totally safe,
so then you protect yourself.

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You live a very safe,
quiet, small life.

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we work on
keeping ourselves balanced

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.150 align:middle line:84%
energetically using
these kinds of tools,

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:29.550 align:middle line:90%
the more attractive we become.

00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:31.435 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about physical beauty

00:58:31.435 --> 00:58:33.810 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, although I'm sure
that's part of it as well.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking
about energetically,

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.920 align:middle line:84%
as we start to put the
energy body into balance,

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.183 align:middle line:84%
we naturally begin to
allow wonderful things

00:58:43.183 --> 00:58:44.100 align:middle line:90%
to come into our life.

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.750 align:middle line:84%
We start attracting wonderful
things into our life.

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That true repetition of

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And the first night I
actually fell asleep,

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
slept through the
night without waking up

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and woke up feeling better than
I have in a very long time.

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
surprising to me.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:43.210 align:middle line:90%


01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I tend
to define "miracle"

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
as something that is
really, really good that we

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.505 align:middle line:90%
can't explain.

01:05:48.505 --> 01:05:52.172 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what we see
would fall into that category.

01:05:52.172 --> 01:05:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think there
was one person here that

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:56.970 align:middle line:84%
didn't surprise me, of
the things that happened

01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:58.270 align:middle line:90%
to everybody

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I absolutely feel that
my relationship is going

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:01.730 align:middle line:90%
to change.

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's all good.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel this fear.

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:07.125 align:middle line:84%
I think I've
overcome a huge fear.

01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:10.860 align:middle line:90%


01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Anything you
encounter that looks

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
like an obstacle on the other
side of that hill or mountain

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest
opportunity of your life.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:21.068 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:21.068 --> 01:06:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The proof is in the pudding.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.902 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you calibrate that
your fear on a scale of 1 to 10

01:06:24.902 --> 01:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is 9, and then after doing
a sequence a few times,

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.307 align:middle line:84%
it's like 1, and
then you say, OK,

01:06:30.307 --> 01:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
so come on up to the
front of the room

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and turn round and
face the audience.

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And before, they would
have been shaking,

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and now they're relaxed.

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
That's all the
explanation you need.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like where
does this come from?

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just you're
tapping on somebody

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.370 align:middle line:90%
else's, and it just, whoosh.

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
These things come up and it
is so relieving, refreshing,

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.100 align:middle line:90%
to just let them go.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
there, they're buried.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
know they're there.

01:06:56.970 --> 01:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone's issues I
can kind of resonate with.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I just wish I understood how
you can tap on someone else's

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:08.070 align:middle line:90%
issues, and it can help you.

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to
get hung up about that.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:10.920 align:middle line:90%
It works.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:14.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's good for me.

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:16.710 align:middle line:90%
That's good enough for me.

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm humbled every
day I go to work.

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:22.130 align:middle line:90%
The results are humbling.

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to describe the
help that people are getting.

01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Lifelong ailments gone.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.550 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely amazing.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your physical
sensation of your back been

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:38.430 align:middle line:90%
like?

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I know when we
talked at your home,

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
you really felt the rods and the
screws in there all the time.

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a constant
heavy presence.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:49.822 align:middle line:90%
And now it's not heavy.

01:07:49.822 --> 01:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll stop at the end of
the day and I'll think,

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
oh, I haven't
thought of my back,

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
except when we're in
a session, and they're

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
asking me to speak about it and
go there and think about it.

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And it felt wonderful
immediately afterwards.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was the benefit
of getting through that,

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.680 align:middle line:90%
to have this awesome outcome.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680 align:middle line:90%
The pain's not an issue.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
The pain isn't requiring
99.5% of my time now.

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's very exciting.

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to learn that
these things are real,

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.999 align:middle line:84%
and they're powerful
and they can heal.

01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:22.444 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:08:22.444 --> 01:08:24.889 align:middle line:90%


01:08:24.889 --> 01:08:27.334 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:27.334 --> 01:08:29.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, that's what
I'm talking about!

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:32.713 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

01:08:32.713 --> 01:08:35.647 align:middle line:90%


01:08:35.647 --> 01:08:37.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:38.894 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my kind of surprise.

01:08:38.894 --> 01:08:41.819 align:middle line:84%
And when I first saw the
cakes, my first response

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
was, oh, how beautiful they are,
how they were each decorated.

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I did not have the
feeling like, oh, wow,

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:51.450 align:middle line:90%
can't wait to dive in.

01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:53.189 align:middle line:84%
It's a delight to
see them, but I

01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:55.189 align:middle line:84%
don't feel like,
oh wow, I'm going

01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:57.359 align:middle line:90%
to eat each and every one.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
the issue with me

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
if I had any emotion
at all, good or bad,

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:05.069 align:middle line:84%
I felt like, oh, I
have to eat something.

01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:07.229 align:middle line:90%
They somehow got connected.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:09.819 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like we've
broken that connection.

01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So I can feel something
and then realize

01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I want to put
something in my mouth.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Many emotions are
quieted through food.

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the food is used so
quickly to stop the emotion,

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
you hardly know you
have the emotion.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.552 align:middle line:84%
You just grab for
the food instead.

01:09:30.552 --> 01:09:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think the
extra food is doing for you?

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Because your body doesn't
need it as far as hunger goes.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So what are you
trying to do with it?

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
What do you think food is
providing for you that you're

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.399 align:middle line:90%
not getting in your life?

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll say to
people, what's missing?

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
What's missing that you would
now be 50 pounds overweight

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and using food chronically,
all day long, for 30 years?

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.069 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:54.393 align:middle line:84%
And often they'll
say, loneliness.

01:09:54.393 --> 01:09:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Often they'll say there's
an emptiness inside.

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll say, my
whole family is this way.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to
use food as a way

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:04.500 align:middle line:84%
to entertain myself,
be less bored,

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
be excited, have fun, be
engaged, be disengaged.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.900 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's so often.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't be enraged
when you're eating a pie.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.100 align:middle line:84%
You can't do both
at the same time.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't be deep
into grief when you're

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
eating a carton of ice cream.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I want the second
piece of cheesecake right now,

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.850 align:middle line:84%
or I want to go eat all of
the carrot cake right now,

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:29.232 align:middle line:84%
I deeply love and accept
and forgive myself.

01:10:29.232 --> 01:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And going through
the whole tapping

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:33.455 align:middle line:84%
mechanism to bring myself
to a state of peace.

01:10:33.455 --> 01:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that I can just
keep on tapping and keep

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
implementing this in my life
and spend time every day for me

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and not try to please
everybody else all the time.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.630 align:middle line:90%
I saw some movement.

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:46.560 align:middle line:90%
I saw it get worse.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I saw it get better
a little bit.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.843 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm leaving a little
better, a little less pain.

01:10:52.843 --> 01:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Probably one of
the biggest things

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that I learned this
four days was by tapping

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and by going through
this exercise

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
was trying to figure out who
I really am deep down inside,

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
not just who people think
I am or what is in my mind

01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and make decisions from
my heart and my intuition,

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.990 align:middle line:90%
rather than from my head.

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep tapping.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.660 align:middle line:90%
It works.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It's the tapping that works.

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times
people worry about,

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:19.000 align:middle line:90%
am I saying the right thing?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.233 align:middle line:84%
Or am I focused on
the right thing?

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're focused on something
that's bothering you,

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're tapping on
it, it's going to work.

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the emotional
part of my smoking,

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I believe that's gone.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But the addiction to the
nicotine is still there.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think with cutting
down now and controlling

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:43.865 align:middle line:84%
the emotional part of it
is going to help me quit.

01:11:43.865 --> 01:11:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The cravings went down, so he
knew immediately it would work

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:47.450 align:middle line:90%
on the craving.

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
The issue for him was, what
was he going to do instead?

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just about the
craving because we can crave

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.540 align:middle line:90%
anything.

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to act out on it.

01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's all the things that
are causing the craving.

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Addiction is-- the
reason why people

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
use a substance, alcohol,
drugs, or whatever,

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.015 align:middle line:90%
is because it works.

01:12:05.015 --> 01:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't work, they
wouldn't be using it.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only have I been just
stuck with these addictions,

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I also have been living
with just this horrible fear

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and so many scars that have just
caused me to act out so much

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
ever since I was raped
when I was younger.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I hurt my family
and hurt myself.

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've had nightmares honestly
every single night to the point

01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
where my husband doesn't
sleep in the same bed as me

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.300 align:middle line:90%
anymore because I scare him.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I shake at
night, or I start crying,

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%
or I scream in my dreams.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
This weekend is the first
three days, three nights

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
that I haven't had nightmares.

01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I think this was a life-changing
experience for everybody

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that attended here and maybe
for the people that watched.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.763 align:middle line:90%


01:13:07.763 --> 01:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're all looking
for something to help us feel

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%
better, but in a real way.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.690 align:middle line:90%
This isn't just taking a pill.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:18.118 align:middle line:84%
This is something we're engaged,
we're involved in this process.

01:13:18.118 --> 01:13:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're talking about
people with post-traumatic

01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
stress syndrome and just
really intense things or years

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of addictions, and they've tried
everything to get rid of it,

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.645 align:middle line:84%
and they do this process, and
in a couple of days or whatever

01:13:31.645 --> 01:13:32.770 align:middle line:90%
they have a dramatic shift.

01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
something going on there.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I consider it
the people's method.

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:39.850 align:middle line:90%
It's there for all of us.

01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And literally, at
our fingertips.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I just wish I'd
learned this 30 years ago,

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.160 align:middle line:90%
20 or 39 years ago.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just thankful
I have learned it now.

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.050 align:middle line:90%


01:13:56.050 --> 01:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's wonderful for nightmares
and anxiety that kids have

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:01.600 align:middle line:90%
going to school.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Kids are making up their
mind, we've got to change ours.

01:14:04.547 --> 01:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier
to make up your mind

01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:07.780 align:middle line:90%
than it is to change it.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So to be able to have the
resources where kids are able

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to clear out those kind
of traumas that day,

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.670 align:middle line:90%
right within a few hours.

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't even affect
the rest of their day,

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:23.897 align:middle line:84%
much less the rest
of their life.

01:14:23.897 --> 01:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I certainly hope that it
will be used in schools with

01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:27.030 align:middle line:90%
children.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's
a really wonderful--

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.238 align:middle line:84%
there's such a wonderful
opportunity there.

01:14:32.238 --> 01:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And what that person is going
to go on and achieve in life

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to
share their gifts and talents.

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
feeling blocked by the fact

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
that they were laughed at from
some simple little event that

01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
happens all the time.

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's where
things start, right?

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Something happens in
school and it upsets them,

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.102 align:middle line:84%
and they decide that the
older kids are always bad

01:14:50.102 --> 01:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
because of one thing that
happened with a bully

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.480 align:middle line:90%
in eighth grade.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we could just
collapse those conflicts

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and those events at
the end of every day

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
or the end of every
week, those children

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
would grow up with more
confidence, less insecurity,

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
less vulnerability to
being hurt by other people.

01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that every person
is born as a cell in this human

01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
body, and if we all
achieve our full potential,

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I might be a liver cell
and you're a kidney cell

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and someone's an eyeball cell
and someone else is a lung

01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:19.210 align:middle line:90%
cell.

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And if all the cells are doing
what they're supposed to do,

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:22.880 align:middle line:90%
then the whole world works.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The problem is when we
try to be what we're not

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
or try to deny what we really
truly feel and want to do,

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
that then we get like cancer
cells in the body that are not

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.640 align:middle line:84%
aligned with what the rest of
the purpose of the body is.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Our beliefs of competition
and warfare and struggle

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and survival completely
missed the point.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It's really based on loving,
harmony, thriving, community,

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.340 align:middle line:90%
cooperation.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.710 align:middle line:90%
These are the words of life.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> If I'm going around
and I'm at peace,

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm naturally going to
be nicer to other people.

01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:52.840 align:middle line:84%
If I'm being nicer
to other people,

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
then hopefully they're
going to pick up on that,

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be nice
to other people.

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you've
got this chain reaction.

01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It could transform the entire
culture because they'll have

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the tool, they'll be using it,
and then you'll be preventing

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.370 align:middle line:90%
future illness.

01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the ultimate prevention.

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's spreading so fast.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I think this will
be standard, kind

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
of like you know if you get the
hiccups and someone goes, boo,

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
because you know if you scare
yourself, your hiccups go away.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be as
common knowledge as that.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a spiritual
transition taking place

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.680 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.840 align:middle line:84%
People are starting
to understand spirit.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
People are starting
to understand energy.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
People are starting
to understand

01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:34.730 align:middle line:90%
them self as an energy field.

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they can work
with it to get the results they

01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:39.500 align:middle line:90%
want.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.480 align:middle line:84%
There are critics, and
there's quite a few,

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.660 align:middle line:90%
but they're changing very fast.

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't know about these
processes, these mechanisms,

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:50.472 align:middle line:84%
were ignorant of these facts,
and then things happen to us,

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:52.180 align:middle line:84%
of course, we don't
know what's going on.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And what can I do about it?

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Nobody told me.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But once you know,
then you can't

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.327 align:middle line:90%
go back and do that anymore.

01:16:59.327 --> 01:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You can say, OK, history,
everything that happened to me

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
up to this point,
I was oblivious to,

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I was ignorant of.

01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:05.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But from this point forward,
I'm going to take control.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.222 align:middle line:90%
Now I own my life.

01:17:12.222 --> 01:17:14.632 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:17:14.632 --> 01:17:20.416 align:middle line:90%


01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:22.826 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you?

01:17:22.826 --> 01:17:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And here's a man, right here.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:26.952 align:middle line:90%
>> You did such an awesome job.

01:17:26.952 --> 01:17:27.952 align:middle line:90%
>> How about you, buddy?

01:17:27.952 --> 01:17:29.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:17:29.094 --> 01:17:31.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, are you kidding?

01:17:31.487 --> 01:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie and I met at the
airport to fly in last night,

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and she said to me, are you
wearing a brace or a support

01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:37.470 align:middle line:90%
thing?

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought in my
mind, why would I?

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Really, I did.

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of like,
why would she ask that?

01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> But I guess she didn't
realize that literally since

01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that weekend-- and I
don't know which day.

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting hearing you
all say like, on the second day

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and on the first,
because in a way,

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that whole weekend was
a blur, but a good blur.

01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Not a, you know?

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know exactly
when it happened,

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:59.510 align:middle line:84%
but I just have never
had that back pain since.

01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So before when I would travel
and fly, I would always

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
have to wear some sort of a
brace or have all my patches,

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:08.980 align:middle line:84%
medicines, you name it,
you name it what you want.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have any
of that for this.

01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:12.023 align:middle line:90%
I think I have one little thing.

01:18:12.023 --> 01:18:14.697 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I don't wear
any sort of those things.

01:18:14.697 --> 01:18:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And Jackie was like, you
want me to take your bag?

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.988 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, no, I'm fine.

01:18:17.988 --> 01:18:19.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:20.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK, I am.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.017 align:middle line:90%
>> It's changed my whole life.

01:18:22.017 --> 01:18:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's changed my whole life.

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I see it in the
rest of us, too.

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I can work without hurting.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing, I can
do it without hurting.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%
I could never sit on the floor.

01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:34.852 align:middle line:90%
I could sit on the floor.

01:18:34.852 --> 01:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It was difficult
to get down there,

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:38.110 align:middle line:90%
but I could never get back up.

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It would be very, very
difficult to get back up.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But the last day, I come in,
and all the chairs were taken,

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.615 align:middle line:84%
and the only place to
sit was on the floor.

01:18:45.615 --> 01:18:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I was, well, let's try this.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I was on that floor
until late that night.

01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I kept waiting, thinking,
huh, the knee pain went away.

01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:57.430 align:middle line:90%
It's coming back.

01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It's coming back.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Never a twinge, nothing.

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Nothing came back.

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So that was an
absolute proof to me.

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I went for
walks and stuff, too.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.560 align:middle line:90%
But no pain whatsoever.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to put into
words how the feeling is after

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
so many years of being in so
much pain and then not having

01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:17.950 align:middle line:90%
it anymore.

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.478 align:middle line:90%
>> That whole weekend, nothing.

01:19:20.478 --> 01:19:21.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's been six months.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not coming back.

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It's completely gone.

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:26.488 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect that
to ever return.

01:19:26.488 --> 01:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> For so long I kind of felt
like I was on the outside

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.670 align:middle line:90%
looking in.

01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And now I feel like I belong.

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a shift
in consciousness,

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:39.107 align:middle line:84%
but it's a huge one for
me because it's just

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:39.940 align:middle line:90%
a different feeling.

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:41.357 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I
belong here, whereas

01:19:41.357 --> 01:19:43.862 align:middle line:84%
before, like in other
settings, I would just

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:45.070 align:middle line:90%
feel like an outsider, like--

01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:48.100 align:middle line:90%


01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes I find it
not hard, but challenging,

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:54.610 align:middle line:84%
when you're in the cancer center
getting back in treatments

01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
again, and I'm there almost
every day for this first month

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.620 align:middle line:90%
of my clinical trial I'm on.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're just surrounded with
not sick people, but basically

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.140 align:middle line:90%
chronically ill people.

01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can't help but go
there and sometimes just

01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
having that tool that you
can sit there in your chair,

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.760 align:middle line:84%
quietly tapping away,
and just working

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
through whether the emotion's
fear or anxiety or unknown.

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're not sure
what's happening in the future.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have
a sweets craving.

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat cake and
pies like I used to.

01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:29.890 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't even realize--

01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and I shared this also--

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even realized that
I go into Dunkin' Donuts

01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
almost every day, and
I never buy a donut.

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
I have to really assess

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here.

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Because II keep saying, well,
I'm not tapping regularly,

01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not tapping daily, and
I'm not getting the effects.

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But I do tap irregularly,
and I do tap occasionally.

01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And I do tap and grab moments.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I went from a
38 to a 36 again.

01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking to
get back to 34.

01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was a-- yeah,
all right, I was a 40.

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.244 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:10.244 --> 01:21:11.080 align:middle line:90%
I was a 40.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I went from a 40 to a 36, so I'm
back to my original 36 in three

01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:18.070 align:middle line:90%
months.

01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing about
the whole weekend,

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to
like say, conquer,

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:31.085 align:middle line:84%
was not to play back that
horrific day all the time.

01:21:31.085 --> 01:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
driving me nuts.

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:35.231 align:middle line:84%
And being able to
live with some pain--

01:21:35.231 --> 01:21:36.648 align:middle line:84%
because I live
with pain, you know

01:21:36.648 --> 01:21:38.148 align:middle line:84%
what I mean-- as I
speak to you now,

01:21:38.148 --> 01:21:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I still feel a little,
very little pain,

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that I know that
Raquel's not with me.

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:43.940 align:middle line:90%
But I know she is.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Somehow she is.

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I just like--

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
one thing my daughter
said to my wife,

01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:55.620 align:middle line:90%
she says, who is this man?

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:56.518 align:middle line:90%
I don't know him.

01:21:56.518 --> 01:21:59.660 align:middle line:90%


01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But she says, I like him
and I want to keep him.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:07.900 align:middle line:90%


01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
That was a big thing
for me, you know?

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of things
during that four days.

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:17.270 align:middle line:90%
