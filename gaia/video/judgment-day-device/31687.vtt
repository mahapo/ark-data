00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.405 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, I'm William Henry.

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:13.840 align:middle line:10%
I want to talk with you
today about my new book,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.750 align:middle line:10%
"The Judgment Day
Device," the lost

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:10%
secrets of the throne
of the Second Coming,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.500 align:middle line:10%
the Ark of the Covenant, and
the Messiah's End Time Kit.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:10%
The premise of my
book is that it's

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Judgment Day, not
the end of the world,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.242 align:middle line:10%
but certainly the end of
the world as we know it.

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:10%
In Christianity, Judgment
Day is in the Book

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:10%
of Revelation,
chapter 20, verse 12.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:10%
And this is where we stand
before the throne of Christ,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:10%
who is portrayed enthroned
on his rainbow ring.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
about this scenario

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
is that it's repeated
in other traditions.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Not just Christianity
anticipates the arrival

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
of a Messianic figure, but
so does Judaism and Islam.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:10%
All three anticipate the
imminent arrival of an End Time

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:10%
figure at Judgment Day.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:10%
But what most
people don't realize

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:10%
is that each of these
figures are symbolized

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.239 align:middle line:10%
by the same symbol or device,
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
When most people think of
the Ark of the Covenant

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
they think of a simple
golden box made by Moses

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.999 align:middle line:84%
at the base of Mount Sinai to
house the Ten Commandments.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
What most don't
realize is that there

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
were other tools
or implements that

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:90%
were contained within the Ark.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
These include the rod
of Aaron that budded,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the flask of manna,
and the [? cruise ?]

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
of sacred oil, an
oil that was rubbed

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
upon the body of the
priest and transformed them

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:90%
into illuminated beings.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
The Ark was actually crafted
by a master craftsman

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Bezalel, who was
given wisdom directly by God

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and then was given a pattern
to make the Ark, which

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
was to be a copy of
a heavenly original.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask, why would
God gives this craftsman

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
such incredible wisdom
if he was simply

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:90%
making a simple golden box?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a tip that there is
something far more profound

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
going on with the
Ark the Covenant.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
The Ark is a copy of
the heavenly original.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, John the Revelator
said that he saw heaven open

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and saw the Ark of
the Covenant located

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:90%
at the throne of Christ.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So we now know there are at
least two Arks of the Covenant.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
There is the one in heaven
and the one on earth.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a tip that we are to
follow the ancient adage, "As

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
above, so below, as
within, so without."

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Later in the program
I'm going to show

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.457 align:middle line:84%
you the inner Ark
of the Covenant.

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk for a moment, though,
about the Ark of the Covenant

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:90%
in more detail.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
What most Jews, Christians,
and Islamic people

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
don't realize about
the Ark of the Covenant

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
is that there are two
scholarly trends about the Ark.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.260 align:middle line:84%
One says that it's
a simple golden box,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
but the other says
that it is actually

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.031 align:middle line:90%
the throne of a God being.

00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And in our presentation we're
going to look at the Ark

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
as the throne of
the Christ Messiah,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:90%
or Islamic Messiah, the Mahdi.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
In these traditions,
an illuminated being

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
is shown sitting on
the throne, which

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:84%
is in fact the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:10%
The Israelites carry the
Ark during their 40 years

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:10%
of wandering in the wilderness.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
During this time, the Ark acted
as a multi-purpose device.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to call it a device
because the word "device" means

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
a tool, an appliance, but it
also means a sign and a symbol.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Ark of the
Covenant, to the Israelites,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
was a sign of God's
divine presence.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Joshua used the Ark
as a tool or device

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:90%
to part the River Jordan.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And in this wonderful
painting by James Tissot

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
we see the Israelite
priest, dressed in white,

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
carrying the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
In this painting we
see two key details

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:90%
that will become very important.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
One, we see that the Ark
is, in fact, feathered.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.479 align:middle line:84%
Two, we see the two
cherubim on either side

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Ark of the
Covenant with their wings

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:90%
touching one another.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Joshua also used the Ark of
the Covenant to take Jericho.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
In this painting by John
Martin in the National

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Gallery in Washington,
D.C., we see

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Joshua causing the
sun to stand still.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:10%
The Israelite priest utilized
the Ark of the Covenant

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:10%
as a tool or device
that helps Joshua

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:10%
to accomplish this
extraordinary feat.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:10%
A key detail is that the two
cherubim on top of the Ark

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:10%
had wingspans that touched.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.045 align:middle line:10%
These wingspans are estimated
to be about 15 feet.

00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:10%
And it was between
these two cherubim

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:10%
that Yahweh would manifest
on his Ark throne.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant manifests

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
what's called the mystical
Shekinah, the divine glory

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:90%
or the divine presence.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
This divine presence is
visualized as either a rainbow

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
or as a brilliant
beam of light that

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:84%
emanates from the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish mystical
book the Zohar,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
this pillar or beam
of light serves

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
as a conduit for the ascent
of the souls of the righteous

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:90%
to paradise.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It's called the foundation
of the Mount of Sion, which

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is thought of as
a cosmic center.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The pillar of light
or conduit emanates

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
from the Ark of the
Covenant, and is

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
thought of as the throne of God.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
In Jewish mysticism, the
term "tzadik" or "righteous"

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
is also given to the
cosmic pillar, as well as

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:90%
the ones who scale it to heaven.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
What we must fill in
is the realization

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that this luminous
pillar is in fact

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
a portal through which
the righteous ones pass

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:90%
to the heavenly Sion and return.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
This pillar is thought of
as an incandescent pillar

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
at the center of Eden that is
utilized as a transportation

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:84%
portal for these
righteous beings.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a conduit for
these righteous souls that

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
transports them to this
heavenly place, where they

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
are transformed into angels
and returned to earth.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
In this amazing painting we
see the Israelites lined up,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
approaching the Ark
of the Covenant, which

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
has the pillar of righteousness
shooting from within it.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the portal
that they will

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:90%
scale to the heavenly Sion.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
In Jewish tradition
it was King David

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
who brought the Ark of
the Covenant to Jerusalem.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
It was his son, Solomon,
who built a temple

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.432 align:middle line:84%
to house the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:06:47.432 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:84%
In the next chapter
I'm going to show you

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:84%
why I believe Solomon's Temple
is in fact Solomon's Stargate.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>The temple of
Solomon was constructed

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:90%
atop Jerusalem's Mt.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Moriah, which is
also called Sion.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
The temple itself was
divided into two areas.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The outer part of the temple
was called the Holy Place.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
A short staircase or ramp
led into the Most Holy Place,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
which is where the Ark of
the Covenant was located.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:84%
the Most Holy Place is
actually a cube-shaped room

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:90%
that was lined with gold.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
A veil separated the Holy
Place from the Most Holy Place.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Holy of Holies and Most Holy
mark an important distinction.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Things or persons
can become holy.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Something that is Most
Holy has the ability

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
to actively impart holiness or
cause something to become holy.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it was in the Most Holy
place, the Ark of the Covenant

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
itself had the ability to
actively impart holiness.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the golden cube-shaped
room itself imparted holiness.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It made those who entered
into it holy people, or what

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
we might even think
of as angelic beings.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
The Most Holy Place
was the secret chamber

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:90%
of the high priest.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:90%
And only they knew its secrets.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
At the dedication of
the Temple of Solomon

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant was
moved into the Most Holy Place.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible describes how a
cloud of glory, the Shekinah

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Presence or Divine
Presence filled

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
the golden cube-shaped room.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
When the high priest
entered the Most Holy Place

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
he wore specially
designed clothing

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that was, in fact, made
of the same material

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
as the veil that separated
the Holy Place from the Most

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Holy Place.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The veil symbolized
the veil of matter.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And when the high priest
crossed through the veil,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:84%
he was entering into
the sacred realms.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Central to my thesis is Dr.
Margaret Barker's proposal

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:10%
that the veil represented
a boundary between heaven

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:10%
and earth, between the material
and the immaterial realm

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:10%
between time and eternity.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:10%
The veil represented
matter, which veils humanity

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:10%
from the presence of God.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Parting this veil took one
beyond the material world.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Philo says that the veil
separated the changeable parts

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
of the world from the
heavenly region, which

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.270 align:middle line:84%
is without transient
events and is unchanging.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:10%
The people who passed through
the veil, notes Barker,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:10%
were the mediators,
divine inhuman,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:10%
clad in the priestly garments,
who walked between worlds

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:10%
to bring blessings and the
presence of God to the people.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It was believed that those who
entered the most holy place

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
entered heaven alive,
and were transformed

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
entering that chamber.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
In Barker's view,
Solomon's Temple

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
was a place where
pilgrims would come

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
to be anointed so that
they, too, could come face

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
to face with the
presence of God.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
The transformed humans who
received this anointing

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and entered the Most Holy
Place entered it alive,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
were transformed, and then
returned to the material world.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:90%
They were called angels.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the priests
who received this anointing

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and experienced
this transformation

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
were called the priests after
the order of Melchizedek.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
As the Melchizedek high
priest went beyond the veil

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and entered the Holy of
Holies, he entered heaven.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And when he passed
back through the veil

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%
he came down from heaven.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Barker tells how these
people became angels and lights

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:90%
among the living.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Is this experience literal
or is it metaphorical?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it was
a literal experience,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that they who entered
this golden chamber

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:84%
were transformed by the
tools and implements

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
in that room, especially
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
As the priest forever after
the order of Melchizedek,

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is believed to have been
one of these high priests.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this painting by
the German painter Wilhelm von

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Kaulbach is so important.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:84%
We see the Israelite
priest carrying

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:90%
In the background is Jerusalem.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And above the Ark we see
Jesus among some other saintly

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:84%
beings, including Mary
and John the Baptist.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the Ark
of the Covenant

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
was used to open a
portal or a gateway that

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
leads to Sion, the
heavenly throne of Christ.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Christ is shown as
an illuminated being,

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:84%
as a light being,
because this is the form

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.652 align:middle line:84%
that all of the
resurrected beings take.

00:12:02.652 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant is believed

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
to have remained in
the Most Holy Place

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.030 align:middle line:90%
until approximately 570 BC.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:10%
That's when the Babylonian
king, Nebuchadnezzar,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:10%
came to Jerusalem, leveled
the Temple of Solomon,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:10%
looted it of its
treasure, including,

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:10%
it's believed, the
Ark, and took it back

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.590 align:middle line:10%
to Babylon with them
along with the wise men

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:10%
from the Temple of Solomon.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Among the wise men that
were taken to Babylon

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:10%
were the prophets
Daniel and Ezekiel.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:84%
It was Ezekiel who had the
incredible vision of God

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:90%
on his flying throne.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:10%
It was during the
Babylonian captivity

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:10%
that the Jews began to
prophesy about the appearance

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:10%
of a Messiah who would
return them to Sion

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:10%
and would reclaim the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:10%
as well as the other tools or
implements housed within it--

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:10%
the rod of Aaron,
the flask of manna,

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:10%
and the [? crews ?]
of anointing oil.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The Jews still await the
appearance of this Messiah.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
However, some believe this
figure's return is imminent.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:84%
According to Jewish
legend, the Messiah

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
will reassemble the
complete Ark of the Covenant

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and will reveal the
secret of redemption.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
The secret of
redemption has to do

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
with the transformation
of the human body

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
into its resurrected form,
what is known as the glory body

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:90%
or resurrection body.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Images of Christ
resurrecting from the tomb

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
affirm this ancient
belief that the human body

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
can be transformed
into a being of light.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
In a moment we're
going to explore

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
the incredible possibility that
the tomb that Christ is shown

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
rising from is actually
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Did Jesus secretly recover
the Ark of the Covenant

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and use it in the transformation
chamber in the Most Holy Place?

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.394 align:middle line:90%
We'll find out.

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:55.286 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:55.286 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.370 align:middle line:10%
>>It is generally
accepted by Islam

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:10%
that the Islamic
Messiah, the Mahdi,

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:10%
will be the one to recover
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:10%
His name, the Mahdi,
means "the guided one,"

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:10%
because it is believed he will
be guided by Allah to recover

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:10%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:10%
In Islamic prophecy the Mahdi
will be accompanied by Jesus.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:10%
Together they will recover
the Ark of the Covenant

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:10%
and will reveal it to
the world in Jerusalem.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant will
be recovered by the Mahdi

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and will be taken
to Jerusalem, where

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:84%
it will be the sign and
symbol of his sovereignty

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:90%
as well as his dominion.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
For Muslims, the
Ark of the Covenant

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
will be the sign of a
great new age of peace,

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
prosperity, and
rapid advancement

00:14:54.830 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
in human civilization that
will be ruled by the Mahdi.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It will be returned
to the sacred rock

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:90%
atop Jerusalem's Mt.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.565 align:middle line:84%
Moriah, the place where it once
rested in the Most Holy Place.

00:15:07.565 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It was from this sacred spot
that the prophet Mohammed

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
ascended to the throne of God
aboard his magic horse, called

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Al-Buraq.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Today the interior of
the Dome of the Rock

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
features imagery and symbolism
that reinforces the idea

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that it is a portal
or a gateway,

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
just as it was in
the ancient world.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Is the Dome of the
Rock this place

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%
marking the most sacred spot to
Jews, Christians, and Muslims,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
in fact a portal or gateway to
another region of space time,

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the throne
of God in the ancient text?

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Millions believe that it is.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it is the
most highly contested dot

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.565 align:middle line:90%
of real estate on earth.

00:15:52.565 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The recovery of the Ark of
the Covenant by the Mahdi

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:84%
is regarded by Islamic
scholars as heralding

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
a time when Quranic moral
values will prevail on earth.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
In the Qur'an, the Ark
of the Covenant is a sign

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
for the faithful and is
described in these terms.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
"Mohammed, their
prophet, said to them,

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
'The sign of his kingship is
that the Ark will come to you,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
containing serenity from your
Lord and certain relics left

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
by the families
of Musa and Harun.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:90%
It will be borne by angels.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a sign in that
for you if you believe.'"

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
One who believes is Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, the president

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
of Iran, who believes
it is his divine mission

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to cause cosmic jihad
in order to hasten

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.620 align:middle line:84%
the arrival of the
Mahdi and therefore

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
the arrival of the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:10%
But in order for the Mahdi
to arrive in Islamic prophecy

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:10%
it is believed that there must
be a major cataclysmic event.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:10%
Some believe that Iran's
nuclear weapons program

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:10%
is designed to
facilitate or hasten

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:10%
the arrival of the Mahdi.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:10%
So does the government
of Iran actually want war

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:10%
on a global scale,
chaos on a global scale,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:10%
because that's what
the prophecy says

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:10%
for the arrival of the Mahdi?

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.232 align:middle line:10%
Is Iran presently seeking
the Ark of the Covenant?

00:17:27.232 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:10%
Does it possess they
Ark of the Covenant,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:10%
and will it be revealing
it to the world?

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:10%
As crazy as that sounds,
the vast majority

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:10%
of people around the
world have no idea

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:10%
how obsessed the
Iranian government

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:10%
is with its brand of
Shia Islam and the belief

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.140 align:middle line:10%
that it can hasten the
arrival of the Mahdi

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:10%
by creating global chaos.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:10%
The Shia Muslims believe
that the arrival of the Mahdi

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:10%
is imminent.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:10%
And that means the
return of Jesus

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:10%
is imminent as well,
along with the appearance

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:10%
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It surprises many to learn
that the Iranian government's

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
official websites are
filled with information

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
about the imminent
arrival of the Mahdi.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
The Islamic Republic of
Iran Broadcasting website

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
said, in a program called "The
World Towards Illumination,"

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
that the Mahdi will form an army
to defeat the enemies of Islam

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
in a series of
apocalyptic battles

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in which the Mahdi will overcome
his arch villain in Jerusalem.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Likely this figure
will be carrying

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The Iranian regime
believes that it

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
can hasten the
arrival of the Mahdi

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
by destroying the
little Satan, Israel,

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and the great Satan,
the United States.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:10%
Since 2010 the Ayatollah
Khomeini, Iran's Supreme

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:10%
religious leader, has been
telling the Iranian people

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:10%
that he has been in
contact with the Mahdi

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:10%
and has in fact
met him personally.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:10%
And the Mahdi has assured him
that he will manifest on earth

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:10%
during the Ayatollah's lifetime.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:10%
In July 2012, the
Ayatollah Khomeini

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:10%
told the Iranian people to
prepare for the End Times.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
On September 26, 2012, on Yom
Kippur, the day of Atonement,

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:84%
the day when the Israelite high
priest would enter the Most

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Holy Place and address
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
addressed the United Nations

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and told the world to prepare
for the imminent arrival

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:90%
of the Mahdi.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:10%
Ahmadinejad said that the
arrival of the Savior figure

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:10%
would mark a new
beginning for humanity,

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:10%
an age of rebirth
and resurrection.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Is the Ark of the Covenant soon
to be revealed in our world?

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the
Ark of the Covenant

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
has been lost for centuries
suggests that it may never

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
be found, has secretly been
found, possibly even by Jesus,

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
or may be awaiting a
time, such as our own,

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
when so many signs and
warnings of the End Times

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:90%
have been fulfilled.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:10%
What most don't realize is
that the Ark of the Covenant

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.260 align:middle line:10%
is just one component
of a larger supernatural

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:10%
device I call the
Judgment Day Device.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:10%
This complete Ark
will be the sign

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.951 align:middle line:10%
of the Christ Messiah or Mahdi.

00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:10%
>>So let's talk about
this complete device.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:10%
To fully understand it, we have
to begin with the realization

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:10%
that the Ark of the
Covenant was thought

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:10%
of as the throne of the
Israelite God, Yahweh.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.920 align:middle line:10%
In Israelite thought, Yahweh is
imagined on an immense throne

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:10%
in the Most Holy Place
of Solomon's Temple

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:10%
with his feet propped on the
Ark of the Covenant, which

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:10%
serves as his footstool.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
This Ark slash footstool is
in fact the throne of Yahweh.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:84%
A most influential
text is Ezekiel,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:84%
which describes the being
on the throne as something

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:90%
that seemed like human form.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The prophet goes on to
describe this human-like figure

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
in detail, especially
focusing on his luminosity.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
A rainbow surrounded the
throne and the figure.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
It was covered in fire.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah also saw a human
form on the throne.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
"In the year that
King Uzziah died,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I saw the Lord sitting upon
a throne, high and lifted up.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And his train filled the temple.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And above him stood
the seraphim."

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
This fourth century BC depiction
of Yahweh on his throne

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
portrays that throne as a
winged ring, because it flies.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
This flying throne
or winged throne

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
is known as the Merkabah
vehicle, the Throne Chariot.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It's from the word
"Merkabah" that we in fact

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:84%
get our word "cab,"
which means "vehicle."

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:84%
What we realize is that the Ark
of the Covenant and the throne

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:90%
are equated.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:90%
The Bible tells us this.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
"Therefore, hear the
word of the Lord.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I saw the Lord
sitting on his throne.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So the people sent
to Shiloh and brought

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:84%
from there the Ark of the
Covenant of the Lord of Hosts,

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
who is enthroned
on the cherubim.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:84%
were there with the
Ark of the Covenant."

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:84%
The Lord's Throne is
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Merkabah, or throne
chariot, literature

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
describes the
seraphim beings that

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.610 align:middle line:84%
accompany the Ark
of the Covenant

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:84%
in the heavenly temple,
meaning they surround

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
the heavenly Ark
of the Covenant.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Here's what it says.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
"Their walking is like the
appearance of a lightning bolt.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:84%
A vision of them is like
a vision of a rainbow.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Their faces are like
a vision of a bride.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:10%
Their wings are
like the radiance

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:10%
of the clouds of glory."

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:10%
Remember, the Ark
of the Covenant

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.010 align:middle line:10%
manifests the Shekinah Glory
or the Divine Presence,

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:10%
which is visualized
as a rainbow.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
On either side of the Ark
are these rainbow beings,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:90%
the seraphim.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The seraphim are considered to
be the highest order of angels.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.655 align:middle line:84%
They are beings of pure
light and pure love.

00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And in certain
traditions they're

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
viewed as transformed
humans, humans

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:84%
who have completed the
cycle of earthly evolution

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and have transformed
themselves into light beings

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and now dwell at
the throne of God,

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
where the heavenly
Ark is located.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:84%
In this example here
we see Christ ascending

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
above an Ark-like box, in
an almond-shaped gateway

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
or a mandorla,
filled with light.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
On either side of them are the
rainbow beings, the seraphim.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The seraphim are shown
in Judeo Christian

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:84%
art as having six
wings and also swirling

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:90%
or vortex-shaped shaped bodies.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The description of
the seraphim as beings

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of light with swirling
vortex-shaped bodies

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is strikingly similar to the way
the Tibetans portray their most

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:84%
advanced teaching, the Great
Perfection, or Rainbow Body

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:84%
In this teaching we're told
that the human body can

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
be spun into a vortex of energy
that ultimately manifests

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:84%
as five-colored rainbow light,
leaving behind only hair,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
toe, and fingernails that have
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the seraphim
are in fact rainbow body

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
beings, humans who've
achieved the highest

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
level of human evolution and
now dwell at the throne of God

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:90%
as rainbow beings?

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
What intrigues me about this is
that the Tibetan rainbow body

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:84%
seems to match the Christian
concept of the resurrection

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:90%
body or glory body.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
When Christ is shown resurrected
he is shown either in a rainbow

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:90%
or on a rainbow.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:84%
He is in glory, meaning
he is glowing rays,

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:90%
glowing rainbow light.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
The interchange of these
images makes it clear

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are describing
beings who've

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
achieved the ultimate
human transformation.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
What is the role
of the complete Ark

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant in
this transformation?

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:90%
We'll soon find out.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
One thing seems
clear, and that is

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that the resurrection body, the
redeemed body, the glory body,

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:84%
or the rainbow body is
the form in which we

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
will ride the beam that emanates
from the Ark of the Covenant.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
This beam, or pillar of
righteousness as it's called,

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
is featured in this painting
by Hieronymus Bosch.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Painted in 1600 AD,
it's thought to contain

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the Cathars
of Southern France.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars claimed that they
possessed a secret teaching

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
that once belonged to
Jesus and the disciples

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.600 align:middle line:90%
about resurrection.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
In the painting we
see Saint Jerome

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
praying before a traditional
image of the Catholic crucifix.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:84%
This time, though, it's
attached to a throne.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Highly intriguing.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.610 align:middle line:84%
In the lower left-hand
corner is what the Cathars

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:84%
may have called the Christ
column, or the column of glory.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Scholars believe Jesus
referred to this Christ column

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:84%
or tube of light in
the book of John.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:84%
"I tell you the truth,
you shall see heaven open

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and the angels of God
ascending and descending

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:90%
on the Son of Man."

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So the heavens have
opened, via something--

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant?--
and we now know that this tube

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:84%
of light is also
called the Son of Man.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
this tube of light

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:84%
is what Jacob saw in
the book of Genesis

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:84%
when he fell into a
dream and saw a ladder

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:84%
or stairway reaching into
the heavens with angels

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
ascending and descending
on either side.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Jacob scaled that
ladder, got to the top,

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and saw [? El ?] looking
back down on him.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Jacob awoke from his
dream, set up the pillow

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that he had his head upon as a
pillar, anointed it with oil,

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and declared that this is none
other than the House of God

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and this is the gate to heaven.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:84%
It appears to me
that Jacob may have

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:90%
been assembling a sort of a kit.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
He took his pillow,
set it up as a pillar,

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and poured oil on top of it.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that the
beam of light coming

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
from the Ark of the Covenant and
the tube of light in Hieronymus

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Bosch's painting
are representative

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:90%
of the same thing.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case, then
the Christ column or column

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
of glory in Bosch's painting
is in fact resting upon

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
or attached to the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:84%
This is our first reference
to the complete Ark

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant, which we
will see again in a moment.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:10%
Bosch seemed to
have known something

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:10%
very important about
riding this beam.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:10%
That is that we won't ride
it in flesh and blood form.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:10%
Rather, we will acquire a
garment of light or light body

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:10%
before we embark
on this journey.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:84%
In the background we
see the Cathar initiate

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:84%
receiving a cloak or garment
of light from an angel.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
This prepares this figure
to kneel before Christ,

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:84%
who is also portrayed
as a being of light.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
garment of light

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:84%
that John the Baptist
transmitted to Jesus

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:90%
during his baptism.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:84%
It is believed in Judeo
Christian tradition

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that John the Baptist is
in fact the reincarnation

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of the biblical prophet Elijah,
the forerunner of the Messiah.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Elijah is called a
translated being.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that
he has transformed himself

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:90%
into a higher form beyond human.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:84%
A translated being
is one who can

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:84%
materialize and
dematerialize at will

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and travel the universe in
a fiery chariot or Merkabah

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:90%
throne.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is what
we see in Jewish art

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:90%
of the ascension of Elijah.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.210 align:middle line:84%
He rides into the heavens
on his Merkabah throne.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:84%
He rides into the heavens on
his Merkabah throne chariot.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
As he ascends, he turns
to his priesthood Elisha

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and transmits his holy garment,
his power garment or miracle

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:84%
garment, which is the same as
Christ's light body garment.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the same garment that
John the Baptist transmitted

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.440 align:middle line:90%
to Christ at the baptism.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.650 align:middle line:84%
After the baptism, Jesus
took several disciples up

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:84%
to the top of a mountain
and, in a moment

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:84%
called the Transfiguration,
he changed his form.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:84%
He metamorphosed into a shining
or radiant being of light,

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
symbolized by his
bright white garment.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:84%
A portal or gateway
opened behind him.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly Moses and Elijah
appeared as if out of thin air.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.950 align:middle line:84%
What they are
demonstrating for us here

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:84%
is the ability that
translated beings

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.780 align:middle line:84%
possess, the ability
to phase back and forth

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:84%
between the material and
the immaterial realm,

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.300 align:middle line:84%
because they know the
secret of the throne

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:90%
chariot or Merkabah metaphysics.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
The robe of light itself
is an important symbol

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of this Merkabah metaphysics.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.490 align:middle line:90%
There are several names for it.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Robe of
Sanctity, the Robe of Glory,

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:84%
the Shining Garment,
the Garment of Light.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But my favorite term
is the Beaming Garment.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Because when we put
on the Beaming Garment

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:90%
we literally radiate light.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And we may even have the ability
to beam through the universe.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:84%
A Greek term that describes
the attributes of this garment

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:90%
is the word "exusia."

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
It means power, jurisdiction,
capacity, strength,

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and liberty.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:84%
This is our motivation for
pursuing these mysteries.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Because as we put on this
garment of light ourself,

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:84%
we acquire true power, true
capacity, true strength,

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and true liberty.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:84%
This Robe of Glory
is the garment

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of light worn by
the Cathar initiate

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
as it rises through the Christ
column or tube of light.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:84%
400 years after
Hieronymus Bosch,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Gene Roddenberry invented
the idea of beaming.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the ancients knew

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.140 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of dematerializing
the body into light

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and beaming it
across the universe,

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and we are only today
rediscovering what they already

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.430 align:middle line:90%
knew?

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that another
painting by Hieronymus Bosch

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.710 align:middle line:84%
also is an image of the tube of
light or the column of glory.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.830 align:middle line:84%
The painting is called "The
Ascent into the Empyrean."

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And what we see
is an initiate who

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.650 align:middle line:84%
is rising from the earth
plane, the material realm.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And as this figure rises it
becomes less and less material,

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:84%
until it is completely
naked, indicating

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.390 align:middle line:90%
that it is in a light body form.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It is in this form
that the figure

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.700 align:middle line:84%
enters into the tube
or tunnel of light that

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:90%
is composed of concentric rings.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.164 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the tube or
tunnel is a being of light.

00:32:19.164 --> 00:32:20.830 align:middle line:84%
The incredible thing
about this painting

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:84%
is that people who have
had a near death experience

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:84%
report seeing such
a tunnel of light.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible
that this tunnel

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:32.030 align:middle line:84%
is in fact what we today call
a stargate or a wormhole.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Something that's
very important to us

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:84%
is that those who have
had near death experiences

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.460 align:middle line:84%
report immense feelings
of love and joy

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
emanating from this tunnel,
as well as the beings of light

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:90%
that they see in this tunnel.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's likely that immense
feelings of love and joy

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:84%
accompany us as we
enter this tube.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.860 align:middle line:90%
So how close are we to beaming?

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is
that quantum teleportation

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
has been proven
experimentally over and over.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Though it may be
disappointing to hear,

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
quantum teleportation is not
yet about instantly sending

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
a person or object
between two places.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's no
"Beam me up, Scotty" yet.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:84%
However, what they're
doing is something

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.940 align:middle line:90%
absolutely extraordinary.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
They're separating
a subatomic particle

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:90%
from the quantum state.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And once you disembody
the state of one particle,

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
you can then recreate the
particle in a remote copy.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:84%
What they're suggesting is that
a beaming device would scan us,

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
make a copy of us
at another location.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Ark of
the Covenant on earth

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
is a copy of the
heavenly original.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the Ark of the Covenant

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:84%
was some form of an ancient
scanning device, whereby

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:84%
copies of individuals
were beamed

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:90%
from Earth to the heavenly Sion?

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.490 align:middle line:84%
If so then we are on the verge
of recreating the Judgment Day

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Device.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:14.909 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:10%
>>So let's return
to the ancient world

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:10%
for evidence of the ancient
Judgment Day Device.

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:22.969 align:middle line:10%
Some believe that the
Ark of the Covenant

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:10%
had Egyptian antecedents.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:84%
In this example here from the
temple of Rameses II at Abydos,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.330 align:middle line:84%
we see what's called
the [INAUDIBLE] shrine,

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
the power shrine, the
symbol of upper Egypt

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:37.889 align:middle line:84%
that is carried on poles exactly
like the Ark of the Covenant.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
This shrine resembles
in form, and I

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.179 align:middle line:84%
believe in function,
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that in
fact the Egyptians did

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.489 align:middle line:84%
have a form of Ark
of the Covenant.

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:50.780 align:middle line:84%
We compare the ancient
Egyptian version

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:84%
with James Tissot's version
of the Ark of the Covenant

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.139 align:middle line:84%
and see that they're
a very close match.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:58.440 align:middle line:84%
At the temple of
Medinet Habu we see

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.860 align:middle line:84%
the pharaoh enshrined on
a throne inside the Ark,

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.550 align:middle line:84%
combining the Ark
and the throne.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:84%
In this example from the
temple at Medinet Habu,

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:84%
we see the pharaoh on his throne
chair, his winged throne chair,

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that is in fact placed within
the [INAUDIBLE] shrine,

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.210 align:middle line:84%
which could be an early version
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.600 align:middle line:84%
In a second example
from Medinet Habu

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.970 align:middle line:84%
the Ark shrine is
attached to the Ark

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:90%
of the Millions of Years.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.930 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt it
was believed that one

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:84%
could enter the
realm of the gods

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.390 align:middle line:84%
through a ladder or stairway or
via the pharaoh's throne, which

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.810 align:middle line:90%
could fly.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
This is why the pharaoh's
throne, or the throne of Osiris

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:84%
in particular, was shown
with feathers on it.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:84%
The feathered throne
reminds us once again

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
of Tissot's version of
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Osiris sits on the
feathered throne.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.980 align:middle line:84%
He wears his
tight-fitting holy garment

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.110 align:middle line:90%
called his crossed garment.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.850 align:middle line:84%
It's pure white, again reminding
us of the Transfiguration

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:84%
garment or the robe
of light of Christ.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Osiris's face is
green, indicating

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that he is the god of rebirth,
renewal, and resurrection.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.470 align:middle line:10%
The passion of
Osiris is reflected

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:18.640 align:middle line:10%
in his name, Wennefer, the One
Who Continues To Be Perfect,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:10%
which alludes to his
post-mortem power.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.140 align:middle line:10%
Osiris is portrayed
as a perfected one.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible
that he too is one

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:10%
who has achieved the perfect
body or the rainbow body?

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:10%
The connection between Osiris
and the Tibetan rainbow body

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.660 align:middle line:10%
tradition once again
suggests that in order

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:10%
to travel upon the
throne into the stars,

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:10%
we must first manifest our
glory body or resurrection body.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is no coincidence
that the resurrected Christ,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.540 align:middle line:84%
the resurrected Osiris, and the
perfected Lama in the Tibetan

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:84%
rainbow body tradition all
manifest the same light body.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.920 align:middle line:84%
For additional evidence we
turn to the temple of Hathor

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.210 align:middle line:90%
at Dendera.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:10%
There, on the incredible
astronomical ceiling,

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.090 align:middle line:10%
we see celestial
beings, transformed

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.880 align:middle line:10%
humans riding upon the Ark
of the Millions of Years

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.770 align:middle line:10%
into eternity.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.980 align:middle line:84%
They sit upon their
feathered throne,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.459 align:middle line:84%
which is attached to the Ark or
Bark of the Millions of Years.

00:37:25.459 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
What I would propose
is that we're actually

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
complete Ark throne.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:84%
As they sit on this
feathered throne

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
they are transformed beings
who've achieved the light body

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.250 align:middle line:84%
form and are now traveling for
eternity on the Ark or Bark

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.630 align:middle line:90%
of the Millions of Years.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The amazing thing about the
Ark of the Millions of Years

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is the way it compares to the
way modern science portrays

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:90%
a wormhole.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.630 align:middle line:84%
In this artist
visualization we see

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.280 align:middle line:84%
a of warp craft entering
the mouth of a wormhole.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.050 align:middle line:84%
It travels through the throat
of the wormhole and exits

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.200 align:middle line:84%
at the other side in what
could be another dimension

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
or millions of
lightyears of space time.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The warp craft is able to
travel through the wormhole

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:84%
across these vast distances as
if there's nothing in between.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.480 align:middle line:84%
In this example, we see
the U shape of the wormhole

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.370 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.110 align:middle line:90%
We enter the mouth on the left.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
We travel through the throat
of the wormhole and exit

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.660 align:middle line:90%
on the mouth on the right.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:84%
What I have done is taken
this modern depiction

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.986 align:middle line:84%
of the wormhole and
superimposed it over the imagery

00:38:27.986 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that we find on the ceiling
at the temple up Hathor

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:90%
at Dendera.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is a perfect match

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.100 align:middle line:84%
between the symbolism
of the wormhole

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
Egyptian depiction

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Ark of the
Millions of Years.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:10%
Once again, it's asking us
to consider the possibility

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.140 align:middle line:10%
that the ancient
Egyptian gods knew

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:10%
how to transform themselves
into celestial or star beings

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:10%
and travel the stars for
eternity through wormholes.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.794 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:55.794 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:90%


00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.500 align:middle line:10%
>>What most Christians
don't realize

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:10%
is that Christ is also
shown ascending or traveling

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:10%
through the stars
on an ark throne.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Earlier we looked at this
image of the seraphim

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:10%
on either side of the
Ark of the Covenant

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.530 align:middle line:10%
with the Shekinah
rainbow in between.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:10%
We noted the key detail,
that their wing tips touch.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, compare that with this
image of Christ on his throne.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:84%
We note that he's sitting
on a throne with his feet

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:30.860 align:middle line:90%
on a footstool.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the Ark of the Covenant.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Angels are on either side of
him, and their wing tips touch.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a clear sign to
scholars that, in fact, Christ

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.560 align:middle line:90%
is sitting on the ark throne.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:10%
As we look around
Christian art we

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:49.400 align:middle line:10%
see other compelling examples
of Christ on the ark throne.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.790 align:middle line:10%
In this example from ancient
Egypt from the fourth century,

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:10%
to be precise, we see Christ
sitting on his throne.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.470 align:middle line:10%
He has his feet on
the footstool, which

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.590 align:middle line:10%
means once again we're talking
about the Ark of the Covenant.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:10%
He's in the concentric rings,
which symbolize the portal.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:10%
He is portrayed ascending
on the Ark throne

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.840 align:middle line:10%
through this pillar
or tunnel of light.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.020 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what we saw
in Hieronymus Bosch's painting

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:84%
of the tube of light
or the Christ column.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
all of these scenes

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.470 align:middle line:84%
are portraying the same event
from a different perspective?

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.660 align:middle line:90%
One shows it from a side view.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Another shows it
from the face view.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And another actually
shows us entering

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:90%
into that tunnel or portal.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's clear to me that
Jesus is, in fact,

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.760 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.660 align:middle line:90%
It's his ascension vehicle.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.530 align:middle line:84%
This thought is contrary to
traditional Christian teaching.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back and compare
the early Christian images

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:90%
to the Egyptian images.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.560 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian image
shows the pharaoh

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:84%
on his feathered
throne, his Ark throne,

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
attached to the Ark of
the Millions of Years,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
traveling as a celestial
being through the stars.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:10%
Christian imagery shows the
same story from the face on.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:10%
Christ is on his Ark
throne, traveling

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.665 align:middle line:10%
through the tube of light.

00:41:10.665 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.150 align:middle line:84%
In this example from Russia,
we see Christ enthroned.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:19.270 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting on the
lap of the Father.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The seraphim are on either
side of this throne.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
The Father's feet
are on the footstool,

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:84%
indicating once
again that this is

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
flanked by the seraphim.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:84%
In this detail we see that the
footstool is in fact winged.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:39.160 align:middle line:84%
These are the wheels
of Ezekiel's chariot,

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:84%
also called the
Merkabah chariot,

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.890 align:middle line:84%
affirming once again that
Christ's throne is in fact

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:48.580 align:middle line:90%
the Merkabah chariot.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:52.870 align:middle line:84%
All three of these images
portray the ark throne.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is clear that this
ark throne or Merkabah

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
throne is, in fact,
the throne of Christ.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:90%
It is his ascension vehicle.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.920 align:middle line:84%
In this example we see
two angels lifting Christ

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.670 align:middle line:90%
into the heavens.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:84%
He ascends into the heavens and
then is shown on his throne.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.350 align:middle line:84%
This once again is a
winged throne telling us

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that this is the
Merkabah throne.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:84%
This illumination from a sixth
century Syrian manuscript

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:84%
called the Rabula Gospels
shows the ascension of Jesus

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:84%
upon a chariot exactly
like the one Ezekiel saw.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:84%
As art historians note, a great
many Western ascension images

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:84%
adopt the pattern
seen in this image.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:84%
This became the common way
of portraying this event.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.880 align:middle line:84%
We see the flying
and wheeled vehicle

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.140 align:middle line:84%
or craft that is the vehicle
of ascension that Christ rides

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:90%
into the stars.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.480 align:middle line:84%
We also note that he is
in fact in a rainbow ring,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.590 align:middle line:84%
again, because he has achieved
the rainbow body or the glory

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:56.410 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But this is exactly
what Ezekiel saw

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.030 align:middle line:84%
when he saw Yahweh
on his throne.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:84%
In this example
from Macedonia we

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:08.450 align:middle line:84%
see Christ ascending on
his winged throne amidst

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.030 align:middle line:90%
a portal or a gateway.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Again this is suggestive of the
tube of light of the Cathars.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:84%
In this example
Christ once again

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.380 align:middle line:90%
is on his red-winged throne.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:84%
It is his flying throne
vehicle, the Merkabah.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.470 align:middle line:84%
This Russian example portrays
exactly the same concept,

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:84%
where he is on the winged
throne in this radiant gate

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:90%
or portal of light.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:84%
In this example Christ sits
on the rainbow ark or bridge

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:90%
that is his throne vehicle.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Christ
on his winged throne

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:90%
actually in a rainbow ring.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:84%
We see that he wears a
cloak covered with stars.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Above him is an empty throne
called the Prepared Throne

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:59.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Second Coming, which
we'll discuss momentarily.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.010 align:middle line:10%
It is clear to us now that
Ezekiel's throne and the throne

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:10%
that Christ rides upon
are the same thing.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:12.900 align:middle line:10%
It's a light body vehicle
that manifests from within us.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.550 align:middle line:10%
Today we visualize
creating flying vehicles.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.510 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, the Volkswagen
company went to China

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and asked the people
there to design

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.480 align:middle line:84%
the new people's
car, or Volkswagen.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The winning contestant
came up with an idea

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of a levitating car, a
circular vehicle that

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:33.270 align:middle line:84%
would ride upon
magnetic strips that

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.610 align:middle line:90%
actually recharge the vehicle.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It appears that the idea of
the levitating or flying ring

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.140 align:middle line:84%
has been in the
human imagination

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.070 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And we appear to be on the
verge of recreating it.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But we must go back again
to the ancient images

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:84%
of the original conception
of the Merkabah throne.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.940 align:middle line:84%
As shown here in this
Armenian version,

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Christ again is on his Merkabah
throne, the complete Ark

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:90%
throne, in the portal.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist and
Mary are on either side,

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.775 align:middle line:84%
taking the place of
the two seraphim.

00:45:07.775 --> 00:45:10.430 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Here Christ is on
the Ark throne,

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.910 align:middle line:90%
his feet on the footstool.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.250 align:middle line:84%
He's in the tube of light
that's filled with stars

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and is composed of
concentric rings.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:84%
He's in what is unmistakably
to modernize a stargate

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:26.480 align:middle line:90%
or in fact a wormhole.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:84%
This appears once again to
be the same tube of light

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that Hieronymus Bosch
portrayed in his painting

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and also the tube of
light that emanates

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:90%
from the Ark of the Covenant.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:41.140 align:middle line:84%
In later ascension images the
rising Christ is shown face-on.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We see the living beings
surrounding the throne

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.640 align:middle line:84%
are present, but the
throne is now gone.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Instead of Ezekiel's
winged chariot,

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:55.070 align:middle line:84%
now the rising Jesus rises
upon a transparent ark or bow

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:58.490 align:middle line:84%
in a portal or gateway
composed of concentric rings.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.360 align:middle line:84%
The tube is filled
with stars again.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, he is in
the beam of light or conduit

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.000 align:middle line:84%
opened by the Ark
of the Covenant

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.890 align:middle line:90%
and is traveling through it.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to fill in the blank
that the transparent ark or bow

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.700 align:middle line:84%
actually represents the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.810 align:middle line:84%
In Perugino's 14th century
"Ascension," all traces

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.460 align:middle line:84%
of Merkabah mysticism
or the Merkabah throne

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.620 align:middle line:90%
disappear from Christian art.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.150 align:middle line:84%
He keeps the gate of light
but omits the winged chariot

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.260 align:middle line:90%
or craft.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And he adds Saint Paul.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.250 align:middle line:84%
In the detail we see that he is
in the almond-shaped mandorla

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.920 align:middle line:84%
or gateway that is
framed by rainbow light,

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.990 align:middle line:84%
hinting once again
the rainbow body.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.290 align:middle line:84%
In Renaissance and
Baroque images,

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Christ ascends through
clouds under his own power

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than being borne by
angels or Ezekiel's chariot.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It's possible this reflects
the golden legend's firm

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:01.840 align:middle line:90%
insistence on self-portation.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we see Christ
riding in the rainbow ring

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:84%
we know that he's actually
manifested the rainbow body

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:13.050 align:middle line:84%
or glory body and is ascending
through the stars as a light

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.752 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:47:14.752 --> 00:47:17.122 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:17.122 --> 00:47:22.710 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd like to talk with you
now about Russian last judgment

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.800 align:middle line:84%
images that portray the Throne
of the Second Coming, the Ark

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.256 align:middle line:90%
throne.

00:47:31.256 --> 00:47:33.800 align:middle line:84%
At the end of my book
"The Secret of Sion"

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I came upon some rather unusual
Russian last judgment images.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.030 align:middle line:84%
In the book I had described
how the earthly Sion

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and the heavenly
Sion are connected.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an earthly
Ark and a heavenly Ark

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.020 align:middle line:84%
it suggested to me
the possibility that

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.920 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant,
the complete Ark, that is,

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.140 align:middle line:84%
functions as a sort
of a docking station.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.110 align:middle line:10%
If we are thinking
of Christ and others

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:04.840 align:middle line:10%
who utilize the Ark of the
Covenant as fast-moving,

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.610 align:middle line:10%
higher vibrational
light beings, then it's

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:11.550 align:middle line:10%
possible that when they manifest
in the lower density, lower

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.170 align:middle line:10%
vibration earth
realm that they need

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:18.140 align:middle line:10%
some form of an anchor point
or perhaps a docking station,

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.960 align:middle line:10%
if you will, in order to
manifest in this realm.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.450 align:middle line:10%
And this is what I propose
the last judgment device is.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It is that docking
station or portal

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:32.420 align:middle line:84%
for transportation for these
beings coming and going

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.490 align:middle line:84%
from the earthly to
the heavenly Sion.

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Here we see a 14th century
Russian last judgment image.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.350 align:middle line:84%
In the top zone we
see Christ enthroned.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Linking the throne of
Christ with the Earth realm

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:50.000 align:middle line:84%
is a serpent that is winding
its way up a central axis.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.550 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the
details here we

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:55.170 align:middle line:84%
see a group of saints that are
entering a pair of golden doors

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.760 align:middle line:84%
that are guarded by
a red-winged seraph.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Beside them is the
serpent making its way up

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.200 align:middle line:90%
to Christ's thrones.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Christ is shown in a radiant
gateway filled with light,

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.940 align:middle line:90%
standing on a blue orb.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Beneath him is a
device, a symbol.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It is the cross
attached to a red alter

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.620 align:middle line:84%
or box that is
guarded by two angels.

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:21.050 align:middle line:84%
This device is called
the Hetoimasia,

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:23.710 align:middle line:84%
or the Throne of
the Second Coming.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It is called the
Prepared Throne,

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and Christ keeps it
close because it's his.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.700 align:middle line:84%
In Christian end time art that
portrays the Second Coming,

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.520 align:middle line:84%
the Hetoimasia is
most often composed

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of a cross, which is viewed as
an instrument of transmutation

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:84%
converting flesh or mass into
light, spirit, or energy;

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:46.940 align:middle line:84%
a spear, the spear
of destiny that

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.650 align:middle line:84%
pierced the side of
Christ; a sponge that

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:53.720 align:middle line:84%
quenched Christ's
thirst; a scroll or book;

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.370 align:middle line:84%
a robe of light; a jar
containing sacred oil;

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and additionally,
a platform that

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:03.480 align:middle line:84%
is in fact the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.400 align:middle line:84%
What I have just
described in fact

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is not only the Throne
of the Second Coming,

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.310 align:middle line:84%
but the complete
Ark of the Covenant.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.250 align:middle line:84%
In this comparison
we once again see

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Tissot's version of
the Ark of the Covenant

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and can see that in fact
the Ark of the Covenant

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.270 align:middle line:84%
is the platform for the
Throne of the Second Coming.

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.930 align:middle line:90%
It is the Ark Throne.

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is the complete
judgment day device.

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Is in fact this device some
form of docking station?

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Christian art seems
to suggest that.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Because once again
it fulfills all

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.590 align:middle line:84%
of the symbolism of the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We see the Ark flanked
by the two angels,

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.420 align:middle line:84%
but now we have the
robe of light attached.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.640 align:middle line:84%
The cross is attached,
the jar of sacred oil,

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.570 align:middle line:90%
and also the open book.

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in this
artwork we see the crown

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.450 align:middle line:84%
of thorns as also attached,
as well as other tools

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:57.450 align:middle line:90%
and implements.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The star-spangled cloak that we
see attached to the Hetoimasia

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:05.440 align:middle line:84%
is in fact the Shroud
of Turin, the light body

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.740 align:middle line:90%
garment of Christ.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:10.600 align:middle line:84%
In 2011 Italian scientists
were able to prove

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.030 align:middle line:84%
that the image on
the Shroud of Turin

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.090 align:middle line:84%
was created by a sudden
burst of light that emanated

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:20.960 align:middle line:84%
from within the body of the
figure covered by that shroud.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
shroud of Turin

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:26.460 align:middle line:84%
is an actual relic of Christ's
manifestation of the glory

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.790 align:middle line:84%
body, the light body,
or the rainbow body.

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Here's a few more
examples of the Hetoimasia

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.305 align:middle line:84%
or the complete Ark of the
Covenant, the judgment day

00:51:35.305 --> 00:51:36.520 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.580 align:middle line:90%
This example is from Moldavia.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:41.670 align:middle line:84%
We see the two angels on
either side of the arc,

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.725 align:middle line:84%
again with the footstool,
with the cross attached to it,

00:51:44.725 --> 00:51:47.170 align:middle line:84%
the crown of thorns,
the spear of destiny,

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:51.270 align:middle line:84%
the rod with the sponge, the
book, and the garment of light.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the complete
device or docking station.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:57.590 align:middle line:84%
There's one of these
on Earth, located

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.580 align:middle line:84%
in the temple of Solomon,
and one in heaven.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And when beings come and
go from the two locations,

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.150 align:middle line:84%
we are told, they
utilize this device.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Another example
featuring Mary and John

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:13.060 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist in the place of
the two angels on either side.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.510 align:middle line:84%
But we have the same Ark
of the Covenant as the base

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:19.200 align:middle line:84%
or platform; the dove, now
symbolic of the Holy Spirit;

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.050 align:middle line:90%
the book; the cross attached.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:26.090 align:middle line:84%
This next example is from
Russia, from the 16th century.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We see Christ above
the Hetoimasia,

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.140 align:middle line:84%
sitting on his Ark throne
with transparent wheels.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And beneath him
is the Hetoimasia.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a very key,
example because as

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:84%
in the example of
Tissot's ark once again,

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
is portrayed as feathered.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.410 align:middle line:84%
When feathers are shown
on the Ark of the Covenant

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:52.460 align:middle line:84%
it indicates that it is in
fact in ascension vehicle.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little deeper
look at the serpent symbolism

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.910 align:middle line:84%
in these Russian
last judgment images.

00:52:56.910 --> 00:53:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Because once again
it affirms my theory

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that the complete Ark of the
Covenant, the judgment day

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.790 align:middle line:84%
device, is in fact a device that
opens a stargate or a wormhole.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Part of my inspiration for
interpreting this symbolism

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.230 align:middle line:90%
comes from Maya symbolism.

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:18.120 align:middle line:10%
Here we are seeing a comparison
between the Russian last

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.630 align:middle line:10%
judgment images and
a Mayan depiction

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:24.050 align:middle line:10%
of the birth of Quetzalcoatl,
the Mayan Savior,

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:27.070 align:middle line:10%
from his celestial
or star place.

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
Quetzalcoatl's name

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:32.070 align:middle line:84%
means "the feathered
serpent," which is exactly

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.320 align:middle line:84%
the definition of the
Hebrew word seraph,

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.360 align:middle line:84%
indicating that in
fact Quetzalcoatl

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.250 align:middle line:90%
could be one of the seraphim.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:43.190 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the image we
see an eight-spoked wheel,

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.950 align:middle line:84%
which Mayan symbolists
tell us represents

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:48.300 align:middle line:84%
the center of the
Milky Way galaxy.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the center of the
galaxy opening, a serpent rope

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:56.070 align:middle line:84%
or umbilical cord emanating
from the center of the galaxy.

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And riding upon it
is Quetzalcoatl.

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, what my friend and
colleague John Major Jenkins

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.550 align:middle line:90%
did is quite interesting.

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:05.790 align:middle line:10%
He said that we can take out
the archaic Mayan term "serpent

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:08.710 align:middle line:10%
rope" and put in the
modern term "wormhole"

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.930 align:middle line:10%
and we have an accurate
depiction or representation

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:13.740 align:middle line:10%
of what the Mayans
say is going to happen

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.100 align:middle line:10%
at the birth of Quetzalcoatl.

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Another example of a
serpent rope or umbilical

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:23.605 align:middle line:84%
cord linking Earth with
the celestial or star place

00:54:23.605 --> 00:54:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is featured here
in this painting

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.750 align:middle line:84%
by the Japanese
painter Kano Hogai.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It features the
goddess Quan Yin,

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.020 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of love
and compassion,

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:36.010 align:middle line:84%
who holds a rod or a wand in
her hand with a string attached.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Attached to the
string is a golden orb

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.840 align:middle line:84%
with a baby's soul
in the golden orb.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.890 align:middle line:84%
An umbilical cord
wraps around the baby.

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And it descends into
a craggy rocky area

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that Kano Hogai
tells us is Earth.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.300 align:middle line:84%
This is clearly
what we're seeing

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.040 align:middle line:84%
in this Russian last judgment
image, is this notion

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.520 align:middle line:84%
that there is an umbilical
cord, a cosmic transportation

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.670 align:middle line:84%
system, that links Earth
with the center of the galaxy

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:04.850 align:middle line:90%
or some other source location.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's what we're
seeing in this imagery here,

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:12.130 align:middle line:84%
is a Russian representation
this cosmic umbilical cord.

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And as this umbilical
cord ascends up

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.880 align:middle line:84%
through these various
levels, it is actually

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.460 align:middle line:84%
depicting a
transportation system

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.010 align:middle line:84%
taking us through various
levels of frequency or density

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.010 align:middle line:84%
or even into other
regions of the galaxy.

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:30.100 align:middle line:84%
As we follow the path of this
serpent rope or umbilical cord,

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.850 align:middle line:84%
we see that it wraps around
the Throne of the Second Coming

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately makes its way
through the throne of Christ,

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:40.850 align:middle line:84%
up to a ring composed
of eight circles,

00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:44.010 align:middle line:84%
in the center of which
we see God the Father.

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.730 align:middle line:10%
This ring with
the eight circles,

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:48.080 align:middle line:10%
the eight-spoked
wheel, is virtually

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.150 align:middle line:10%
identical to the Maya symbol
of the center of the Milky Way

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:53.680 align:middle line:10%
galaxy.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.980 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that the
Russian last judgment imagery

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:00.510 align:middle line:10%
is telling us that there is an
umbilical cord linking earth

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:03.030 align:middle line:10%
with the center of
the Milky Way galaxy?

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:06.170 align:middle line:10%
Is in fact the galactic
center the location

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.640 align:middle line:10%
of Christ's throne?

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.890 align:middle line:10%
This umbilical cord, of course,
reminds us of Jacob's Ladder.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:16.220 align:middle line:10%
He laid his head on the stone
and saw this stairway to heaven

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.120 align:middle line:10%
snaking its way from Earth up to
the throne of the Israelite God

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:10%
El.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Is this a journey to
the galactic center?

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Is Jacob's story possibly
the origin of this imagery

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.990 align:middle line:84%
or does it come
from somewhere else?

00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:34.280 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at this
incredible Tibetan thangka

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.940 align:middle line:10%
that portrays the journey
of the soul rising

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.660 align:middle line:10%
its way up a
serpentine pathway all

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.560 align:middle line:10%
the way to the throne of Buddha.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.950 align:middle line:10%
At the base of the painting
we see that there is a grey

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:10%
elephant making its
way up this path.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.140 align:middle line:84%
It passes through
trials and tribulations,

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.060 align:middle line:84%
represented by fire
and by challengers.

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.660 align:middle line:84%
As the gray elephant
makes its way up the path

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.420 align:middle line:84%
it suddenly starts becoming
half gray and half pink,

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.500 align:middle line:84%
until it makes its way
all the way up to the top

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.180 align:middle line:84%
of the path, where it's
now completely pink.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And there is in fact
a rainbow bridge

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:09.641 align:middle line:84%
that links this pathway
with the throne of Buddha.

00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the Tibetan
and the Russian images

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.420 align:middle line:84%
are telling exactly
the same story.

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:18.710 align:middle line:84%
There is an umbilical
cord, a pathway, maybe

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:22.400 align:middle line:84%
even a wormhole that links earth
with the center of the Milky

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Way galaxy.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.170 align:middle line:10%
In order to access
this gateway we

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:29.340 align:middle line:10%
must go through this
process of purification,

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.580 align:middle line:10%
of cleansing ourselves,
of opening our hearts

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:36.790 align:middle line:10%
and becoming beings of light
in order to make this journey.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.827 align:middle line:84%
Some additional Russian
last judgment images

00:57:38.827 --> 00:57:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that are worth taking a look
at, especially because they

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:45.270 align:middle line:84%
focus on the throne of the
Second Coming, the Hetoimasia.

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:47.890 align:middle line:10%
In this example here
we see the Hetoimasia

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.950 align:middle line:10%
is flanked once again by angels.

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:52.970 align:middle line:10%
Christ sits above it
on his Ark throne,

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:56.980 align:middle line:10%
his feet on the footstool.

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Another example.

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.440 align:middle line:84%
We see the umbilical
cord, the serpent roper

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.750 align:middle line:84%
wormhole winding its way
up past the Hetoimasia,

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:06.800 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the throne.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the complete
throne of the Second Coming.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.850 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant
is the platform,

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:14.330 align:middle line:84%
the robe laid upon the Ark
with the open book on top

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:17.340 align:middle line:90%
and the cross attached.

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:21.230 align:middle line:84%
This ark makes clear that one
complete throne of the Second

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Coming is located at
the throne of Christ.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Is there one on earth?

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a quick
look at the development

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:33.050 align:middle line:84%
of the cross as a symbol and see
how these missing pieces start

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.580 align:middle line:90%
to fall into place.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the earliest
representations

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.600 align:middle line:84%
of the crucifixion is
from the fourth century.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's in the British
Museum in London.

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We see a very simple scene with
Christ attached to the cross.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There are no other
implements in this scene.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Christ carries the
cross to the crucifixion

00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.780 align:middle line:84%
in this scene from
the same period,

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.860 align:middle line:84%
but we note that there's an
addition of a footstool nearby.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Is this a possible hint
that someone at this time

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.720 align:middle line:84%
knew that the cross
was to be placed

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.200 align:middle line:84%
on the Ark of the
Covenant or the footstool?

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.370 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth century,
Pope Gregory the Great

00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:16.210 align:middle line:84%
had a vision in which he saw
Christ manifest before him,

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:19.700 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by various tools
and implements that became known

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:24.380 align:middle line:84%
as the Arma Christi, or the
instruments of the passion.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.740 align:middle line:84%
In this image, we see
Christ manifesting

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:31.010 align:middle line:84%
before Pope Gregory in a
gateway filled with light.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:33.890 align:middle line:84%
He is surrounded by
the Veil of Veronica,

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.410 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Grail, the
crown of thorns,

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.560 align:middle line:84%
the dice that were used
by the Roman soldiers

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.040 align:middle line:90%
to gamble for his robe of light.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And this inaugurates
a time period

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.450 align:middle line:84%
in which we start to see these
various tools and implements,

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:50.080 align:middle line:84%
the Arma Christi,
present in Christian art.

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.190 align:middle line:84%
All of these tools
and implements

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:55.400 align:middle line:84%
were thought to have been
assembled at the crucifixion

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and utilized to help Christ
manifest his resurrection body.

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.340 align:middle line:84%
After the crucifixion
all of these tools

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.810 align:middle line:90%
disappear into myth and legend.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And by the sixth
century, efforts

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:10.060 align:middle line:84%
were being made to
reclaim these items.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:13.360 align:middle line:84%
In these examples we
see the complete kit

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.590 align:middle line:84%
of tools of the crucifixion,
the Arma Christi,

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
or in fact the throne
of the Second Coming.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
We see Christ
emanating or rising

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:27.440 align:middle line:84%
from a tomb that could well
be the Ark of the Covenant.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We see the cross attached
to the Ark of the Covenant.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
That is the Hetoimasia or the
throne of the Second Coming.

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
In my view, each
of these images is

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
portraying the complete
throne of Christ,

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
the throne of the Second
Coming, or the Hetoimasia,

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
with the cross attached

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and the various tools
or implements that

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
are assembled that ultimately
manifest the resurrection

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:56.060 align:middle line:90%
body or the light body.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
This example here is key,
because it includes the INRI

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
placard.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.150 align:middle line:84%
This was placed atop the
cross by Pontius Pilate

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and is supposed to identify
Christ as the King of the Jews

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.460 align:middle line:90%
and also to state his crime.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.890 align:middle line:84%
In the esoteric
tradition, however, INRI

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
stands for by fire,
frequency, or vibration,

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
humankind is renewed
or made whole.

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And it indicates that
this complete device

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:25.500 align:middle line:84%
is a tool that harnesses a fire,
frequency, or vibration that

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.610 align:middle line:90%
transforms us.

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
This fresco is a
favorite example.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
It's by an anonymous
painter in Italy.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.395 align:middle line:84%
At the base we see
three priests who

01:01:34.395 --> 01:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
have assembled the
complete kit or Hetoimasia.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And above it is
Christ manifesting

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
through an almond-shaped
mandorla or gateway composed

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
of rainbow colored light.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
In the gateway he
sits upon his throne,

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.570 align:middle line:84%
indicating that what
we're looking at here

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, the complete ark
throne of the Second Coming.

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Here in this example
from San Marco in Venice

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.790 align:middle line:84%
we see a ring of apostles
who are sitting on benches,

01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:04.490 align:middle line:90%
or perhaps thrones of their own.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.690 align:middle line:84%
They are linked through
their consciousness

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
to the throne of the
Second Coming, which

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
is located in some other
realm, indicating that there

01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:16.180 align:middle line:84%
is a consciousness link that
is being made to that throne.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It suggests to me that these
apostles know the secret

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that the throne, in fact, emits
a frequency or vibration that

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.000 align:middle line:90%
transforms our consciousness.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
In this incredible example
from the 15th century,

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
we see that Christ has all of
the symbols of the Hetoimasia

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
or the Arma Christi, the
instruments of the passion,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.660 align:middle line:90%
on his body.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a tip for us
to embody these tools.

01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant is within us.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So is the cross or
the tree of life.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.990 align:middle line:90%
So is the crown of thorns.

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And our objective is to learn
to embody this consciousness

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.510 align:middle line:90%
and to become the throne itself.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
We see the same thing here, in
this example from the Brooklyn

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Museum by an anonymous painter
from Spain in the 14th century.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
We see that Christ wears all
of the tools or implements

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
of the passion,
the Arma Christi.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
What we are to
deduce from this is

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that he spent his life
mastering this symbolism,

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
learning to utilize
all of these tools

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and implements to achieve the
resurrection body or light

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.530 align:middle line:90%
body.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:22.710 align:middle line:84%
For when the Arma Christi,
this kit of tools,

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
is fully assembled within us,
it manifests the resurrection

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
body.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
This is why Jan van
Eyck's depiction

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of the crucifixion of
Jesus is so important.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
It shows John the
Baptist and Mary

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
on either side as
the two angels.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Christ is sitting
on the ark throne

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.280 align:middle line:90%
with the cross behind him.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And he has fully manifested
the rainbow body.

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:48.370 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:54.630 align:middle line:90%


01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:57.700 align:middle line:10%
>>So why the symbols?

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.570 align:middle line:10%
The answer comes from Buddhism.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.940 align:middle line:10%
The first Buddhist artist
showed the Buddha aniconically,

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.130 align:middle line:10%
meaning he wasn't
shown as a person,

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:09.510 align:middle line:10%
but represented by symbols.

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Common symbols were a
wheel, a set of footprints,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.020 align:middle line:84%
an umbrella, a
throne, and a tree.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The tree that is
shown here is the tree

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
at Bodh Gaya where Bhudda
reached enlightenment,

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
the Bodhi Tree.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
At this pilgrimage site a
throne was later created.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And this throne is often shown
on pictures that otherwise

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
seem meant to show the
moment of enlightenment.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
What is shown is probably not
the moment of enlightenment,

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
but rather the journey
to enlightenment.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is what this
complete kit of symbols

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:45.990 align:middle line:90%
represents in Buddhism.

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
The Bodhi Tree is a symbol
of Buddha's enlightenment.

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a reminder of the
ultimate human potential

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
that lies within all of us.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
"Bodhi" is the Sanskrit
word for "fully awake."

01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.720 align:middle line:10%
Some people see the
Bodhi Tree as an example

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.090 align:middle line:10%
of the world tree, whose
roots are deep in the earth

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:08.370 align:middle line:10%
but whose branches
reach into the heavens.

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:11.880 align:middle line:10%
Here we see the Bodhi Tree
attached to the throne.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.440 align:middle line:90%


01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, these symbols
represent the devotee coming

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
face to face with
the absent Buddha.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
He's not there, because
he's entered nirvana.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
He's transcended the
earthly human condition

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and now exists in
the Dharma realm

01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
in his Dharma body
or light body.

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:34.310 align:middle line:10%
This body cannot be completely
or adequately visualized

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:35.370 align:middle line:10%
by humans.

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:37.520 align:middle line:10%
Therefore it's not portrayed.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.480 align:middle line:10%
And in its place
we see the symbols.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.550 align:middle line:90%


01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, the images of
the blessed throne of Buddha

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:48.190 align:middle line:90%
were used as meditation tools.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Ananda Coomaraswamy
points out that they

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
were made to be used in the
practice of visual formulation.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.920 align:middle line:84%
The artist would meditate
before the created image,

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and their purpose is to be used
as visual aids and meditations

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.910 align:middle line:90%
on the Buddha.

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
In practice, the
meditator concentrates

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
on the object in such a way
that the symbol for the object

01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:10.470 align:middle line:90%
is created in his mind.

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
The meditator can then
reassemble this kit at any time

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
without the need of
the actual object.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Ark
of the Covenant

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
was made after a pattern
given to Moses by God.

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the Ark of the Covenant

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
follows the same pattern as
the Buddhist throne, that

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is that as we meditate
on and visualize

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
the full symbolism of
the Ark of the Covenant

01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:39.650 align:middle line:84%
we are able to create
it in our minds

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:44.000 align:middle line:90%
and in fact in our own bodies?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's compare the image
of the throne of Buddha

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.110 align:middle line:90%
with the throne of Christ.

01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, they are
exactly the same symbol.

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
In its simplest
form we see a throne

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
with a tree attached to it,
as well as other symbols.

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.070 align:middle line:10%
This is clearly the
throne of the fully awake

01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:07.140 align:middle line:10%
of the Buddhist tradition.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.630 align:middle line:10%
What it suggests to me is that,
as in the Buddhist tradition,

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:13.830 align:middle line:10%
if we visualize,
meditate, and focus

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:16.560 align:middle line:10%
on assembling these
symbols within ourselves,

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.040 align:middle line:10%
that we too can reach
that state of fully

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.995 align:middle line:10%
awake or Christ consciousness.

01:07:21.995 --> 01:07:24.550 align:middle line:90%


01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It appears that Christian
artists throughout time

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
knew that our consciousness
had the ability

01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to manifest this device
within ourselves,

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
simply by meditating and
focusing on these symbols.

01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:40.020 align:middle line:10%
In this example here, found
in the British Museum,

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:43.300 align:middle line:10%
we see an assortment of
symbols, the Hetoimasia,

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.210 align:middle line:10%
the throne of the Second Coming.

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
The text that accompanies it
declares that whoever recites

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
the prayer, ave
[? fasis  preclara, ?]

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.120 align:middle line:10%
and looks at the image
with devotion will receive

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.650 align:middle line:10%
an indulgence of three years
and may experience a beatific

01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:02.580 align:middle line:10%
vision of Christ in which the
glory pours upon the meditator.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Think of that.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
By focusing on
meditating on this image

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
it can open our consciousness
so that we receive

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
a download, if you will, of the
glory or vibration of Christ.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly
what the Buddha said

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.800 align:middle line:84%
the images of the throne
of Buddha could do as well.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And if my assessment
is correct, this

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is what happened with the Ark of
the Covenant symbolism as well.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So where did the image
of the Buddhist throne

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.950 align:middle line:90%
come from originally?

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Where did the image of Christ's
throne of the Second Coming

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.479 align:middle line:90%
come from originally?

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:42.189 align:middle line:84%
Where do we find this idea of
a ark or a platform or a throne

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:45.149 align:middle line:84%
with the tree of
life attached to it?

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:49.069 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals that we
find the earliest example

01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
of such a throne at the temple
of Seti I in Abydos, Egypt.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:57.139 align:middle line:84%
Inside we find what is
called the head of Osiris,

01:08:57.139 --> 01:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
an image that was created
at the time of Moses.

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that the head
of Osiris is in fact a device.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
It is a symbol.

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyph for
the head of Osiris

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
features a pillar with a
serpent levitating on it.

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
That pillar is placed on
the shrine symbol that

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
is shown flanked by two
tet or power pillars.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
When fully assembled,
it forms a device

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.899 align:middle line:84%
known as the head of Osiris or
perhaps the throne of Osiris.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
In this comparison
here we can see

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that the platform of
the throne of Osiris

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
is virtually identical to
the Ark of the Covenant,

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
or rather the Ark
of the Covenant

01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
is virtually identical
to the platform

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.340 align:middle line:84%
upon which the head
of Osiris sits.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.310 align:middle line:84%
The head of Osiris
functioned as a symbol,

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
not only of Osiris and
his earthly kingdom,

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
but also of the underworld
realm of the god

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.890 align:middle line:90%
and the hope for the afterlife.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So what we're actually
looking at in this device,

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
this symbol is the
ancient Egyptian symbol

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.310 align:middle line:90%
for the hope for the afterlife.

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Now what's amazing about this
is that the serpent levitating

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
on a pillar or pole
is a symbol that

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
was well-known to Moses
and the Israelites.

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
In the book of
Numbers, Moses was

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:20.256 align:middle line:84%
told to make a fiery serpent
and set it upon a pole.

01:10:20.256 --> 01:10:21.880 align:middle line:84%
"And it came to pass
that everyone that

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
was bitten by this
fiery serpent, when

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:27.200 align:middle line:90%
he looked upon it was healed."

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
The fiery serpent is actually
the Hebrew definition

01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:32.030 align:middle line:90%
of a seraph.

01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:35.530 align:middle line:10%
So in fact what we are looking
at in this episode of Moses

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:38.670 align:middle line:10%
lifting the serpent on a
pole is that he is, in fact,

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:42.030 align:middle line:10%
making or identifying a seraph.

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The serpent on a
pole is the logo

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
for the seraphim, the
highest order of angels

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
who guard the Ark
of the Covenant.

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the
logo of the seraphim

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
is in fact the same
as the head of Osiris.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Based upon this I
propose that what

01:10:59.530 --> 01:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
we are looking at with
the head of Osiris

01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
is in fact the complete
ark throne device.

01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And as this symbolism
dates to around 1450 BC,

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
it is the earliest version
of this ark throne symbolism

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that was later adopted
by the Buddhists

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and adopted by Christianity
as the throne of the Second

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Coming.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So what function did the ark
throne of Osiris perform?

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
The answer is provided
at the temple of Seti

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
at Abydos, where on the opposite
wall that portrays the ark

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:38.200 align:middle line:84%
throne we see that King Seti
has transformed into the pillar.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We see Seti as
the head of Osiris

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.340 align:middle line:90%
attached to the ark throne.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.470 align:middle line:10%
And now the Egyptian
artists have

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:51.450 align:middle line:10%
included the Ark of the Millions
of Years, the ship of eternity.

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:55.600 align:middle line:10%
What this suggests to me, and
is validated by physicists

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.230 align:middle line:10%
and other scholars that I
have consulted about this,

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:02.990 align:middle line:10%
is that we are seeing Seti's
transformation into Osiris.

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:05.690 align:middle line:10%
It's as if the ark
throne of Osiris

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:11.230 align:middle line:10%
is a transformation device
that turns or transforms Seti

01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:13.720 align:middle line:10%
into the God being
and prepares him

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.900 align:middle line:10%
for his journey into the
field or the dimension

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.590 align:middle line:10%
of the blessed.

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Again, the ark of
eternity resembles

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:25.440 align:middle line:84%
in its symbolism, and possibly
its function, a wormhole.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that what we are
looking at here in the ark

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.880 align:middle line:90%
throne is an ascension device?

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's
exactly what we are seeing.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And I would suggest that
this is the earliest

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:41.670 align:middle line:10%
version of the complete
judgment day device.

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:44.550 align:middle line:10%
This is the device that has
been sought for centuries,

01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:49.940 align:middle line:10%
and once fully assembled is
actually a stargate device.

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian symbolism
it's most often

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Isis who operates
this Osiris device.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.810 align:middle line:84%
He or she is shown beside the
Osiris device in a [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that was taken off the walls
of the temple of Seti at Abydos

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and is now found in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:08.090 align:middle line:90%
in New York City.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's compare the image of
Isis tending the Osiris device

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.110 align:middle line:84%
with Mary Magdelene at the foot
of the cross of crucifixion.

01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Atop of this cross,
in this example,

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
we see a tree growing
from the cross,

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
indicating that this in
fact is the tree of life.

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:28.100 align:middle line:84%
In my view, these images
are telling the same story.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
A priestess or a goddess is
operating the complete ark

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
throne tree of life device
that transforms a human

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.100 align:middle line:90%
into a resurrected light being.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
In my view, this is how
the ark throne symbolism

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:48.840 align:middle line:84%
was transposed into
Christian symbolism.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1100s, nine
French Knights Templar

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
left Paris and
went to Jerusalem.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.360 align:middle line:84%
They did years of
excavation beneath the site

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.850 align:middle line:90%
of Solomon's temple.

01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
They came back to France
with some stupendous secret.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
No one's exactly
sure what it was

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Knights
Templar discovered.

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
However, we know the Templar
paid a visit to Abbot Suger

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.010 align:middle line:90%
at St. Denis, near Paris.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:16.560 align:middle line:10%
Abbot Suger is believed to have
taken whatever secret knowledge

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.570 align:middle line:10%
the Templars gave to him
and enfolded that knowledge

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:23.970 align:middle line:10%
or encoded that knowledge
into this window medallion

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:25.680 align:middle line:10%
at St. Denis.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.950 align:middle line:10%
In his own words,
Abbot Suger tells us

01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:32.150 align:middle line:10%
that this is the complete or
true cross of crucifixion.

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:35.030 align:middle line:10%
What we see is the
cross of crucifixion

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:38.730 align:middle line:10%
attached to the Ark
of the Covenant.

01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:43.140 align:middle line:10%
It's obvious to us that
Suger is portraying

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:47.300 align:middle line:10%
the throne of Osiris, the
complete ark throne of Osiris,

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:50.220 align:middle line:10%
and the throne of
the Second Coming,

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.560 align:middle line:10%
opening up the possibility
that what the Knights

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.340 align:middle line:10%
Templar discovered
beneath Solomon's temple

01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:01.390 align:middle line:10%
was in fact the secrets of
the complete cross of Christ.

01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:04.100 align:middle line:84%
This complete cross is
found in other instances

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.650 align:middle line:84%
of Christian art, including
this piece here featuring

01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Mary Magdalene.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
We can decode this
for ourselves now.

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.260 align:middle line:90%
She's sitting on the ark throne.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
She holds the flask
containing the sacred oil,

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.590 align:middle line:90%
the resurrection oil.

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And she holds the tree of
life, the cross of crucifixion,

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.580 align:middle line:90%
on her lap.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:26.480 align:middle line:84%
She is shown with the
complete ark cross.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately my research reveals
that this symbolism is inside

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.020 align:middle line:90%
of us.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to connect
the imagery that we're

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:39.220 align:middle line:84%
seeing in all of these paintings
with psychospiritual attributes

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:41.020 align:middle line:90%
within our own bodies.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, what I've done
here is taken the Osiris device

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and superimposed over
a meditating woman.

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect match.

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And what it suggests is that,
in fact, the Ark of the Covenant

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.130 align:middle line:90%
is within us.

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It's located in our
first three shakras.

01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
The pillar or cross, the
tree that is attached

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
is in fact our
spinal cord system.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
The two tablets on top
of the Osiris device

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:10.210 align:middle line:84%
are in fact the two
hemispheres of our brain.

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Once we fully activate our
mind-brain spiritual system,

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
we are able to transform our
bodies into beings of light,

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.360 align:middle line:84%
ascend on our Merkabah
throne into the heavens,

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even to
phase back and forth

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
between the material and
the immaterial realms.

01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:32.265 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:16:32.265 --> 01:16:39.120 align:middle line:90%


01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.970 align:middle line:10%
>>The connection between the
human body and the Osiris

01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:45.880 align:middle line:10%
device suggests to me that
our body could in fact

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.290 align:middle line:10%
be a sort of an antenna.

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:50.120 align:middle line:10%
Earlier we talked
about the possibility

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.170 align:middle line:10%
that the cross somehow
manifested a higher dimensional

01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:56.530 align:middle line:10%
energy, the INRI, the higher
frequency or vibration

01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:00.400 align:middle line:10%
that makes humanity
whole, holy, or new.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.870 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about this
celestial fire and its role

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:07.260 align:middle line:10%
in the Second Coming
and its connection

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:09.670 align:middle line:10%
with the throne of
the Second Coming.

01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:13.490 align:middle line:10%
This is a scene from a
monastery in Moldavia.

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:17.470 align:middle line:10%
As we look at it, we
see several zones.

01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:22.340 align:middle line:84%
At the very topmost zone is God
the Father in a rainbow ring.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Beneath him is Christ
enthroned on his winged throne.

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And beneath him
is the Hetoimasia,

01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:31.490 align:middle line:90%
the throne of the Second Coming.

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
What we notice is that
emanating from Christ's throne

01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
is a channel of
cosmic energy called

01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:40.550 align:middle line:90%
the River of Divine Fire.

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
That River of Divine Fire is
shown in this example as well.

01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Again we see several zones with
Christ at one of the top zones.

01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:50.800 align:middle line:10%
We see the Hetoimasia
beneath him.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.670 align:middle line:10%
And we see the River of Divine
Fire emanating from the throne

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:58.150 align:middle line:10%
and actually going through the
throne of the Second Coming.

01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:01.360 align:middle line:10%
The same thing is shown
in this example as well.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.190 align:middle line:10%
We see the throne of
the Second Coming.

01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:05.080 align:middle line:10%
We see Christ enthroned above.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And emanating from that
throne is this channel

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic energy, this
River of Divine Fire.

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
In each example the
Hetoimasia, the throne

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Second Coming,
appears to perform

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
an intermediary function.

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.360 align:middle line:90%
It's between Earth and heaven.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is acting as sort of
a transformer, if you will,

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.370 align:middle line:90%
of this vibration.

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Here in this example from
Torcello near Venice, Italy,

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
we see the Hetoimasia, the
throne of the Second Coming,

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.380 align:middle line:90%
beneath the throne of Christ.

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
We see the two angels
on either side tending

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that thrown with Mary and John
the Baptist on either side

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.740 align:middle line:90%
once again.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Christ is on his throne.

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:46.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a wheeled throne.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
The River of Divine Energy
emanates from that throne,

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.460 align:middle line:84%
leaves that throne, and
finally makes its way down

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.210 align:middle line:90%
to the earth plane.

01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
One wonders if this is the same
as the umbilical cord portrayed

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
in the Maya imagery portraying
the birth of Quetzalcoatl

01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:05.210 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
the Milky Way galaxy.

01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Is this early Christian art
possibly portraying a channel

01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
or an umbilical cord
of cosmic energy

01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic center,
making its way to earth?

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
What's incredible about this is
that just a few years ago NASA

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:24.280 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there are,
in fact magnetic portals

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.190 align:middle line:90%
that link Earth with the sun.

01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:30.220 align:middle line:84%
NASA imagery portrays
these magnetic portals,

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
which they also call flux ropes,
connecting Earth with the sun.

01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
When we note the similarity
between the images

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of the River of
Divine Fire emanating

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
from the throne with
images of the sun

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
releasing rivers of
charged particles,

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:50.420 align:middle line:84%
it raises the possibility
that the throne is the sun.

01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the
physics of flux ropes

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.690 align:middle line:90%
is applied across the universe.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, a solar physics
model of flux rope ejection

01:19:59.310 --> 01:20:02.410 align:middle line:84%
was recently used to explain
the jets driven by the accretion

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
discs around the super
massive black holes found

01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:07.180 align:middle line:90%
in the center of galaxies.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Applying this model to
Last Judgment imagery

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the
throne could be the sun.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But jumping scale,
as is allowed,

01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the
throne could in fact

01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
be located at the center
of the Milky Way galaxy.

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Jack Scudder and his
team of researchers

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.780 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Iowa have found

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
what they call X-points in
the earth's magnetosphere,

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field that
is naturally generated

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.920 align:middle line:84%
by the earth and
protects the earth

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%
from these cosmic particles.

01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
NASA satellites have
revealed X portals

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.450 align:middle line:84%
in the magnetosphere, which
Scudder explains are, quote,

01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
"places where the
magnetic field of Earth

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:47.860 align:middle line:84%
connects to the magnetic
field of the sun,

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:51.300 align:middle line:84%
creating an uninterrupted path
leading from our own planet

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.690 align:middle line:90%
to the sun's atmosphere."

01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
What they are
saying is that there

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
is an umbilical
cord linking Earth

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
with the sun through which
highly charged particles flow.

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Scaling this up
one level tells us

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:09.200 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible that
such portals might exist

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
between our sun and
the galactic center.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.590 align:middle line:84%
These openings allow
charged solar particles

01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to be conducted in the
planet's upper atmosphere.

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
The effects of
this phenomenon are

01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
seen as the Aurora displays
and geomagnetic storms.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
As foretold in Revelation
20:12, "At judgment day

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
the dead, great and small, will
stand before God's throne."

01:21:33.650 --> 01:21:37.520 align:middle line:84%
In Daniel 7:9 and we learn
Daniel saw a river of fire

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
or a fiery stream flowing
out from the throne,

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.610 align:middle line:90%
stretching to earth.

01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
The throne he is describing
is the Hetoimasia

01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
or the throne of
the Second Coming.

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.670 align:middle line:84%
"I watched till thrones
were put in place

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and the Ancient of
days was seated.

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
His garment was white as
snow and the hair of his head

01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:57.830 align:middle line:90%
was like pure wool.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
His throne was a fiery flame,
its wheels a burning fire.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
A fiery stream issued and
came forth from behind him."

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
The illustrations of
this River of Divine Fire

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
leave little doubt that
the ancients believed

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
umbilical cord linking

01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Earth with the throne of God.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.400 align:middle line:10%
This fire is the same
as the living waters,

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.310 align:middle line:10%
the waters of
immortality prophesied

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:24.560 align:middle line:10%
to appear in the end time
by the prophet Isaiah who

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.250 align:middle line:10%
said, "The earth shall be full
of the knowledge of the Lord

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.531 align:middle line:10%
as the waters cover the sea."

01:22:29.531 --> 01:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
In 2012 NASA researchers
discovered a channel

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic energy emanating from
the center of the Milky Way

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
galaxy.

01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
A research team of the
Department of Physics,

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Keio University, has discovered
a giant molecular cloud or star

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
nursery located in
the galactic center.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
The team called it a pig
tail because of its shape,

01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:54.070 align:middle line:84%
but it clearly looks
more like a serpent rope

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:56.680 align:middle line:90%
or a channel of cosmic energy.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.230 align:middle line:84%
We see channels of
living water connecting

01:22:59.230 --> 01:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Earth with the heavens in
ancient Egyptian imagery.

01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:07.780 align:middle line:84%
In the top zone we see a figure
riding upon a ship of eternity

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.870 align:middle line:90%
in an ark-like enclosure.

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And we see this channel
of cosmic water emanating

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.790 align:middle line:90%
from that throne.

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:16.220 align:middle line:10%
This is very much
like what we see

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.700 align:middle line:10%
in Spell 110 of the
Egyptian "Book of the Dead,"

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.460 align:middle line:10%
where we see a scene of a soul
rising from the earth plane

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.885 align:middle line:10%
to the celestial
realm, called the field

01:23:24.885 --> 01:23:26.800 align:middle line:10%
or Dimension of the Blessed.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.060 align:middle line:10%
In the lower zone we see
a dual-headed serpent ship

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.520 align:middle line:10%
with a stairway to
heaven attached to it.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the Ark of the Millions
of Years, the boat upon which

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.430 align:middle line:90%
the soul travels for eternity.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
The shape of this
dual-headed serpent ship

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.390 align:middle line:90%
resembles a modern wormhole.

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
With the addition of
the stairway to heaven

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
we once again get the idea
that this an ascension vehicle.

01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:51.140 align:middle line:84%
As the soul rises through
these cosmic waterways

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
it is portrayed doing ordinary
things-- it's tending fields,

01:23:54.450 --> 01:23:57.630 align:middle line:84%
it's harvesting-- until it gets
to the very top zone, where

01:23:57.630 --> 01:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
it is once again riding
aboard the Ark of the Millions

01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
of Years into eternity.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the Egyptian
imagery in this Spell 110

01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Book of the
Dead is interchangeable

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.240 align:middle line:84%
with the Russian last
judgment imagery.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us or
affirming this idea

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that there is an umbilical cord,
a channel of cosmic energy,

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that links earth with the
celestial realms, the realm

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.690 align:middle line:90%
of eternity.

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:24.320 align:middle line:10%
When I give presentations about
the throne of the Second Coming

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.880 align:middle line:10%
people always ask me,
well, what does the Vatican

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.010 align:middle line:10%
know about this?

01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:29.830 align:middle line:10%
Well let me show you.

01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:33.320 align:middle line:10%
These murals are from the
Redemptoris Mater Chapel,

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.640 align:middle line:10%
which is located just
outside the doors

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.400 align:middle line:10%
of the papal apartment
in the Vatican.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.590 align:middle line:90%
We clearly see our throne.

01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
We see the complete
Hetoimasia device.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And we see Christ manifesting
through an open portal

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.780 align:middle line:90%
or gateway.

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
The message of this imagery
is clear-- the throne

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Second Coming
is a stargate.

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And here we see
Christ manifesting

01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:57.570 align:middle line:84%
through that open
portal or gateway

01:24:57.570 --> 01:25:02.300 align:middle line:84%
at the other end of a river
or channel of cosmic energy.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
What all of this means to me
is that the ancients clearly

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:07.990 align:middle line:84%
knew of an advanced
device that was

01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
capable of opening
portals or gateways.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.220 align:middle line:90%
That device is within us.

01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.700 align:middle line:90%
That's for certain.

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
What is also possible
is that there

01:25:16.890 --> 01:25:21.010 align:middle line:84%
is an actual literal
physical device out here that

01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
acts as a sort of docking
station for these beings.

01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
In the coming
years we will begin

01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:32.210 align:middle line:84%
to see more and more scientific
validation of this idea,

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
this concept of
the transformation

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.220 align:middle line:84%
of the human being
into a body of light,

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and the existence of
these portals or gateways.

01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:41.860 align:middle line:10%
What we must be aware of in
these next few years as well

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:45.550 align:middle line:10%
is that there are religious and
political figures on the planet

01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:51.080 align:middle line:10%
today who seek to utilize this
knowledge for their benefit.

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:56.120 align:middle line:10%
If Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is
successful in his cosmic quest,

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.720 align:middle line:10%
he will open the way
towards the appearance

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.730 align:middle line:10%
of the Islamic
Messiah, the Mahdi.

01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:05.380 align:middle line:10%
As we noted, that figure will
be delivering or revealing

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.410 align:middle line:10%
the Ark of the
Covenant to Earth.

01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:10.160 align:middle line:10%
He will be assisted by Jesus.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.550 align:middle line:10%
My reason for doing this work
is because my concern would

01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:16.480 align:middle line:10%
be that if these figures show
up with a simple golden box

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.760 align:middle line:10%
and tell us that that is
the Ark of the Covenant

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.816 align:middle line:10%
that this figure
is symbolized by,

01:26:20.816 --> 01:26:22.440 align:middle line:10%
then we probably know
we're not dealing

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.126 align:middle line:10%
with a legitimate figure.

01:26:24.126 --> 01:26:26.000 align:middle line:10%
Because I believe that
the body of evidence I

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.600 align:middle line:10%
have shown you in
this program reveals

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.390 align:middle line:10%
that the true Ark
of the Covenant

01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:34.650 align:middle line:10%
is in fact a complete ark
throne device and ascension

01:26:34.650 --> 01:26:38.240 align:middle line:10%
vehicle that is utilized by
these beings, who will teach us

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.660 align:middle line:10%
how to transform ourselves
into these higher beings.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.710 align:middle line:90%
