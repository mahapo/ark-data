that it's not very good
for Western students

to try to encourage them through
a path that has so much form.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.340 align:middle line:84%

their lives are already

more space as a culture.

filled with form.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So give them more form doesn't
really seem to work that well.

do a practice now

And when you live in
your body in that way,

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.760 align:middle line:84%
it's so much more compelling

a different experience

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:39.290 align:middle line:10%
as a Western woman, and
that I needed to honor that.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I had to make my own
decisions and my own mistakes

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and see what happened, at

they don't want to go
into the corporate world,

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:03.090 align:middle line:10%

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But I always struggle
with these questions

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.510 align:middle line:84%
because I have such a

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:09.420 align:middle line:90%

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:51.900 align:middle line:10%
My love of Buddhism was one
of first memories that I have.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.507 align:middle line:90%


00:53:55.507 --> 00:53:59.220 align:middle line:10%
I believed for a
long time, to be

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.520 align:middle line:10%
spiritual was to be very
serious and to not enjoy life.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had lots of those concepts
and ideas that I had to drop.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the way
I'm teaching, I let

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.190 align:middle line:90%
go of a lot of beautiful forms.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It requires tremendous sense
of if our activities to have

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:27.900 align:middle line:90%
lots of images, big ultra.

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm quite lazy, and also,
in some sense, a minimalist.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not me delivering
another lecture.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.940 align:middle line:90%
This is about going inside.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Open our heart and be
honest to ourselves.

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions
that we might like to ask

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:54.620 align:middle line:90%
is why am I not free right now?

00:54:54.620 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:90%


00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So I let go of lots of forms
and focusing more the heart

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:08.930 align:middle line:84%
of Buddhist teachings,
which is very profound,

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:09.950 align:middle line:90%
yet it is simple.
