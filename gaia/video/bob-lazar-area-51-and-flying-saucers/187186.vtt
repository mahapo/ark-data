are the questions

since the beginning.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
We're no closer to
answering any of them.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:10%
But Bob got pretty close.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Bob got to read these
briefing documents that

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:90%
provided those kind of answers.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, when we
were covering his story,

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
so much of the effort was
in proving that he really

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:90%
was the person he said he was.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:10%
Is it true or is it
plausible that really that

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:10%
was the focus more than
the really important stuff.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.213 align:middle line:84%
You have to cover the
story of Bob Lazar.

00:12:06.213 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to do
that is to talk to Bob.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
he'll talk to you or not,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:90%
but you need to try,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to be
circumstance for you,

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
is the moment that
you approach him,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
the mood that he's in, what
else is going on in his life

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You might hit the
jackpot and get him

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.440 align:middle line:84%
at exactly the right time
and the universe is aligned

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and he's willing
to talk about it.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But you'd have to
be awfully lucky.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Because in general, Bob
doesn't like to talk about it.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I think he's very
happy in his life.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
He's happy to have left
the UFO stuff behind.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:90%
He misses his his friends.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:90%
He misses John Lear.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
He misses Gene Huff, maybe
even me to some extent.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't
miss the UFO topic.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't miss
talking about it

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately,
it's disturbing.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:90%
These are disturbing issues.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:84%

are as people, as human beings,

Big questions,
disturbing answers.

comfortable in talking

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:90%
about them, never.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
He reacted by going into
a cocoon in a lot of ways.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
He didn't like-- he doesn't
like the attention because it

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:90%
totally screwed up his life.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not surprising
that even years later,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:84%
he still is uncomfortable
in discussing these things.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.794 align:middle line:84%
It's a very disturbing
view of reality.

I was completely shocked.

I couldn't-- I
couldn't believe it.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:90%
But I was fascinated.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:90%
I was so excited.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I-- it's a science
dream, really.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I was shown them,
one close-up, one operating.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
They had one of the reactors
out of the crafts, which

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:90%
was an antimatter reactor.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I was given a demonstration
on how it worked,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.137 align:middle line:84%
things that it did,
and the physics of it.

00:18:33.137 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
The thing they were
most interested in

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:41.417 align:middle line:84%
is duplicating the reactors
without using this element 115,

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:90%
which is, of course, impossible.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to--

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:84%

before that just trying

with plutonium.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
a futile attempt.

it spread everywhere.

>> Yeah.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:84%

interview in May of 1989,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:90%
with him as Dennis.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:10%

not known, not revealed
to the audience.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And even that, before we
know who Bob Lazar was,

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:90%
that sparked a big--

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of interest
among the public.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I spent, like, eight months
between May and November

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%

background to see if we could

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.493 align:middle line:84%
solidify the case, to
see if we could find out

00:20:32.493 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:90%
if he was telling the truth.

unleash it in November,

00:20:37.015 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
which is what we did.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:10%
It was the highest rated
news series we've ever done.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:10%

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:10%
that ever aired in Las Vegas.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:10%

You had media interest
from all over the world.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of it was
skeptical at the beginning,

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:90%
which of course it would be.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, every major
news organization in the world

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:90%
beat a path to Area 51's door.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%

started showing up out there

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%

flying around in the desert.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:10%

but they've all covered
it, all of them.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%

worked at S4, Area 51

is the term that
the public knows.

that can happen to us?

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:84%

me the reactor in operation,

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:51.750 align:middle line:90%
here it is on the bench.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact same feeling,
but it was no metal involved.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's shocking.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:84%
That's really shocking
because nothing does that.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.000 align:middle line:84%
That's an operating,
powerful force field.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So just seeing
something like that,

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
it immediately starts
that whole chain reaction

in your mind going, well, wait.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:84%

rocket engines anymore.

that machine worked that I

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.220 align:middle line:90%
was sitting there touching.

part of human history

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:90%
that we've found that out.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:10%

fearsome at the same time.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It was being completely
fucking scared all day long.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly the most
fun job when you're there.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:13.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, almost three decades
later the fear drops off

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're just left with
the amazement and technology

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.480 align:middle line:90%

00:33:24.705 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:90%
We're all looking for an answer.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Having physical proof
is an awful big deal.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what a lot of people
find really compelling about

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Bob-- he legitimately appeared,
and appears sometimes,

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:90%
just perplexed by what he saw.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed that
kind of about him?

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:84%
He was aware that
this was weird.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.060 align:middle line:84%
He was aware it was weird
that they hired him.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
he's a smart guy

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and he thinks outside the box.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So in a lot of ways, he
might have been just what,

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:84%
exactly what they
needed a program that

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be stalled.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that he wasn't their
kind of a guy, that they could

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:84%
have had their pick of any
scientists in the world,

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:90%
presumably, to work on this.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:90%
So it was strange.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.469 align:middle line:84%
And it was strange that
they started showing him

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:84%
these breeding blocks with
this incredibly sensitive

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.465 align:middle line:90%
information right off the bat.

00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Soon as he gets there,
they start showing him

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:84%
this stuff with alien
bodies broken down

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:84%
so you can see their
organs, the history

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:84%
of human-alien interaction,
and all kinds of things

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that the UFO community
had suspected

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:90%
but no one could prove.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And he just thought it
was weird that anyone

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.100 align:middle line:90%
would show him this stuff.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.230 align:middle line:84%
He wondered what the
heck was going on.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:90%
I think he was thrilled.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.447 align:middle line:84%
You know, part of him was
really thrilled to be there

00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and thrilled to see it,
even if it turned out

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.510 align:middle line:90%
to be some kind of a ruse.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, he
knew something was not

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.192 align:middle line:84%
quite right about
the whole thing,

00:34:49.192 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:90%
or suspected that, anyway.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You were telling people since
1989 that there was some sort

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:90%
of hand scanner--

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:90%
it was like, a bone scanner.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:10%
And you tried to describe it.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.250 align:middle line:10%
You said, you think it took
measurements of the bone.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:10%
There were these pegs,
you put your hand on it.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a small plate with some
pins on it that you could put

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.400 align:middle line:90%
between your fingers.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.900 align:middle line:90%

when you walk into the facility

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:10%
or even to leave, they
have a hand reader.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I was told that it
has to do something

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:90%
where it measures the--

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:84%
where bright light measures
the bones in your finger.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.100 align:middle line:90%
They're unique to each person.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It kind of sounds like
something out of a TV show,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:84%
but that's exactly
the way it is.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Man, I look for that kind
of thing all over the internet,

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:10%
never found anything.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:10%
And then, all of a sudden,
this article comes out

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.810 align:middle line:10%
and it says that at the
Nellis Range for the--

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.940 align:middle line:10%
they were talking about
the stealth program.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.155 align:middle line:10%
There was indeed
this hand scanner

00:35:45.155 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:10%
that was used in
these secret programs.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And they just admitted
or announced it publicly.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:10%
And there were some photos.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.230 align:middle line:10%
And I just was interested.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:10%
And so--

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.126 align:middle line:10%
>> I never thought I'd
see one of these again.

00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] But I tried to explain
this to people so many times,

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:10%
and they either didn't
believe me or say,

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.720 align:middle line:10%
yeah, I'm sure there is.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.530 align:middle line:10%
And there it is.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:08.350 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like, a biometric
thing for the hands.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:90%

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.540 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it wasn't all
that advanced back then.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.200 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, that's it.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.050 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe you
found a picture of this.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:10%
I really can't.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:10%
This was the scanner
used to get in to S4.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:10%
And I tried to
explain this to people

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.940 align:middle line:10%
so many times, that there was
pins in, you stuck your hand,

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:10%
a light above, and it
supposedly measured

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.010 align:middle line:10%
the length of the bones in
your hand that, you know,

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.548 align:middle line:10%
was unique in each individual.

00:36:38.548 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:10%
It's exactly,
exactly how it was.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's amazing.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing you
came up with these.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing to see this again.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.807 align:middle line:10%

was a hot ticket.

these little things that you

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:10%
said become public and there's
this tiny bit of vindication?

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:10%
>> It is.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.402 align:middle line:10%
There's little moment
to vindication,

00:37:02.402 --> 00:37:04.770 align:middle line:10%

said these didn't exist

>> One thing that people
say about your story

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and your experience is that
you are a puppet, a marionette,

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that you had no control over
what was going on at that time,

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that you were taken
advantage or compromised,

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're being used as a
source of disinformation.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And what evidence
to support that?

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, man, what's the
evidence to support those

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:90%
claims?

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Is that just something to say?

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying, that's what--

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.493 align:middle line:90%
that's the kind of thing--

00:39:50.493 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> If you make a statement,
you have to have some evidence

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to say where the
statement came from.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:90%
They're basing it on emotion--

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> --and fear.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.640 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid that I'm right.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you've heard
that makes this impossible.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to tell you
exactly the way things were.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Show me the alternate
reality that you believe,

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't lock up
with my actual reality.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where are
those other facts?

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Just show me what they are.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.510 align:middle line:84%
These are the facts you
grab together and painted

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
a different story of
my life than I did.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I thought I set the
record straight 30 years ago.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Can we ever be made
whole if we're not believed,

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:10%
if our life story is
challenged by consensus?

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are not forced
to answer for our past.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.815 align:middle line:84%
We can freely
navigate this moment

00:40:47.815 --> 00:40:51.190 align:middle line:84%
with a reverence for
what came before.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But some people are
placed under a microscope.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:58.186 align:middle line:84%
Their words, their actions,
scrutinized and challenged.

00:40:58.186 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
told quiet lies.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.605 align:middle line:84%
How much can a man take before
he submits to the weight

00:41:04.605 --> 00:41:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and consequence of distrust?

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Does he fade back
into the shadows

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:84%
that formed him or does
he lash out to carve

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:90%
his words into your flesh?

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.500 align:middle line:84%
To carve his words
into your flesh.

What else can I say?

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.350 align:middle line:90%
What else can I say?

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.440 align:middle line:90%
How can I prove anything else?

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.775 align:middle line:10%

What does that mean
about your story?

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think Los Alamos just
hired me out of high school?

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:90%


00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.550 align:middle line:84%
If you don't think
that's possible,

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:54.360 align:middle line:84%
then something had
to happen in between.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand how
everybody gets so caught up

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:01.740 align:middle line:90%
in the minutia.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you can debate
that stuff forever.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.340 align:middle line:84%
We can go back
before MIT, and you

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:84%
can start fighting
whether or not

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and where I lived
in high school.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
That is not going to
translate into answering

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.530 align:middle line:84%
the questions and
the things that I

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:90%
brought into the public eye.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the important stuff.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems like this is
an intentional distraction.

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.310 align:middle line:84%
You need to pay attention
to the bigger picture.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.750 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to research
all the other stuff, fine.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and do it.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But you really need to pay
attention to what I'm saying.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I have better things
to do than come up with this.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
in doing this.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:47.340 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I don't like
being in the public eye.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't have money
for doing this.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly, I could
make up a better lie.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:90%
But I have no motivation to lie.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.430 align:middle line:90%
This hasn't helped me out.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> What does that mean
for Lazar's story,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can't prove
his schooling?

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a problem.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had wondered
can we go forward

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:84%
if we can't verify what was
going on in his background?

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.750 align:middle line:84%
The central point
for me was if he

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:18.428 align:middle line:84%
worked at Los Alamos,
that suggests he had

00:43:18.428 --> 00:43:19.720 align:middle line:90%
to have an education somewhere.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I think he said it to
me a couple of times.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
What do you think, they hired
me right out of high school?

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I looked at people who
knew him back then.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Jim Taliani, for
one who said that,

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.740 align:middle line:84%
yeah, Bob went to
Caltech back then.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.670 align:middle line:90%
I dropped him off.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed another person
who also knew Bob then, and had

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.720 align:middle line:84%
said that he would drop
him off at Caltech,

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:84%
would pick him up
from the library,

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that if he wasn't going to
school there he sure was making

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.550 align:middle line:90%
a good show of it back then.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Would it prove is his story
about working on flying saucers

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:84%
if he could show he had
degrees from Caltech and MIT?

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.460 align:middle line:90%
No, of course not.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It would not prove
any flying saucers.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It would just prove
that he went to school.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The people who
despise him, and who

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:07.307 align:middle line:84%
doubt the story the
most, the debunkers,

00:44:07.307 --> 00:44:09.015 align:middle line:84%
would find something
else to bitch about.

00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Bob got some trouble.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.890 align:middle line:84%
After he became a
worldwide UFO celebrity,

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:84%
he did a typical
Bob sort of thing

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and got mixed up
with some hookers.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:84%
He was helping them set
up a little mini-brothel

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:21.990 align:middle line:90%
in a neighborhood.

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And when he told me about
it, I thought, oh my gosh.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:84%
My professional life is
flashing before my eyes here.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The most high profile witness
in the biggest story I've ever

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
done is now telling
me he's involved

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:90%
in this criminal enterprise.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.207 align:middle line:84%
He kind of thought it was funny,
but it wasn't funny to me.

00:44:38.207 --> 00:44:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So I said, you got
to stop this stuff.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:90%
You got to shut this down.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I called the cops.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I let some people know,
look, he made a mistake.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.470 align:middle line:90%
It's being shut down.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.720 align:middle line:84%
They raided the
place, arrested Bob.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.880 align:middle line:10%
And in those days, there
weren't many people

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:10%
who were ever prosecuted
and arrested for pandering.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Lazar was.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So parole and probation,
they're doing a background

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.460 align:middle line:90%
investigation.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
make a recommendation

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to the court what the sentence
should be for his crimes.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:10%
He tells them the same story--

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.760 align:middle line:10%
where he went to
school, where he worked,

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.610 align:middle line:10%
S4, MIT, Caltech, all that.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.600 align:middle line:90%
And they investigated.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.808 align:middle line:84%
They were having the same
problems that I was having.

00:45:14.808 --> 00:45:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't verify
a lot of this stuff.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:22.200 align:middle line:84%
If Bob truly was a
UFO con man, that

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.060 align:middle line:90%
was the time to come clean.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Because parole and
probation was ticked off.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.380 align:middle line:84%
They thought he was
misleading them.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of that, they were

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:84%
going to recommend-- they did
recommend that he do hard time,

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.160 align:middle line:90%
go to prison.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.055 align:middle line:90%
He knew it.

00:45:37.055 --> 00:45:38.430 align:middle line:10%
That was the time
for him to come

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.010 align:middle line:10%
clean because it was
a much better chance

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.845 align:middle line:10%
that he would not
be sent to prison.

00:45:42.845 --> 00:45:43.645 align:middle line:90%
He didn't.

00:45:43.645 --> 00:45:44.610 align:middle line:90%
He stuck to his story.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.580 align:middle line:84%
He told them the same
story that he told me.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:84%
That went a long way for
me in showing that he

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.140 align:middle line:90%
had been telling the truth.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:10%
Because it was definitely
in his own self-interest

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.250 align:middle line:10%
to fess up at that point
and that's not what he did.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.760 align:middle line:10%
He stuck to his guns.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.560 align:middle line:10%
Here's the thing.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.410 align:middle line:10%
OK, I can see this art pranks
the UFO world and the UFO

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.210 align:middle line:10%
community.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I can see him doing
something like that.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But does he lie to
his mom and dad?

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Does he lie to his wife?

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Does he lie to all
of his close friends

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and tell them the same story
and try to get away with it?

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:19.860 align:middle line:10%
You look back on the
people who knew him

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.840 align:middle line:10%
while this was going
on, who knew him

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.140 align:middle line:10%
before he was hired to work
out at S4, who knew him

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.110 align:middle line:10%
during the time he was going
back and forth out there,

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:32.070 align:middle line:10%
and who stuck by him
after this whirlwind

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:35.800 align:middle line:10%
of international publicity kind
of rained down on his head.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who knew him,
everyone who was close to him

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.190 align:middle line:84%
supports his story and says
he's telling the truth.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.500 align:middle line:10%
>> You saw something up here
that you think might have

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:10%
been--

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:44.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I hate--

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.820 align:middle line:10%
I really hate to say stuff
that I can't put my hands on

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.380 align:middle line:10%
and say this is
absolutely for sure.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:50.728 align:middle line:90%
Well, what did you see?

00:46:50.728 --> 00:46:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I walked down the hallway
at one time I was working out

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:56.400 align:middle line:90%
there, and there were doors--

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
the doors that go
to the hangars,

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.490 align:middle line:84%
the smaller doors
from the corridors,

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.310 align:middle line:84%
have a 9 inch or 12
inch square window

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.260 align:middle line:84%
with little wires
running through it, just

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.360 align:middle line:90%
about head level.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I was walking
by, I just glanced in.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.906 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed at a quick
glance, there was--

00:47:12.906 --> 00:47:17.840 align:middle line:84%
there were two guys in
white lab coats facing me

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:90%
towards the door.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking down
and talking to something small

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.190 align:middle line:90%
with long arms.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.863 align:middle line:84%
Now I was just surprised
that I walked by

00:47:26.863 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:90%
and I only caught a glimpse.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what
on Earth that was.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> People say you saw an alien.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Did you see an alien at S4, Bob?

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think I
saw an alien at S4.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're
splitting hairs here.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
This had to do with a
glance through a window

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't supposed
to be looking at, anyway.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still convinced
I looked in the window

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and I think these guys had a
doll in a small chair, which

00:47:56.050 --> 00:48:00.290 align:middle line:84%
was similar to what
was in the craft.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think they were just
looking at dimensions,

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.390 align:middle line:90%
and they put something in there.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I just took it a
glance, and it was just,

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, something tiny
sitting in the chair.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there is an
alien there posing for them.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I think they just had a
small character of something

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and doing measurements
or something.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're thinking about
like, a 400 millisecond glance.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So now, how much can
you see out of that?

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I never saw any aliens
walking around there.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I never heard anybody saying
anything about living aliens.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.320 align:middle line:90%
So I don't think that was it.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But they did have a
nickname for the aliens.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The kids.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.920 align:middle line:90%
The kids.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.818 align:middle line:90%
[OMINOUS MUSIC]

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Is someone else here?

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Maybe visitors, interested in
us, in our genes, in our souls.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're property,
just a goddamn commodity.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.440 align:middle line:90%
We're like livestock.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they'd like our condors
and cupcakes, the kimono

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:11.195 align:middle line:90%
or the top hat.

00:49:11.195 --> 00:49:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Who the fuck knows?

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe every single
sighting of things

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.430 align:middle line:84%
the sky is a product of our
collective consciousness,

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:84%
a false hope that humanity
desperately needs intervention

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.560 align:middle line:90%
by external powers.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.190 align:middle line:84%
We've always looked to
the skies for answers

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:33.783 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking
into ourselves.

00:49:33.783 --> 00:49:37.110 align:middle line:90%


00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.350 align:middle line:10%
So at what point--

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.920 align:middle line:10%
describe the evolution of
your knowledge here, I mean,

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.120 align:middle line:10%
that you realize that this
thing you're working on

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:47.157 align:middle line:10%
came out of a flying saucer.

00:49:47.157 --> 00:49:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, I know
that technology doesn't exist

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:50.290 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it doesn't.

00:49:52.557 --> 00:49:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Take my word for it.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:50:01.630 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's-- it's just
technology that doesn't exist

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.430 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're talking about--

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.790 align:middle line:84%
science doesn't even know
what gravity is, much less how

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.440 align:middle line:90%
to produce it or control it.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And here is a device that's
producing it and controlling it

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and using it as propulsion.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You're telling me
there's a different physics.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:22.620 align:middle line:10%
That was your job.

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.940 align:middle line:10%
You were working on that.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The science was something
we were trying to figure out.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.090 align:middle line:84%
But we knew how the
devices would operate.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
propulsion of the craft--

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:36.240 align:middle line:84%
everything that we have,
whether it's a propeller

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.190 align:middle line:90%
plane or a jet or a rocket--

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:44.150 align:middle line:84%
it throws something out the
back, either high speed exhaust

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:middle line:90%
or a large volume of air.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.110 align:middle line:90%
It's an action-reaction force.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The action is you throw
something out the back

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:51.790 align:middle line:90%
and it moves you forward.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.210 align:middle line:90%
It's how everything works.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time there is a craft

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.760 align:middle line:90%
that it's a reactionless craft.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a field propulsion craft.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And what it does, is it creates
a distortion in space and time

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.880 align:middle line:84%
in front of it, where
space actually bends.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And my analogy to
that has always

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.030 align:middle line:84%
been put a bowling ball
in the middle of your bed.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And then a foot in front of it,
take your fist and push down

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:17.510 align:middle line:90%
on the mattress.

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.163 align:middle line:84%
The bowling ball
will roll towards it.

00:51:20.163 --> 00:51:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
how the craft worked.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It creates a distortion
right in front of it,

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.150 align:middle line:90%
and the craft falls forward.

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a different
physics that we're--

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the science that
explains how the technology

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.000 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all encompassed
is one thing, alien technology

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and science.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the big picture?

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:44.090 align:middle line:84%
What is the takeaway of your
story after you're gone?

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.770 align:middle line:84%
You're not a rebel kid with the
jet car at Los Alamos today.

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Today's a different Bob Lazar.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>> What have we learned?

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:84%
What's the message
of your story?

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The big thing is the
suppression of extremely

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:04.370 align:middle line:84%
advanced technology, and the
suppression of unknown science.

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:05.840 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Those two things, to
me, is the only thing

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that's important about what
was going on out there.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's
another civilization.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And, like I've
said before, that's

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.320 align:middle line:84%
a crime not to tell
humanity about that.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's a separate thing.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Meaning that there is
something different in science

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:32.380 align:middle line:84%
dramatically that we're
not allowed to know?

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That is a true statement.

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
a true statement.

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that there
is another intelligent,

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.580 align:middle line:84%
technologically
advanced civilization,

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:90%
we have some of their objects--

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> That is really the
pinnacle, that there is another

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.520 align:middle line:84%
civilization in existence that's
intelligent that we know about.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have artifacts
from them that can operate.

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, that's
a big, big deal.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind, there's
a lot to deal with that.

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.690 align:middle line:84%
However, the science
and the technology

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:17.110 align:middle line:90%
can change us dramatically.

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It can change the way the
entire world operates,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:22.540 align:middle line:90%
the economy, everything.

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So those stick out in my mind
as being critically important.

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And we have it.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, we have them.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
believe it, but we do.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And you've seen it.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:39.256 align:middle line:90%
>> I've seen it.

00:53:39.256 --> 00:53:41.193 align:middle line:90%
>> And you have touched it.

was when I actually

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.150 align:middle line:90%
got to look inside the disc.

The seats in the panel

were very small.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They were, perhaps, that far
off the ground, like something

small.

I mean, specific things
you might have missed.

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:16.270 align:middle line:10%
I basically wanted to
try everything I could

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:17.830 align:middle line:10%
to prove what I was saying.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.520 align:middle line:10%
So this was just another tool.

>> --to recall--

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.290 align:middle line:10%
And I had had it
done to me before.

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:29.950 align:middle line:10%
So I had proven that yeah,
this really does do something.

Let's try and remember
some fine details or--

>> You wanted to recall some
physics that you learned there.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:37.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:37.880 align:middle line:10%
I wanted--

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:38.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Some technical stuff.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.090 align:middle line:10%

much as I possibly could.

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:43.040 align:middle line:10%
I mean, so much went
through my mind.

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.640 align:middle line:10%
Just imagine all the
things you were seeing,

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.817 align:middle line:10%
and every one is
completely fascinating

00:56:49.817 --> 00:56:51.400 align:middle line:10%
and something you
haven't seen before.

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.200 align:middle line:10%
It's just data overload.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.880 align:middle line:10%
So I was hoping
that hypnosis would

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.250 align:middle line:10%
get me relaxed enough where
maybe-- everything was

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.810 align:middle line:10%
packed so tight together.

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:03.450 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I could just start
thumbing through things

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:07.080 align:middle line:10%
and just pick up even a
couple of little more tidbits

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.940 align:middle line:10%
could paint a bigger picture.

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:13.470 align:middle line:10%
And I could, you know,
possibly explain things better

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:17.940 align:middle line:10%
or possibly locate some of
these other guys or anything,

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:19.470 align:middle line:10%
any bit of information.

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:22.270 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, and it
was pretty handy.

00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:25.130 align:middle line:10%
>> So you did recall
some things technically.

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:29.894 align:middle line:10%

probably others, too.

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:46.700 align:middle line:84%

does something and
you don't remember it.

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
your life changes.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.870 align:middle line:90%

Double your relaxation
and the number 99

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.950 align:middle line:84%
from this moment on you

the material that you seek.

00:58:55.190 --> 00:59:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And no one or nothing,

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.900 align:middle line:90%
will stand in your way.

Bob, Bob, Bob, you will
remember because you desire

At one point he was in hypnosis.

I think he was
drawing a reactor.

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:35.820 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to recall
what was in the books.

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.830 align:middle line:90%
He saw it in the book.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I told him, when you
come up and open your eyes,

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:44.040 align:middle line:90%
you'll be able to draw.

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And he did, but it didn't
mean anything to him.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But it was a drawing
that he drew this way.

00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no way.

00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> But it was this way.

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And so afterwards, he looked
at it and he came back over

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and sat down here for a while.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh, that's because
all I had to do was turn it.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's the super conscious.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And literal, the subconscious
takes things literal.

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.708 align:middle line:84%
It's like the mind is
absorbing all this stuff,

01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and then he discovers what
his mind had absorbed.

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:21.260 align:middle line:90%
He's remembering.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I was writing so fast.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't imagine what
you were thinking, too.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you're discovering
with them, the kind of shock.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.140 align:middle line:90%
What's the truth?

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Hypnosis is the best possible
tool of getting to the truth.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
If a person makes
things up normally,

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
they can lie under hypnosis just
as easily as out of hypnosis.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But if they're really trying
to get to and retrieve

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.462 align:middle line:84%
information, then it's the
best tool that I know of.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
He came in to find out
what he didn't know.

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
We were able to go
back, overcome the fear,

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:04.590 align:middle line:90%
and bring forth those memories.

He says he and other
government employees

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.280 align:middle line:10%
would gather near EG&G
fly to Groom Lake,

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.290 align:middle line:10%
then very few people would get
into a bus with blacked out

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
It's got a slope of probably
about 30 degrees, which

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:35.420 align:middle line:90%
are hangar doors.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.422 align:middle line:84%
And it has textured paint on
it, but it looks like sand.

01:01:38.422 --> 01:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It's made to look like
the side of the mountain

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's in, whether it's
to disguise it from satellite

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:43.550 align:middle line:90%
photographs or what--

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> He says he was never told
exactly what he'd be working

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
on, but figured it had something
to do with advanced propulsion.

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
On his first day he was told
to read a series of briefings,

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and immediately realized how
advanced the propulsion was.

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The power sources
and antimatter reactor,

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:02.060 align:middle line:90%
they run gravity amplifiers.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
There's actually two parts
to the drive mechanism.

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a bizarre technology.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no physical
hook up between any

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:13.270 align:middle line:90%
of the systems in there.

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:16.280 align:middle line:84%
They use gravity as a wave,
using wave guides almost

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.380 align:middle line:90%
like microwaves.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Polygrapher Terry Tavernetti
runs a corporate security

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.750 align:middle line:84%
operation, and is a former
Los Angeles police officer.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
He put Lazar through four
tests, and concluded there

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.300 align:middle line:90%
was no attempt to deceive.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And I left there thinking
that I feel we do have some

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.080 align:middle line:10%
credibility to what
the subject had to say.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I went
to some of my colleagues.

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.327 align:middle line:84%
>> Tavernetti sent the test
results to a third polygrapher,

01:02:41.327 --> 01:02:43.035 align:middle line:84%
who agreed the results
appeared truthful.

01:02:43.035 --> 01:02:45.540 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Bob has explained
to me multiple times,

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.950 align:middle line:10%
he tried everything in his
power to prove his story.

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to feel
better for myself.

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So I said, hey, would
you be willing to undergo

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:56.120 align:middle line:90%
a polygraph test?

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.010 align:middle line:90%
He did not hesitate.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
He said yes.

01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Four different tests on four
different areas Bob's claims,

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and he said afterward there was
no attempt to deceive at all.

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:08.180 align:middle line:84%
He's telling what he
believes to be the truth.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.660 align:middle line:10%
I have asked the question
many times over the years--

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.020 align:middle line:10%
how did Bob Lazar know this
stuff if he wasn't there?

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.760 align:middle line:10%
He knew there was
a place called S4.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.690 align:middle line:10%
I had called Nellis Air Force
Base Public Information Office.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
They confirmed for me there
really was a place called S4.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Now there's no news
story, prior to Bob Lazar,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.970 align:middle line:90%
about any place called S4.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:26.770 align:middle line:90%
He knew about it.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
He also knew that EG&G had
arranged to hire personnel,

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that if you were going
to getting a job out

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
at Groom Lake, EG&G was
the company that you

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:36.820 align:middle line:90%
would go through.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:40.278 align:middle line:84%
He knew that there had been
investigators at his home

01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:41.320 align:middle line:90%
for the background check.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.820 align:middle line:90%
He remembered the guy's name.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.715 align:middle line:84%
It was an odd
name, Mike Thigpen.

01:03:44.715 --> 01:03:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And how did he know?

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
How did he know
that Mike Thigpen

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
works for a federal agency
that does this stuff?

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> After 30 years and
this guy dodging you,

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I found Mike Thigpen.

01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:57.050 align:middle line:90%
I found Thigpen.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't believe it.

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>> He's on the East Coast.

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I called him.

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:03.530 align:middle line:10%
I've talked with
him multiple times.

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:05.770 align:middle line:10%
You know, he won't go on
camera because he doesn't

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:09.010 align:middle line:10%
want to kind of put a
dark shadow upon the work

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:09.850 align:middle line:10%
that he did before.

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:15.040 align:middle line:10%
But personally, he conveyed
to me that that was his job.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.270 align:middle line:10%
That was exactly what he
did in Las Vegas in 1989.

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:21.190 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, he
remembers Bob Lazar.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the most important
thing Bob knew is that they

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
were flying something that looks
exactly like a flying saucer

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:31.230 align:middle line:84%
over Papoose Lake, and they
flew on Wednesday nights.

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:34.210 align:middle line:10%
And he took people out
there three weeks in a row

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.200 align:middle line:10%
and showed it to them.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And at least once, maybe twice,
they recorded it on video.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.040 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.060 align:middle line:90%
How did Bob know that?

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
There have been no
stories about test flights

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and flying saucers
at Papoose Lake.

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way,
that's where it was.

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't over Groom Lake,
it was over Papoose Lake.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.680 align:middle line:10%
We checked out so many
details that Bob had told us

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.210 align:middle line:10%
that turned out to be true--

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:58.960 align:middle line:10%
the existence of S4,
element 115 really

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.820 align:middle line:10%
did become an
element years later

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.810 align:middle line:10%
that Bob had been
consulted by the lab which

01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:07.410 align:middle line:10%
screened synthesized
man-made element 115.

01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole
long string of things

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.640 align:middle line:90%
that he knew checked out.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>> These milestones
along the way--

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:16.893 align:middle line:10%
no matter how much
we nit pick it apart,

01:05:16.893 --> 01:05:19.060 align:middle line:10%
no matter how much people
don't want to believe it--

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.310 align:middle line:10%
the evidence that he's
telling the truth outweighs

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.670 align:middle line:10%
the evidence that he's not.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:24.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I agree with you.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.360 align:middle line:10%
And if I did not believe
that, I would not still

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.860 align:middle line:10%
be working on the story.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.831 align:middle line:10%
I would not be publicly
defending Bob Lazar.

01:05:31.831 --> 01:05:34.717 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:05:34.717 --> 01:05:37.610 align:middle line:90%


01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:39.560 align:middle line:10%
>> What was your function
in working on this?

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.700 align:middle line:10%
You were doing
What was your job?

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We were to reverse engineer
the power and propulsion system

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
of this craft, and see if it
can be duplicated with available

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
materials.

01:05:57.170 --> 01:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to go over with
you what it is that you saw,

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
to draw it out for
people, to make a sketch.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
As you're seeing it, as if
you're there at that moment,

01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:11.445 align:middle line:90%
kind of go back in the path.

01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So the thing I
termed the sport model--

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
underneath this floor
there are three--

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:22.200 align:middle line:90%


01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.590 align:middle line:90%
three large centrical devices.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
These are on mounts that allow
them to completely swivel up

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to 180 degrees and in
a 360 degree rotation.

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Directly above each one it's
a small, rectangular object.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.900 align:middle line:90%
This is on the floor above.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And these are the gravity
amplifiers themselves.

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Looking down from the top
you'd have the center.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
In the very center,
there is a small reactor.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Surrounding this, in three
equally spaced areas,

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.100 align:middle line:90%
are the amplifiers.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is looking
at it sideways.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.440 align:middle line:84%
This is looking at
it down from the top.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And under these amplifiers,
underneath on the floor

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:19.750 align:middle line:90%
below, are the gravity emitters.

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's the reactor here
powering the gravity

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:26.050 align:middle line:84%
amplifiers, gravity
amplifiers output

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
goes into the gravity
emitters at the bottom.

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And the resulting gravity
beam or anti-gravity wave

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
can be pretty much put
anywhere you want to.

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:42.070 align:middle line:90%
There was another level up here.

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Now I had access and was
permitted to view and look

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
at the operation of this
main level with the gravity

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
amplifiers and the level
below, the gravity emitters.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a level above, which
consisted of these two areas

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not all
that familiar with.

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I assume these to be some
sort of navigational engine.

01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
People call these large,
black, rectangular areas

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:16.260 align:middle line:90%
on the top portholes.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:21.029 align:middle line:84%
I believe they were some
plane or a sensor array that

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:23.640 align:middle line:84%
just took in information
from the surrounding

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:29.680 align:middle line:84%
area, whether it be patterns
of stars or what have you.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.399 align:middle line:84%
And there was their version
of a computer or something

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to make determinations
here, that

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.319 align:middle line:84%
takes input from
those sensors and then

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
let the craft know
how to orient itself,

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:42.340 align:middle line:90%
and where it was in space.

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:45.609 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
assume to be up there.

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:48.899 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for a fact, again,
that was not part of my job.

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was only led
to believe that.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The center antenna is
really an extension

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:57.760 align:middle line:90%
of the reactor in the center.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.939 align:middle line:84%
And that's a wave
guide, which allows

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
the emission of the
gravity wave, which

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
forms kind of a heart
shape over the whole craft.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how it creates
its distortion.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:16.800 align:middle line:84%
These gravity emitters can
be swung all the way up

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
to 180 degrees.

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And this allows the craft
to essentially stand

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.189 align:middle line:84%
on two of them and hover, while
this one swings up and creates

01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
a distortion in front of
it, allowing the craft

where you see flying saucers
just flying on like that,

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.609 align:middle line:90%
they actually fly belly first.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The craft flies along, leaves
the atmosphere of the planet.

01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It turns its belly
to the destination.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The three amplifiers focus
in on the destination,

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.770 align:middle line:90%
and that's how it proceeds.

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
the operation of it,

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%

01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But I just pulled up,
got out, picked the key,

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and then they started
talking from behind me.

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
really strange.

01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it got much
stranger as the day went on.

01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> What got stranger about it?

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's just the sheer
amount of people that came,

01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:19.420 align:middle line:90%
agency after agency.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had
computer experts here

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.790 align:middle line:84%
going through all the computer
equipment we had here.

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
They had people sectioning
off the building,

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
labeling it in cubic meters,
so they can search each one.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, what they were looking
for is just an order form,

01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:38.860 align:middle line:90%
so very strange.

01:17:41.412 --> 01:18:00.750 align:middle line:90%


01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>> You've been raided two times?

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Twice, by more agencies
than I can really recall.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.730 align:middle line:90%
The FDA, to the NRC, the FBI--

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:14.220 align:middle line:90%
but they usually come en masse.

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:17.695 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard to
pick out who's who.

01:18:17.695 --> 01:18:19.528 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is Beryllium?

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is it
used for again?

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It's used in aerospace.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:28.870 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty lightweight,
quite strong,

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:34.080 align:middle line:10%
and a high temperature metal.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that
you were shaken down,

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to some degree you're
being fucked with?

01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think they're
just fucking with me.

01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced there's
ulterior motives.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I firmly suspect that
there's a lot more to it

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
than they're
saying, that they're

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.860 align:middle line:90%
looking for something else.

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%


01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What they're supposed
to do is tie you up,

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
put you in the
middle of the room,

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.070 align:middle line:84%
have everyone watching you,
so that you can collaborate

01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
a story or try to
trick them or whatnot.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So they just kept us
all in separate rooms.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It was bomb squad,
computer squad--

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I think they have, like,
a biological hazard squad,

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:18.720 align:middle line:90%
HAZMAT squad.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It made the full
gamut because they

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what
we had in our shop

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
or what we're capable of or
are we going to retaliate

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.820 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So it was pretty much like the
full Michigan FBI was here.

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:32.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they had the van.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.520 align:middle line:90%
They had multiple cars lined up.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.610 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, in looking at
Bob's life there's always this

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:42.840 align:middle line:10%
suspicion that there's something
more going on shaking him down.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because he had that
experience before.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is the second
time that I know

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.110 align:middle line:90%
of that he's gotten raided.

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:52.108 align:middle line:84%
So he's always had
this kind of knowledge

01:19:52.108 --> 01:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%
that there's somebody watching.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
No matter what he does, there's
always somebody watching you.

01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And it does have to be
related to the Area 51

01:19:59.180 --> 01:19:59.980 align:middle line:90%
stuff and all that.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.145 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You know, they
kind of put him on a list.

01:20:02.145 --> 01:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I think they do like toying with
him and keeping an eye on him.

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:07.732 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe that
it's like they're opening up

01:20:07.732 --> 01:20:09.690 align:middle line:84%
a 30-year-old file and
they're like, all right,

01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
we're going to crack
down on the Bob story.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to find out
if he had-- what he has,

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.590 align:middle line:90%
what information he's got.

01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they're
necessarily doing that.

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:17.308 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that
there is, like,

01:20:17.308 --> 01:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
a culture maybe within these
agencies, of they know who

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.410 align:middle line:90%
this guy is and they'll have--

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
they'll look for any reason that
they can to kind of poke him

01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:27.600 align:middle line:84%
with some thorns and
make sure that he

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.830 align:middle line:90%
knows who's watching him.

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:30.780 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:36.060 align:middle line:10%
It's too coincidental for
it all to be just some luck

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.170 align:middle line:10%
of the draw, basically.

01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.697 align:middle line:10%
There's something going on.

01:20:38.697 --> 01:20:42.520 align:middle line:90%

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody knows, the story
is that you got some element 115

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:47.460 align:middle line:90%
out of Los Alamos.

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.090 align:middle line:90%
That's public knowledge.

01:20:49.090 --> 01:20:51.490 align:middle line:10%
Something you said
a while back--

01:20:51.490 --> 01:20:54.198 align:middle line:10%
do you think that what
happened had to do with that?

01:20:54.198 --> 01:20:55.240 align:middle line:10%
>> We're not going there.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:03.870 align:middle line:90%


01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they trying to shake you
down to find the 115 that you

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
said 30 years ago that
you got out of the lab?

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.710 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
ask that, so let's just

01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
address that if you feel
comfortable addressing it.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.812 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:21:18.812 --> 01:21:20.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you not feel
comfortable addressing that?

01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:22.770 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I don't feel
comfortable addressing that.

01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:28.750 align:middle line:90%


01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.930 align:middle line:84%
You would think after 30 years,
who cares what I have to say?

01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:40.930 align:middle line:90%

01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:51.280 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm more convinced than ever
that the key to this story is

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.750 align:middle line:10%
element 115.

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
If you could get to that piece
and have it independently

01:21:56.530 --> 01:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
analyzed, I think it would
prove beyond all question

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
that it came from
somewhere else.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.810 align:middle line:90%
We didn't make it.

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And it would go a long way
toward establishing the story

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.830 align:middle line:90%
that was told by Bob Lazar.

01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:07.630 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:09.010 align:middle line:90%
So I think about that a lot.

01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I think about the cloud
chamber experiment.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of emails from
people who say, oh, god.

Where's this video?

01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:16.780 align:middle line:84%
You owe it to the world
to show this video.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Cough it up.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, look,
I've looked for it.

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I've got all these
boxes of crap,

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, and tape,
and news clippings.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked for it
and I can't find it.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody like
you comes and talks

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
to me about the
Bob Lazar story, it

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.827 align:middle line:90%
gets the juices flowing again.

01:22:32.827 --> 01:22:33.910 align:middle line:90%
You know, I can't help it.

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:34.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm human.

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I want
to go find that tape.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:42.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I went through every tape
that Bob had in his personal

form archive.

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
tapes, on the outside

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.880 align:middle line:84%
in tiny, tiny little
scribble said, Cloud Chamber.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, there's
about just less than a minute

01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
of that cloud
chamber test on tape.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
I have it.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> People have been so
pissed at me over the years.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.723 align:middle line:84%
I can't find that tape or they
think I'm hiding it on purpose.

01:23:03.723 --> 01:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But I've looked
everywhere for it.

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you found
it, that's awesome.

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:09.583 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the deal.

01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:13.160 align:middle line:84%
In typical Bob Lazar
fashion, there's only about

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.600 align:middle line:90%
a minute of it.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
However, after all
these years, 30 years,

01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:18.590 align:middle line:90%
we have some footage of it.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't prove shit
because it's recorded.

01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I was there that night that
they did the cloud chamber

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.730 align:middle line:90%
test.

01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:27.225 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell you what it was.

01:23:27.225 --> 01:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
a cloud chamber was.

01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
This beam of light was
bent, and it was bent

01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:36.027 align:middle line:84%
because they had element 115
in as part of the experiment.

01:23:36.027 --> 01:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that's
pretty important.

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:40.160 align:middle line:84%
That would be huge to
include in the story.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.070 align:middle line:10%
>> I spent time trying to
understand why everybody was

01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:46.190 align:middle line:10%
saying this 115 being
stabilized is pseudoscience.

01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:49.460 align:middle line:10%
So I called some of the top
heavy element physicists

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:53.510 align:middle line:10%
on the planet from Russia,
to up in San Francisco,

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:55.220 align:middle line:10%
to Washington DC.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.190 align:middle line:10%
And I spoke with
about eight or nine,

01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:00.830 align:middle line:10%
but three in particular
who would really talk to me

01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:02.240 align:middle line:10%
in-depth about it.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
All of them, across the board,
said you cannot rule out

01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:09.950 align:middle line:84%
a stabilized version
of element 115.

01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:13.910 align:middle line:10%
In fact, that we
believe it is theorized

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:17.210 align:middle line:10%
that in the island of stability
that it would and could

01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:18.860 align:middle line:10%
and probably does exist.

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.600 align:middle line:10%
So their way of saying it
is we can't rule it out.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.530 align:middle line:10%
So all these people saying
that is pseudoscience, what

01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:26.030 align:middle line:10%
Bob said about element 115--

01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:28.850 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to find out
is it pseudoscience.

01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And definitively, we cannot
rule out a stabilized form

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:33.960 align:middle line:90%
of element 115.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry.

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.620 align:middle line:10%
It is not pseudoscience.

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:39.950 align:middle line:10%
And after doing this
research, that argument

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:41.930 align:middle line:10%
no longer holds water.

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:44.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Makes perfect sense
that it could stable.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.320 align:middle line:10%
And scientists have
said it for a long time.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.310 align:middle line:10%
So, of course, you
can't rule it out.

01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:52.580 align:middle line:10%
Again, if you want
to disbelieve Bob,

01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:56.355 align:middle line:10%
if you want to cross him off
the list and say he's a fraud,

01:24:56.355 --> 01:25:00.350 align:middle line:10%
then your research
goes one inch deep,

01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:02.800 align:middle line:10%
and you say element
115, as he described it,

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.660 align:middle line:10%
can't exist, and then move on.

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be honest about
it and dig further into it

01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and understand it,
then you're going

01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to find out that, in fact,
what Bob says does make sense.

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:16.918 align:middle line:90%
It can be true.

>> Element 115 effects gravity.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Element 115 produces its
own gravitational energy.

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
It had a very specific
manufacturing technique.

01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know how
that information came to be.

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Its code name was LA 1,000.

01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what it was
referred to off-site.

01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Its purpose was supposed to be--

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
again, this is just
a code and deception,

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:10.840 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be
an advanced armor.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's an unusual material.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So now we can take
it to a national lab,

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
this is LA 1,000,
classified material.

01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:20.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a very advanced armor.

01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
That takes care of
all weird questions.

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So you immediately
start operating on lies.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:40.120 align:middle line:84%
This fuel is in the form of
just a three dimensional thin

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.850 align:middle line:90%
triangle, full rounded edges.

01:26:42.850 --> 01:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat copper in
color, that reddish-brownish.

01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
The way this is manufactured
is really critical.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not just cut out of
a heavy sheet of material.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:04.020 align:middle line:84%
A cylinder of this
material is taken.

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:08.400 align:middle line:90%
This is machined into a cone.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.930 align:middle line:90%


01:27:10.930 --> 01:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The outer part of shaved off
using a lathe or something

01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
like that, until you have
a three dimensional cone.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Once you have the cone,
it's sliced like this.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.590 align:middle line:90%


01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And these slices become that.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Now even this starting
piece, the solid cylinder,

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.960 align:middle line:90%
is not even a solid cylinder.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It consists of many
disks, stacked up.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:50.250 align:middle line:90%


01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And these are fused
together to produce that.

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And all of these steps
are necessary to produce

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:58.773 align:middle line:84%
a successful triangle
that brings fuel.

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So actually, you
know, if you were

01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to look at how this came
to be, this would actually

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.340 align:middle line:84%
be pieces of all
these disks that

01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.795 align:middle line:90%
were cut at unusual angles.

01:28:09.795 --> 01:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%


01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Now apparently, if you don't
do all this, that doesn't work.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, that's the
extent of my knowledge on this.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:26.310 align:middle line:84%
This makes no sense
anywhere, but that's

01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:27.930 align:middle line:90%
what it takes for it to operate.

01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Now with the alien technology
that was present in the craft,

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:37.400 align:middle line:84%
it takes that basis, that
extra gravitational energy

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:43.320 align:middle line:84%
in a small reactor, amplifies
it through the equipment

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
there, directs it
through the wave guides

01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and archways into the
emitters, and allows

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:56.700 align:middle line:84%
it to propel the craft and
manipulate the gravity wave

01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:57.940 align:middle line:90%
for whatever use they want.
