00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE VOICE: In the
mid 80s fewer than 3%

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
of all people in
most of our countries

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:84%
were using cell
phones, but you fast

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
forward to today when
almost 100% of people

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:90%
using cell phones--

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
MALE VOICE: By the time
they're 19 or 20 years old,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
they will have used
the phone for 10 years

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.375 align:middle line:84%
and we have no idea what
type of risk that's carrying.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:84%
We've immersed
ourselves in an ocean

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic radiation.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It's all around us now,
invisible, we can't see it,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:90%
but we know it's there.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Every time you lift
up your mobile phone

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.326 align:middle line:90%
you know it's there.

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very hard to
turn the clock back, if not

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:84%
impossible to turn
the clock back,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
but we need to be aware
of those health effects

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
so that we have the choice
of taking precaution

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:90%
against the exposures.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:84%
At present, the World
Health Organization

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
statements regarding
this are that it is real.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We were not the only cancer
cluster around a phone mast.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
There are many cancer
clusters around phone masts.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Most of the cancers which will
arrive haven't arrived yet.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
How could we have possibly
thought putting microwaves

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:90%
to our brain was safe?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We just don't fully understand
yet what we're doing.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.705 align:middle line:84%
We have an announcement
finally on whether cell

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:90%
phones cause cancer.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: An
unknown scientist is

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.606 align:middle line:84%
about to make a discovery that
should have changed everything.

00:02:55.606 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:10%
His name was Winifred
Otto Schumann.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
On the day in question, he
was teaching his students

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
about the physics
of electricity,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
how a sphere within a sphere
can create electrical tension

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.135 align:middle line:90%
and subsequently a frequency.

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Schumann's class had struggled
to understand the subject.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So to make it easier the
professor instructed them

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:84%
to imagine the Earth as one
sphere and the ionosphere

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:90%
as another.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
He then asked them to
calculate the tension

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:90%
that would exist in between.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Having no idea himself, Schumann
also began to calculate.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, he arrived at
a frequency, a frequency

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.751 align:middle line:90%
of approximately 10 Hertz.

00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.896 align:middle line:84%
As incredible as it
seemed to Schumann,

00:03:54.896 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
our planet had a pulse,
a measurable frequency

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:90%
that surrounded life on Earth.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Although the professor
was proud of his find,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
he didn't see it is a hugely
significant one especially

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
as it was only published
in a small science journal

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
confined to the back
pages under the heading

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:90%
of "Schumann-Resonanz."

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It would take several years
and an incredible twist of fate

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
before the professor will begin
to realize the true importance

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:90%
of Schumann resonance.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
That twist of fate
that began 30 years

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
earlier with another
German scientist

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Hans Berger.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Using an EEG machine
he had built himself,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Berger made the
first ever recording

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:84%
of electrical frequency
transmitted by the human brain.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It was initially suggested the
wave be named after the man who

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
discovered it, but
Berger being a modest man

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:84%
elected for an alphabetical name
and called it the alpha wave.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after Professor
Schumann's discovery,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
one of Hans Berger's
colleagues, a man

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
named Dr. Ankermueller
happened to stumble

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
upon a bedraggled copy of a
small, scientific journal,

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
the exact same small,
scientific journal

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that Professor Schumann's
discovery had been published

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:90%
in several years before.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
He read the piece several times
shaking his head in disbelief.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.387 align:middle line:84%
He realized instantly
the magnitude

00:05:34.387 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:90%
of what was in front of him.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of the alpha
waves recorded by Hans Berger

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
were almost identical
to Schumann resonance,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.446 align:middle line:90%
the frequency of the Earth.

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ankermueller immediately
contacted Schumann to convince

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:90%
him to investigate further.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Schumann agreed and worked
alongside one of his students

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%
to refine his discovery.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
They studied in
detail how tension

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
is discharged by lightning in
the Earth ionosphere cavity.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, they came up
with an exact frequency.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
The pulse of the Earth,
Schumann resonance,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:90%
was exactly 7.83 Hertz.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:90%
The discovery was remarkable.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:10%
Schumann resonance wasn't just
similar to the alpha waves

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain,
it was identical.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
The brain's frequency which
controlled our creativity,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
our performance, our stress,
anxiety, and our immune system

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
had somehow tuned into the
frequency of the planet.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.826 align:middle line:84%
The pulse of the Earth had
become the pulse of life

00:06:51.826 --> 00:06:52.525 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of a wave
is measured in Hertz.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
This refers to the
number of oscillations

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:90%
the wave makes each second.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Frequencies range
from a billionth

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the size of an atom to the
length of the universe itself.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
In theory, frequencies
are infinite,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:90%
so ultimately endless.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
If this was a coincidence, it
was nature's most spectacular.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:90%
So what did all this mean?

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't long before
somebody tried to find out.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.495 align:middle line:84%
His name was Rutger Wever,
an acclaimed scientist

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:41.495 align:middle line:90%
from the Max Planck Institute.

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1960s,
the professor

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:84%
constructed an underground
bunker in order

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to examine the circadian
rhythms of man.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The circadian rhythm
is the day-night cycle

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:90%
that is engraved into all life.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:10%
Over a 30 year
period, the professor

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:10%
conducted experiments in which
student volunteers would spend

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:10%
several weeks at a time
living in the bunker

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:10%
completely shielded from
the natural resonances

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.756 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth.

00:08:12.756 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:10%
In his results, Wever noted
some astonishing findings.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:10%
He discovered that when Schumann
resonance was filtered out

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:10%
of the bunker, the
student's physical

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:10%
and mental health would suffer.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:90%
He took students down there.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:84%
He didn't trust to do it
with ill or old people.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
He took young students down
there because Wever knew

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that there would be an effect.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:10%
So obviously underground you
don't have Schumann resonance,

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:10%
you only have the
transverse magnetic fields

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:10%
from in the earth.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So by putting them
underground, they started

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:90%
feeling sick, having headaches.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Their circadian rhythm
was completely upset.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing was when
he just introduced the 7.8

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Hertz frequency with the
magnetic pulse generator,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.214 align:middle line:90%
that immediately stopped.

00:09:22.214 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Weaver would
secretly introduce

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
the 7.83 frequency to the bunker
by a man-made transmitter.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Each time he did so,
he noted the ill effect

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
suffered by the volunteers
either disappeared

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:90%
or decreased.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Their stress, headaches,
and emotional distress

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
was reduced and
their sense of well

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.942 align:middle line:84%
being was restored all
by the introduction

00:09:43.942 --> 00:09:44.675 align:middle line:90%
of Schumann resonance.

00:09:44.675 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Wever's research had revealed
an incredible connection

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:84%
between human health and
the natural frequency

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And in 2011,
groundbreaking research

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:84%
suggested something
even more impressive,

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that Schumann resonance could
be connected to the beginnings

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
of life itself.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
The breakthrough came at
the hands of Luc Montagnier,

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.120 align:middle line:84%
the Nobel Prize-winning
scientist who

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:90%
first discovered the HIV virus.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
The professor was conducting
water memory experiments

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:84%
examining how water could retain
a memory of substances that had

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:84%
previously been dissolved in it
when he stumbled upon something

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that would challenge the
very principles of science,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:90%
all life comes from life.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a fundamental
principle of science and one

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
which has never been
violated in any experiment.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Life can only exist where
life has existed before

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanism
for this has always

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
been understood to be a material
one, such as egg and sperm

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.087 align:middle line:90%
or spore and cell division.

00:10:56.087 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But Luc Montagnier's
experiments have offered

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:90%
a very different hypothesis.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
The professor showed that DNA
sequences, the very building

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
blocks of life, communicate
with each other in water

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
by emitting low frequency
electromagnetic waves.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Even when the DNA was kept
in separate test tubes,

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
the professor still recorded
electromagnetic communication

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
How sophisticated could
this communication be?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, Luc Montagnier
showed they are

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
able to organize nucleotides,
the ingredients which actually

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:90%
make up DNA into brand new DNA.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Scientists combined these
ingredients countless times

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.370 align:middle line:84%
before but in no experiment have
they have been able to recreate

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
the spark of life and transform
nucleotides into actual DNA,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:84%
not without DNA
already being present.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Life, after all, can only exist
where life has existed before.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But in Luc Montagnier's
experiments,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
the DNA had been completely
filtered from the water

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.639 align:middle line:90%
yet new DNA was still found.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Just how was this possible?

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
How had Luc Montagnier
managed to achieve what

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
no other scientist
could and create

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:90%
life where no life was present?

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.224 align:middle line:84%
What was so different about
Luc Montagnier's experiments?

00:12:28.224 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
There was the presence of a
frequency, a frequency which

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:84%
when removed would cause
the experiments to fail,

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
but when present would ensure
that they would succeed.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
That frequency was 7.83
Hertz, Schumann resonance.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
A delicate relationship
had been struck

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
between life and the
frequency of the planet,

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
an interaction of
living organisms

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic
frequencies, a reliance, a bond.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of this can be found
by reading the science papers,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
but more obvious
proof can be found

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
by simply walking outside.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:90%
How did all this happen?

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at
the history of the Earth

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:90%
it seems pretty obvious.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Schumann waves have
been part of this planet

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:90%
since the very beginning.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Life evolves surrounded by
them and inevitably tuned in.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our
sensitivity to frequency

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:84%
became deeply connected to
our ability to sense another

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:90%
of the planet's phenomena.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:14:05.648 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.648 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Two billion years ago
magnetotatic bacteria

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
formed a simple but intriguing
relationship with the Earth's

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:90%
magnetic fields.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The single-celled
organism contained

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:90%
particles of magnetic material.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
This enabled it to act like
the needle of a compass

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.306 align:middle line:84%
and orient along the
magnetic lines of the Earth.

00:14:25.306 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
As organisms became
more complex,

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:84%
so did their reliance on
the Earth's magnetic fields.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
We do know that bees are
sensitive to magnetic fields.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We know that within
their bodies they

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
contain particles of Earth
magnetite and laboratory

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.130 align:middle line:84%
studies have shown
that they are indeed

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:90%
sensitive to magnetic fields.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:10%
And you can demonstrate
in laboratory

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:10%
that if you artificially
create a magnetic field,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:10%
you can control the way
that they build their cone

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:10%
and it seems logical
that bees are using

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:10%
magnetic fields in navigation.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: - The delicate
balance of life on Earth

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:84%
is perfectly illustrated
by reliance on bees

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:90%
and their pollination of plants.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It's hypothesized that
without bees life wouldn't

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:90%
stand much of a chance.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Insect pollination is needed
for really all the things

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:43.005 align:middle line:84%
that make eating interesting,
so all the fruits, the nuts,

00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and things like that all
require insect pollination

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.065 align:middle line:84%
and bees are the most
important group of pollinators.

00:15:49.065 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.571 align:middle line:10%
If the bees weren't here,
we'd have a very boring planet.

00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
We would have a
very thin existence,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the point
without bees and of course,

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
as well as the food
that way need to eat,

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
they're pollinating
wild plants as well.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, we don't
know details about pollination

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.870 align:middle line:84%
of wild plants
but we can be sure

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that without bees to pollinate
then many of our wild plants

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.659 align:middle line:90%
will disappear.

00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:45.263 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.263 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
RADIO HOST (ON RADIO): We
are with Marianne Frazier,

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
the senior extension associate
for beekeeping at Pennsylvania

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:90%
State University.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:10%
What are the classic criteria
of colony collapse disorder

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:10%
so that any beekeeper can go
out there and look at their bees

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.327 align:middle line:10%
and say, this looks like a
pretty classic case of this?

00:17:03.327 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:10%
MARYANN FRAZIER (ON
RADIO): The symptoms

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:10%
are that the bees are
relatively healthy and strong

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:10%
and in a very short
period of time,

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:10%
the adult bee population
disappears from the colony.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It leaves the colony.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And what it leaves
behind is a lot of brood,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.374 align:middle line:84%
meaning the young
bees, honey and pollen.

00:17:23.374 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:10%
RADIO HOST (ON RADIO):
On what continents

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:10%
has this colony collapse
disorder been observed?

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
MARYANN FRAZIER (ON RADIO):
Well the decline of honeybees

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:90%
has occurred actually worldwide.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We've seen many other countries
report declines in honeybees,

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it's truly due
to this thing called colony

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:50.048 align:middle line:84%
collapse disorder, which is a
pretty unique set of criteria

00:17:50.048 --> 00:17:51.107 align:middle line:90%
is another question.

00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things we're

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand by
trying to communicate

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
with other people in
other parts of the world.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:10%
This sort of current
concern particularly

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:10%
dates from about
2006 and particularly

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:10%
in the United States where a
lot of commercial bee keepers

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:10%
suddenly found that their
bees had been healthy

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:10%
at one point in the year
and then in late summer

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:10%
just suffered these
spectacular losses.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And they appeared to be
different from anything

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:90%
that had been seen before.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So people were just
going to their hives

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.015 align:middle line:84%
and finding there
were no bees at all.

00:18:24.015 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Colony collapse
disorder has affected hives

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
with some countries

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
reporting losses of up to 70%.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:10%
A variety of reasons have
been offered as to its cause,

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:10%
but none of them have been
able to conclusively explain

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:10%
why all of a sudden bees
don't return to the hives,

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:10%
apart from one, a
sensational piece of research

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:10%
by Joseph Kuhn and his team.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:84%
In an experiment, the doctor
worked with eight beehives

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and placed a regular home deck
phone inside half of them.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
The scientists then monitored
if the presence of a deck phone

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:84%
would affect the way that
bees return to their hive.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.555 align:middle line:90%
The results were astonishing.

00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
In the hives where no
deck phone was present,

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
the bees returned
at a normal rate,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
but in the hives which
contained a deck phone,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:90%
the bees hardly returned at all.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:10%
In one hive containing
a deck phone,

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:10%
not a single bee returned.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
To fully understand
the relevance

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
of Dr. Kuhn's experiment,
we must first understand

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:90%
how a deck phone works.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:84%
The reason you are able
to walk around your home

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
talking on your deck phone
is because the base station

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of the direct phone sends
electromagnetic frequency

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.764 align:middle line:84%
waves called microwaves
to the handset.

00:19:45.764 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly the same
way that a mobile phone

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.190 align:middle line:84%
mast communicates
with a mobile phone.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:84%
A deck phone is basically
a miniature version

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.725 align:middle line:90%
of a mobile phone mast.

00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
If a bee is affected by what
comes out of a deck phone,

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
it will most definitely
be affected by what comes

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:90%
out of a mobile phone mast.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And with four billion mobile
phone users around the world,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden there
are an awful lot

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:90%
of mobile phone masts.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The bee's magnetic
sense allows it

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to navigate using the magnetic
lines of the Earth, an ability

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
it has spent millions of years
you fine tuning and developing.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Does it stand to reason then
that such an acute sensitivity

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
will be affected by
even the slightest

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:84%
change in the
electromagnetic environment?

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So what about a gargantuan
change and one which

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.725 align:middle line:90%
has happened almost overnight?

00:21:09.725 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Are there other species
that have this sensitivity

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:84%
to magnetic fields,
a sensitivity

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.805 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately makes
them vulnerable to man-made

00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:23.504 align:middle line:90%
frequencies?

00:21:23.504 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the discovery
of a new protein cell

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
called a cryptochrome suggests
all life has a magnetic sense.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They were discovered
in the 1990s in plants

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
where their function is to
absorb blue light, which

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:90%
is used to regulate growth.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
They were since been found
in insects, animals, mammals,

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:90%
including humans and in birds.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:10%
Cryptochromes are a biological
molecule called a protein.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:10%
It's generated by some of
your genes called cry genes

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:10%
and the cryptochrome
molecule actually

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.640 align:middle line:10%
controls your circadian
rhythms including

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:10%
melatonin productions.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.075 align:middle line:84%
Some of the cryptochrome seem
to have a function of absorbing

00:22:24.075 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
the light as detectors
for the circadian clock,

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
so they are inputs for
the light-dark cycle

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.715 align:middle line:84%
that many species seem to have,
plants as well as animals.

00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: But in the
year 2000, Thorsten Ritz

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:10%
demonstrated an
even more amazing

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:10%
role for the cryptochrome.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
In a series of
experiments on Robbins,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:84%
he demonstrated that their
navigational sense was not only

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:84%
a magnetic one, but
it came directly

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:84%
from the cryptochrome
cells, which

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:90%
are located behind the eye.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:10%
I think the Ritz
paper published in 2000

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:10%
is one of those
milestones in science

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:10%
because he proposed that this
cryptochrome molecule, which,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:10%
remember, is best known for its
effect in controlling circadian

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:10%
rhythms, that that
molecule was actually

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:10%
responsible for giving
the magnetic compass

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.535 align:middle line:10%
information in birds.

00:23:24.535 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The birds literally see
the Earth's magnetic field

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
perhaps as a bright or
dark spot superimposed

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:90%
on their field of vision.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Then as they then move their
head or their body around,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.070 align:middle line:84%
the spot moves and so rather
like a heads-up display

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:90%
for a fighter pilot.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They have this thing that
they see, goodness knows

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:84%
what it would be,
which allows them

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:90%
to orient while they're flying.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:84%
The way he tested that was to
expose birds to radio frequency

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:84%
fields to see if it
actually disturbed

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
their magnetic compass and not
only did the radio frequency

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
field indeed disrupt the
migration of Robbins,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
but it did so at very, very
low intensities of fields

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.745 align:middle line:84%
and that's really important
and really interesting,

00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that very low level radio
frequency fields interfered

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:90%
with the Robbin's compass.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: The experiments
by Ritz clearly demonstrated

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:10%
that the cryptochrome
cell used in navigation

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.830 align:middle line:10%
was seriously affected
by man-made frequencies

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:10%
and man-made frequencies levels
well below those deemed safe

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:10%
by the governing body ICNIRP.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:10%
All of the animal
navigation studies,

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:10%
the cockroaches, the zebra
finches, the chickens,

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:10%
the Robbins, they've all
had their magnetic compass

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:10%
disturbed by radio
frequency fields

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:10%
well below the ICNIRP
public exposure limit.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I work on birds, particularly
birds and insects.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:10%
I have shown that they
are sensitive to fields

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:10%
way below the ICNIRP levels
that claim are safe for us.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:10%
If you look at where
the research shows

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:10%
they are sensitive to, there's
good stuff in the literature

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.127 align:middle line:10%
showing it's significantly lower
than what we are allowed to be

00:25:19.127 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:10%
exposed to and
therefore what they're

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:10%
exposed to in the environment.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
There's certainly
solid scientific reason

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
for supposing that
magnetic fields,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
artificial magnetic fields,
will disturb the habitat

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.185 align:middle line:90%
of a number of species.

00:25:33.185 --> 00:26:49.696 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.696 --> 00:26:51.480 align:middle line:84%
How much has our
environment changed

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
because of electromagnetic
fields because of--

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 25 years, it's
a changed beyond recognition,

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:90%
just beyond recognition.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:84%
It's millions and
millions of times in terms

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic energy.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:10%
The former National
Radiological Protection Board,

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:10%
in one of their documents,
said that they thought

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:10%
that the radiation environment,
if you like to call it that,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:10%
had increased many millions of
times from what it was 50 years

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:10%
ago, many millions of times.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It's an enormous change
in environment on Earth,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, completely swamped
all these natural signals,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.757 align:middle line:84%
including the Schumann waves
that we have evolved with.

00:27:27.757 --> 00:27:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that
cryptochromes are particularly

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
interesting from the point of
view of human being detecting

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:84%
magnetic fields is that there's
a recent study by Dr. Foley

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and colleagues showing that
if you put human cryptochromes

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
into the fruit fly, then the
fruit fly is made particularly

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:84%
sensitive because
of the presence

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of these human cryptochromes.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually showing
that human cryptochromes

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:90%
are magnetically sensitive.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.672 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they detect
magnetic fields.

00:28:21.672 --> 00:28:26.506 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The discovery
of the cryptochrome cell

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
has sparked new interest in the
magnetic sense of man, a sense

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that Robin Baker had
predicted some 40 years ago.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR (ON TV):
This is not some kind

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.230 align:middle line:90%
of scientific blind man's bluff.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's an experiment to
find out whether children

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.420 align:middle line:90%
have a sense of direction.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Blindfolded and ear
muffed, the subject

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:84%
is turned around
in a special chair

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:84%
until he can't remember
which direction he's facing.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:84%
The chair stops and the subject
guesses whether he's facing

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:90%
east, west, north or south.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
The guest is recorded
in a small computer.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:84%
If children have no
sense of direction,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:90%
their guesses would be random.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Children after the
age of about 10 or 11

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:90%
make pretty good guesses.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:84%
It seems they have a
real sense of direction

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to be
a magnetic sense.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
When the scientist struck a
magnet to the subject's head,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
it disrupts his sense
of direction severely.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge
advance in understanding.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:90%
It begs all sorts of questions.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It begs questions of
whether human beings

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.450 align:middle line:84%
can actually navigate in
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Even though they don't
do it today, did they

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
do it thousands of years ago.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it begs the
question as to whether this was

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
a process by which magnetic
fields are actually detected

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:84%
in the human body, which
leads to this disturbance

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of circadian rhythms which would
explain all the diverse health

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:84%
effects that we see so much else
in the epidemiological studies

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.289 align:middle line:90%
of health in magnetic fields.

00:29:59.289 --> 00:30:03.546 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.546 --> 00:30:05.470 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: If mankind
has the ability

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:84%
to sense magnetic
fields, the same ability

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:84%
as the bees, the birds,
and the butterflies,

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:84%
does that also mean that we
are as vulnerable as they

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.830 align:middle line:90%
are to man-made frequencies?

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Will changes in our
environment affect us

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.722 align:middle line:90%
as it's clearly affecting them?

00:30:25.722 --> 00:30:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.305 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: So how would
describe electrosensitivity?

00:30:38.305 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Electrical sensitivity is
when people start reacting,

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:84%
their body starts reacting
to electromagnetic fields.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:10%
Generally speaking, the
electromagnetic fields

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:10%
that they'll be
reacting to is wireless.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:10%
So it will be wireless
communications.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:90%
It will be Wi-Fi.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:04.600 align:middle line:84%
It will be cordless phones, deck
phones, mobile phones, masts,

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:84%
all of them emitting
signals that our body

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.537 align:middle line:90%
has never experienced before.

00:31:11.537 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And when people start to become
affected, the way I became

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
infected, the way that
it starts to affect you

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
is generally speaking
it's your head first

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and it will start giving
you pains in your head.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I hate to use the word headache
because it's pains in your head

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
that is unlike
any other headache

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.146 align:middle line:90%
you've ever had before.

00:31:35.146 --> 00:31:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.770 align:middle line:10%
Most people's complaints are
things like cardiac arrhythmia,

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:10%
insomnia, headache, visual
disturbance, vertigo,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:10%
different kinds of
paresthesias or neurasthenias

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:10%
where they are feeling unusual
sensations within their body.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
But really it can also
affect endocrine function,

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
thyroid function, again,
the list is really endless.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:84%
In my particular case, and
this is not everybody's case,

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.830 align:middle line:84%
if I then don't get
out of the environment,

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I start getting quite
severe pains in my gut

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and that will then
mean it's too late.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I will then start
bleeding internally.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
symptoms are so diverse

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and the associations
that people make

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
are very difficult
to accept if you have

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:84%
no knowledge of
this subject, which

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
most physicians do not have and
that's no fault of their own.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:84%
We're not trained to
recognize this condition.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It's very innovative and
our understanding of it

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
is entirely embryonic
at this stage.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:84%
We're at the very first
steps of unraveling and fully

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:90%
understanding this condition.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Brian,
like many sufferers

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
of electrosensitivity,
has been forced to make

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.748 align:middle line:90%
radical changes to his home.

00:33:00.748 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:84%
The area of these two
rooms have been completely

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:84%
shielded in metal foil so
that this room and the bedroom

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:90%
are a Faraday cage.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually check
the electromagnetic fields

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:84%
or the microwave, and this
machine is simply converting

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:36.360 align:middle line:84%
microwaves to no use, you
find that the mast that's was

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.240 align:middle line:84%
about half a mile away
over there, which causes me

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:84%
a problem, by shielding the room
and putting metalized glass,

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.410 align:middle line:84%
means that I can eliminate most
of the electromagnetic fields.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
The aspects of an organism that
allow it to detect and respond

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to electromagnetic fields, you
could say this way it's going

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:84%
to use a number of
different contacts

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and if you bisect it and
break it down, electrically

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:84%
sensitive, you could
say that really that's

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.550 align:middle line:84%
a response to life
itself in that,

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.929 align:middle line:84%
for example, if we are
looking at an organism

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:19.350 align:middle line:84%
to determine the
presence of life,

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:84%
we're really looking for
the presence of electricity.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.639 align:middle line:84%
So with the electrocardiogram,
for example, the ECG

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:84%
and the electroencephalogram,
the EEG,

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.469 align:middle line:84%
what we're looking at
there is the presence

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.780 align:middle line:84%
of electricity from
those target organs,

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:90%
the brain and the heart.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.179 align:middle line:84%
And when we see the
presence of that,

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that's a sign that
there is life.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:10%
So in a way, given that
on a cellular level,

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic
fields, a part of life

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:middle line:10%
itself, we could
say that all life is

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.700 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetically sensitive.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Desperate to convince
people that electrosensitivity

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
was genuine, Brian and a
number of other sufferers

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.560 align:middle line:84%
signed up to a landmark
experiment at Essex University.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.250 align:middle line:84%
The experiment,
run by Elaine Fox,

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.878 align:middle line:84%
would suddenly become the
definitive work on the subject.

00:35:05.878 --> 00:35:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to go
into a shielded room

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and you go in there for a
relatively short period of time

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and the mast is on for 10
minutes and off for 10 minutes

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and on for 10 minutes and
to see whether you can

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:90%
detect whether it's on or not.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the
room having told them

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that I would not be able to
tell them whether the mast was

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.670 align:middle line:90%
on or off or on.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.080 align:middle line:90%
INTERVIEWER: Why's that?

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Because their understanding of
how you react to this is wrong.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.130 align:middle line:84%
This is not a case
with most people

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:84%
where you turn the mast
on and oh, I'm affected.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They turn the mast
off, oh, I'm OK again.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I suffer with hay fever
and when I go into a field

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:84%
where there is pollen,
it takes a while

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.490 align:middle line:84%
before I'll be affected,
but it takes a long time

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:90%
before I'm not affected.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I can be removed from the
hay field for 24 hours,

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.960 align:middle line:84%
but I'll still be
feeling my hay fever

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and electrical sensitivity
with most people

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:12.952 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit like that.

00:36:12.952 --> 00:36:15.700 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The way the team had
sets up the experiment meant

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:84%
it would be almost
impossible for Brian

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and the other volunteers to
prove they were being affected,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:84%
not that it would
matter as the team had

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:84%
inexplicably decided to do
away with any form of vetting

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.440 align:middle line:90%
procedure.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
For one thing,
people appear to be

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:90%
sensitive to different things.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm sensitive to
3G mobile phones.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm sensitive to
GSM mobile phones.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:40.210 align:middle line:10%
For example, there are
differences in the way

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:10%
the modulation works.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:10%
I have no idea whether they're
right in their sensitivities,

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:10%
but if that is the case,
then it makes sense

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:10%
that the people who you've
gotten into your study

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.360 align:middle line:10%
claim to be sensitive
to exactly the signal

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to
be exposing them to.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:84%
If you have someone that,
for example, is always

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to Wi-Fi
but they're never

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.284 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to mobile
phones, if they exist,

00:36:59.284 --> 00:37:01.050 align:middle line:84%
then you make sure that what
they're being exposed to

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.087 align:middle line:84%
is Wi-Fi and not mobile
phones because you're actually

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:84%
trying to prove whether
they're sensitive to what

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.740 align:middle line:90%
they're saying there are.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.560 align:middle line:84%
None of that
differentiation was done.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It was really if you claim
to be sensitive to anything

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:84%
at all that happened to be
electromagnetic, you were in.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the reasons why I
thought it was quite important

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:10%
was I help people who are
electrically sensitive

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.240 align:middle line:10%
and a couple of months before
I'd actually been to a lady's

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:10%
house who thought she was
electrically sensitive just

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:10%
to try and help her
and to explain to her

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:10%
what electrical
sensitivity was and what

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:10%
might be causing her problem.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story
short, it was obvious

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that this particular
lady had a problem

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.610 align:middle line:84%
but she was not
electrically sensitive.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.980 align:middle line:84%
She was definitely not
electrically sensitive.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But in the going of
the conversation,

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.180 align:middle line:84%
she'd signed up for
the Essex trials

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:84%
to try and find out whether
she was electrically sensitive.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.345 align:middle line:90%
Well, my heart missed a beat.

00:37:55.345 --> 00:37:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's somebody that's
not electrically sensitive

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and they've signed up to go to
Essex and Essex are telling me

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
they don't have a
vetting procedure.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.830 align:middle line:84%
What they actually
found-- and this

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:84%
is based on the text
in the paper itself,

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sort of paraphrasing--
is they needed, according

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:84%
to them, with the level of
response they were expecting

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to see from sensitive
people, they

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.190 align:middle line:84%
would need about 132
people, participants

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.530 align:middle line:84%
in their study to
show a statistically

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:90%
significant effect.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how much population,
if you like, they would need.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.890 align:middle line:84%
That's how much data they would
need in their study findings

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:84%
before they could say,
this group is clearly

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:90%
more sensitive than that group.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:90%
What they got was 44.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So from the very
outset, they only

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.310 align:middle line:84%
had a third of the data they
expected that they would

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.760 align:middle line:90%
need to find anything anyway.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:84%
What they ended up finding
was a near statistically

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:90%
significant risk in a way.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:84%
The people who claimed
to be sensitive

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
showed that they were
sensitive with a significance

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:90%
of about 90%.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So the borderline at
which a scientific paper

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:84%
says, yes, this is statistically
significant is 95%.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.750 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get that
level of certainty,

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.540 align:middle line:84%
it's not a statistical
finding at all.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It could be random
chance and noise.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:84%
They got something which was
90% certainty of an increase

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:84%
in risk and of course, it fails
the magic bar at which you can

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.840 align:middle line:84%
call it a statistically
significant result

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was written
off as a, this

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.310 align:middle line:84%
demonstrates that people
aren't sensitive when

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.683 align:middle line:90%
actually it did no such thing.

00:39:14.683 --> 00:39:19.234 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.234 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The constant
exposure to the mast

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:25.650 align:middle line:84%
took its toll on a number of the
volunteers, making some of them

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:84%
so sick they were forced to
withdraw from the experiment.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.510 align:middle line:84%
For Brian, the effects
of the experiment

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:84%
will be felt long
after he left Essex.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.030 align:middle line:84%
My first colonoscopy
was seven years ago.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.780 align:middle line:84%
My second one was
four years ago.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.531 align:middle line:84%
The third one was
about a year ago.

00:39:43.531 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
the matter with me.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
the matter with me.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:90%
You're imagining it.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I've got colon cancer.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So from the first time that I
bled till the time of removing

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.500 align:middle line:90%
the polyp was seven years.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.900 align:middle line:84%
When I asked the
doctor how long does

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:06.690 align:middle line:84%
it take to cancer to
develop, seven years.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can virtually track
the time when I went to Essex

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and there was one
occasion before where

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.970 align:middle line:90%
I started bleeding.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.025 align:middle line:84%
With that bleeding has
caused me colon cancer.

00:40:18.025 --> 00:40:21.485 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:23.840 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: How could such
a botched experiment

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:84%
be held up as such a
definitive piece of research?

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Why would such an
experienced team

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:84%
make such fundamental and
obvious errors in their work?

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%


00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.253 align:middle line:84%
Could it be anything to do with
those who provided the funding?

00:40:38.253 --> 00:40:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:84%
The Essex experiment is one of
a number of experiments funded

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:84%
by the MTHR, a company
set up and funded

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.730 align:middle line:84%
by the mobile
industry themselves.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.150 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: Could you
explain what MTHR does

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and how MTHR is funded?
-Yes.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:84%
The MTHR program is funded
jointly by the UK government

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and the mobile
telecommunications industry

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and it funds research into
possible adverse health

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.970 align:middle line:84%
effects related to
mobile phone technology.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.490 align:middle line:10%
The whole issue of who
funds scientific research

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.370 align:middle line:10%
is a thorny issue.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:10%
I know many
scientists like myself

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:10%
who when they get a
new study to read,

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.540 align:middle line:10%
the first thing they turn
to is the back of the page

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.062 align:middle line:10%
where it says who funded it.

00:41:37.062 --> 00:41:38.880 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: Is
there, do you think,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe a conflict of
interest in the mobile phone

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.620 align:middle line:84%
industry funding research
into the harm that it does?

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course there is a
potential conflict of interest

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's why a program
of funding like this

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:90%
has to be carefully managed.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.500 align:middle line:10%
I've done a lot of work with
the telecommuters industry

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.800 align:middle line:10%
because I organize a
communication workers

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.050 align:middle line:10%
representation in here, and
so I've talked to these people

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.150 align:middle line:10%
for a long time.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:10%
I think they would
like to be objective,

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.790 align:middle line:10%
but they are driven particularly
in a market were they're

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:10%
fighting each other for
market share by profit

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.310 align:middle line:10%
and therefore they
may fund research,

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:10%
but they're much likely like
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.180 align:middle line:10%
you often find that
they are hiring

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:10%
people who've already spoken
on their side of the argument.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.437 align:middle line:90%
Scientists aren't pop stars.

00:42:25.437 --> 00:42:26.470 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a lot of money.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:90%
They have houses to finance.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.270 align:middle line:84%
They have families
to look after.

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Who can blame them for
recognizing that if they find

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:84%
the wrong results, they're
not going to get another job,

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.260 align:middle line:90%
from that source at any rate.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:10%
There are psychological
pressures even in the absence

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.670 align:middle line:10%
of actual pressures,
which may or may not

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.610 align:middle line:10%
be present in individual
circumstances.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:10%
There are clearly
psychological pressures

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:55.690 align:middle line:10%
to conform and to
please the organization

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:56.730 align:middle line:10%
providing your funding.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.460 align:middle line:90%
INTERVIEWER: You feel obliged.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:90%
You feel obliged.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.080 align:middle line:90%
You feel obliged.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.510 align:middle line:84%
There are some really
solid statistics

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:84%
showing that where
there is an issue over

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic field effects.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.830 align:middle line:84%
The study is funded
by the utilities

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.100 align:middle line:84%
or by the power industry
or the radio industry

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:22.310 align:middle line:84%
or by the mobile phone
industry are funded by them,

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.960 align:middle line:84%
the studies tend to be
significantly negative,

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:84%
whereas the studies
funded independently

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:32.207 align:middle line:84%
within universities, and
so on tend not to be so.

00:43:32.207 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a challenging area
in which to research.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.602 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to do
studies of that sort.

00:43:41.602 --> 00:43:44.590 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Because of the constraints
of doing research

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:50.780 align:middle line:84%
in human subjects,
you're not going to have

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.484 align:middle line:90%
perfect research studies.

00:43:52.484 --> 00:43:53.850 align:middle line:84%
There are always going
to be limitations.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Is this a real condition?
Yes.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.620 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, it is.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.660 align:middle line:10%
At present, the World Health
Organization statements

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.040 align:middle line:10%
regarding this are
that it is real

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.920 align:middle line:10%
and symptoms can be
severe and disabling.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.170 align:middle line:84%
The figures for electromagnetic
hypersensitivity

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.260 align:middle line:90%
are around 2% to 3%.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are people who've had
their life extremely affected

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:19.900 align:middle line:90%
by this condition.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But as I've previously
mentioned, on a cellular level

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.970 align:middle line:90%
100% of people are reacting.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
That means that the health care
consequences of not taking this

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.980 align:middle line:84%
seriously, not recognizing
it are potentially huge

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and the numbers of
people that have mild

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.110 align:middle line:84%
to moderate
electrical sensitivity

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.680 align:middle line:84%
are probably far higher
than we estimate.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:51.372 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.372 --> 00:44:57.290 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: So where
does all that leave us?

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It leaves us with a tape
recording of an experiment

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.240 align:middle line:84%
to link up between
a standard telephone

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:90%
and a unique mobile handset.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.890 align:middle line:90%
A dialing tone.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's quite an
achievement because it's

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
one thing to transmit
a conversation,

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.260 align:middle line:84%
it's another to transmit
accurate digital information.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, an extension
at the Research

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Institute in Chelmsford, which
has perfected this technique.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.675 align:middle line:84%
On the other end of this
should be Liz Charnock.

00:45:25.675 --> 00:45:28.840 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: With the advent of
the mobile phone in the 1980's

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:84%
came the need to build a network
of antennas to support them.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Since then the telecom
companies have erected over

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.350 align:middle line:84%
five million mobile phone
masts around the world,

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:84%
but incredibly, prior to
filling the air with microwave

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.980 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, they didn't conduct
a single piece of research

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to ensure there wouldn't
be any long-term health

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:51.470 align:middle line:90%
effects from such exposure.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The grid was built without
first making sure it was safe.

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your help.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.570 align:middle line:90%
LIZ CHARNOCK: Hello.

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:12.465 align:middle line:90%


00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:16.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty ugly, isn't it?

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's constant as well.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.130 align:middle line:84%
One thing you'll notice
is it doesn't stop.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.550 align:middle line:90%
It's 24/7.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what's coming
out of the mast.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.140 align:middle line:84%
If you can see the mast,
you're being exposed to it.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, even if
you can't, you're

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.360 align:middle line:84%
being exposed to it if
you're this distance

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.214 align:middle line:84%
away because it will pass
through concrete walls

00:46:31.214 --> 00:46:32.038 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:46:32.038 --> 00:46:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It will dampen it a
bit, but not very much.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're within 200, 300
meters of the mast up there,

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.550 align:middle line:84%
this is what you're going
to be exposed to 24/7.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:41.091 align:middle line:84%
When you can hear it,
it changes everything.

00:46:41.091 --> 00:46:43.670 align:middle line:84%
-It does.
-Imagine if you could see it.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:50.500 align:middle line:84%
It would be the equivalent
of seeing a daily smog.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:47:01.826 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.826 --> 00:47:05.486 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: With the constant
smog of man-made frequencies

00:47:05.486 --> 00:47:09.650 align:middle line:84%
surrounding our daily lives and
no testing as to its safety,

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:14.570 align:middle line:84%
is there any wonder people's
bodies have started react?

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it almost
10 years ago when

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 30s, no history
of breast cancer in my family

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and living a really
healthy lifestyle,

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd been living
next to a phone mast

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:29.541 align:middle line:84%
for many years, over
seven years by then.

00:47:29.541 --> 00:47:30.740 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: How
far was that from--

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.319 align:middle line:84%
It was a 100 meters
from the house.

00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:33.620 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: All right.
So pretty close.

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:34.319 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:37.740 align:middle line:10%
And for years I've been having
symptoms, which I hadn't

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:10%
related to the phone mast
because I didn't know anything

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.220 align:middle line:10%
about the condition of
electrosensitivity then

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:47.350 align:middle line:10%
and I've been having vertigo,
sleep problems, headaches,

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.290 align:middle line:10%
sharp pains in my head.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:51.890 align:middle line:10%
And I'd often visit the
doctor only to be told it

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.480 align:middle line:10%
was either stress or a virus.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And then just out
of the blue, I was

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.880 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with breast
cancer and it was

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.310 align:middle line:90%
the biggest shock of my life.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:06.110 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And at first I thought,
well, it's bad luck.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just unlucky
it's me and started

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to go through my
treatment and it was then

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I started bumping into
neighbors in the hospital.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And I only lived
in a small village

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and started to bump
into other young ladies

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.796 align:middle line:84%
as well who were neighbors.
INTERVIEWER: Young?

00:48:23.796 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:90%
How old?

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was the
youngest in my 30s,

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.857 align:middle line:84%
but the others were in
the 40s or early 50s.

00:48:28.857 --> 00:48:29.890 align:middle line:90%
INTERVIEWER: That's very young.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.240 align:middle line:10%
And that was five
of us all diagnosed

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:38.032 align:middle line:10%
at once within six months of
each other with breast cancer.

00:48:38.032 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: There were only
18 houses in the village

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.620 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the phone
mast, so Eileen decided

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to conduct a survey to see
if anybody else had suddenly

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.420 align:middle line:90%
started suffering ill health.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.970 align:middle line:84%
What came back
really frightened us.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people were reporting
the same symptoms that I'd

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.047 align:middle line:90%
been suffering for years.

00:48:55.047 --> 00:48:56.181 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: The vertigo?
-Yeah.

00:48:56.181 --> 00:48:57.670 align:middle line:84%
The headaches.
The vertigo.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But there was other young women
in the village who were having

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.400 align:middle line:84%
fertility problems and
precancerous cervical cells,

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.040 align:middle line:84%
other young ladies
who tied breast

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.690 align:middle line:84%
cancer, benign lumps, or
the conditions of cancer

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.190 align:middle line:90%
as well in the area.

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
One of our neighbors
who was only 51

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.810 align:middle line:84%
had developed motor
neuron disease

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.630 align:middle line:90%
and he unfortunately died.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:23.176 align:middle line:84%
And so we unearthed an
horrendous can of worms.

00:49:23.176 --> 00:49:27.480 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.490 align:middle line:84%
We've done a count of
77 people in the houses.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And out of 77 houses,
how many people?

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:84%
were suffering
biological effects?

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.720 align:middle line:90%
The estimates was around 70%.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.900 align:middle line:90%
70% of people?

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.730 align:middle line:84%
 --who had effects over the
years with biological effects,

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:47.430 align:middle line:84%
sleep problems, skin rashes,
benign lumps, or cancer.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it had a big impact
on people in the village.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.190 align:middle line:10%
I think this is a
global, massive problem.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:84%
We found since then that
we were not the only cancer

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:middle line:90%
cluster around a phone mast.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.910 align:middle line:84%
There are many cancer
clusters around phone masts

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and we've worked with a local
scientist where we looked

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.170 align:middle line:84%
at the phone masts that have
been in areas for a long time

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and conducted all
the surveys and found

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.240 align:middle line:90%
other cancer clusters as well.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:25.569 align:middle line:90%


00:50:25.569 --> 00:50:29.130 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: With so many phones
and masts and a mobile phone

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.240 align:middle line:84%
industry worth
trillions, you will

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.990 align:middle line:84%
hope that by now a strict
governing body would have been

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:37.610 align:middle line:84%
installed, a iron-fisted
regulator who ensures

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:42.330 align:middle line:84%
the telecoms industry airs
on the side of caution,

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.460 align:middle line:84%
someone to set strict
levels which protect

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.350 align:middle line:84%
the public, someone to
ensure that what we're being

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:52.900 align:middle line:90%
exposed to is absolutely safe.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
don't have any of that.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.085 align:middle line:90%
What we do have is ICNIRP.

00:50:59.085 --> 00:51:01.700 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, ICNIRP was
set up in Europe

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.580 align:middle line:10%
about 20 odd years ago to look
into non-ionizing radiation.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It stands for International
Committee of Non-ionizing

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Radiation Protection
and their job

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.060 align:middle line:84%
is to look at all the
literature that comes out

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and basically summarize
it, say this is what

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.280 align:middle line:90%
the science definitely says.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't get
elected to it, you

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.280 align:middle line:84%
get invited to join it if you're
one of the preferred people.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's always on
the side of industry

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.330 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
where its roots are.

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So what we've got is, we've
got a guidance standard which

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.890 align:middle line:84%
they've set, which has
been adopted by most

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.760 align:middle line:84%
of the countries in Europe
and it's been something

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that the European Commission
themselves recommend, including

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.450 align:middle line:84%
their expert [INAUDIBLE], but
those guidelines are based

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:46.900 align:middle line:84%
on evidence that we know
has a cause and effect

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.210 align:middle line:90%
for radio frequency radiation.

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So the only setting that exists
at the moment, the energy

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.270 align:middle line:84%
that's around the same
frequency of mobile phone,

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:84%
mast mobile phones,
deck cordless phones,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:01.790 align:middle line:84%
was communication devices
that we used on a daily basis

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:84%
is the one that we know
works from microwave ovens.

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
generate enough energy

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and localize it in a small
enough area, you heat things,

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.510 align:middle line:84%
you heat tissue, you
heat anything that

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:15.020 align:middle line:90%
has some level of water in it.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.740 align:middle line:84%
None of the current
rules have anything

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to do with chronic
health effects or cancer,

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.570 align:middle line:90%
none of them, not one of them.

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:26.430 align:middle line:84%
They've all set for heating
effects and acute effects,

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.830 align:middle line:84%
like trickling of the skin
or your eyebrows going out

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.280 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.150 align:middle line:84%
None of them are for
long-term health effects.

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:34.801 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that it's
below 40 that means nothing.

00:52:34.801 --> 00:52:36.060 align:middle line:84%
-Its meaningless.
-It's meaningless.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:36.760 align:middle line:90%
It's meaningless.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It is not intended to protect
from long-term health effects.

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:44.160 align:middle line:90%
ICNIRP is just irrelevant.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.890 align:middle line:90%
It's irrelevant.

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:50.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you want to
make sure that nobody exceeds

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.240 align:middle line:84%
the speed limit
past a school, set

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.360 align:middle line:84%
the speed limit
1,000 miles an hour,

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.830 align:middle line:84%
then everyone will
obey the speed limit.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:02.270 align:middle line:90%
No one will exceed it.

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can go sailing
past your school

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:10.820 align:middle line:84%
at 999 miles an hour and the
limit will be complied with.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The advisory body
effectively are not

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.430 align:middle line:84%
set up to look at the
evidence with regards

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:16.215 align:middle line:84%
to safeguarding
the general public.

00:53:16.215 --> 00:53:18.220 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: So
[INAUDIBLE] a century

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:23.242 align:middle line:84%
there to establish 100% fact and
anything that's not 100% fact

00:53:23.242 --> 00:53:25.400 align:middle line:90%
is not their concern.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.030 align:middle line:84%
That's right they'll
go talk about it,

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.500 align:middle line:84%
they'll summarize
what there is, what

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.961 align:middle line:84%
there isn't, and what's left to
find out, and then that's it.

00:53:30.961 --> 00:53:31.660 align:middle line:90%
They'll leave it.

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.650 align:middle line:84%
There no recommendations,
nothing because they

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:35.494 align:middle line:90%
just don't see it as their job.

00:53:35.494 --> 00:53:48.317 align:middle line:90%


00:53:48.317 --> 00:53:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So what if I try
and make a call?

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Let me try and make a call.

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:51.680 align:middle line:84%
If you try and
make a phone call,

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.120 align:middle line:84%
then it would be almost
constant because it

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.811 align:middle line:84%
starts a proper sort of
two-wave, high bandwidth

00:53:54.811 --> 00:53:55.950 align:middle line:84%
transmission.
-OK.

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's do that.
-Oh, wow.

00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:59.010 align:middle line:90%
So as soon as it picks up--

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:02.421 align:middle line:84%
This is it trying to-- and this
is when someone's [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:02.421 --> 00:54:03.620 align:middle line:84%
This is now what
the phone is doing.

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:07.265 align:middle line:84%
And that's waves going from
my phone to the bay station

00:54:07.265 --> 00:54:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and then being
transmitted from there.

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.606 align:middle line:90%
And that's it's picked up.

00:54:11.606 --> 00:54:12.910 align:middle line:90%
That's horrible.

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically what
your phone is transmitting

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.320 align:middle line:84%
into your head all the time
you've got an operation

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and using the phone.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:38.258 align:middle line:90%


00:54:38.258 --> 00:54:41.030 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: It's hard to
imagine a piece of technology

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:42.930 align:middle line:84%
which has accelerated
into our lives

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.236 align:middle line:90%
quite like the mobile phone.

00:54:44.236 --> 00:54:47.240 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.342 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago, it was seen as
little more than a gimmick.

00:54:50.342 --> 00:54:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:54:54.040 --> 00:55:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Today four billion of us
own one and the average age

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of a child when they
receive their first phone

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:04.869 align:middle line:90%
is just eight years old.

00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:09.090 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The way a mobile phone
works is by sending

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and receiving
microwave frequencies

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.090 align:middle line:90%
to and from the bay station.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So having a phone pressed
against your head inevitably

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:23.900 align:middle line:84%
means your brain is being
exposed to those waves.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Does the brain react
to this exposure?

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:33.890 align:middle line:84%
A recent American study
shows it absolutely does.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:37.540 align:middle line:84%
The work was carried
out by Dr. Nora Volkow.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Volkow and her team
studied 47 healthy people

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.090 align:middle line:90%
for an entire year.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Participants had a cell phone
placed on their left and right

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:84%
ears, one was
activated but muted,

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.660 align:middle line:90%
the other was turned off.

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Volkow used brain
imaging equipment

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to study how much
glucose the brain

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:57.811 align:middle line:90%
would use during exposure.

00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:04.890 align:middle line:10%
So it's a very sensitive
marker to indicate if there are

00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:07.610 align:middle line:10%
changes in brain
activity that may

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:10.720 align:middle line:10%
be driven by a given
stimulus, which in this case

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.030 align:middle line:10%
was the cell phone.

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.796 align:middle line:90%


00:56:14.796 --> 00:56:16.760 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: When the
brain is stimulated,

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:22.270 align:middle line:84%
it consumes glucose in the
same way a car consumes fuel.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:25.750 align:middle line:84%
50-minutes exposure
to a cell phone

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:29.490 align:middle line:84%
was associated with increases
in glucose consumption

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:31.890 align:middle line:84%
by the brain, which
indicates that the brain

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:35.030 align:middle line:84%
was being activated by
the radio frequencies

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.090 align:middle line:90%
from the cell phone.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:37.670 align:middle line:84%
This right area
of the brain that

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:41.000 align:middle line:84%
was very close to the
antenna show the largest

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.700 align:middle line:84%
increases in
metabolism as compare

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.363 align:middle line:90%
when the telephones were off.

00:56:45.363 --> 00:56:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Even though the radio
frequencies that are emitted

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:55.880 align:middle line:84%
from current cell phone
technologies are very weak,

00:56:55.880 --> 00:57:01.042 align:middle line:84%
they are able to activate the
human brain, to have an effect.

00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:03.350 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: By using
a muted cell phone,

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Volkow's experiment showed
that the human brain has

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.010 align:middle line:84%
a metabolic reaction to
the presence of microwaves

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:13.400 align:middle line:84%
from a mobile phone, a
metabolic reaction at levels

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.650 align:middle line:84%
well below the legal limit,
something many people

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.135 align:middle line:90%
claimed was impossible.

00:57:20.135 --> 00:57:24.830 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reaction
recorded by the doctor

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:30.860 align:middle line:84%
is secondary to an even
greater concern, the way

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that those microwaves are
actually absorbed by the brain.

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:38.010 align:middle line:90%
This has become known as SAR.

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:46.820 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.060 align:middle line:10%
SAR is, well, first of all, it
stands for specific absorption

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:10%
rate and that's the measure of
how much RF energy in this case

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.570 align:middle line:10%
radio waves is absorbed
into the human body

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:03.350 align:middle line:10%
over a certain period of
time within a certain volume.

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.620 align:middle line:10%
So it's a measure of
the heating effect

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.180 align:middle line:10%
that a radio transmitter
would have on your body,

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.685 align:middle line:10%
on the human body.

00:58:10.685 --> 00:58:12.420 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The SAR for
every mobile phone

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.610 align:middle line:84%
is measured in this way,
using an artificial head

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:18.160 align:middle line:90%
called a SAM phantom.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.000 align:middle line:84%
This is filled with
a glucose mixture

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.990 align:middle line:90%
which represents the brain.

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:25.630 align:middle line:84%
The probe measures the
amount of microwave radiation

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that penetrates the
SAM phantom skull

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and calculates a
SAR rating based

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.640 align:middle line:90%
on how much energy is absorbed.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:43.120 align:middle line:84%
From the European Union, the
limit is 2 watts per kilogram,

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.890 align:middle line:90%
over 10 gram average of tissue.

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:48.270 align:middle line:84%
For America, it's 1.6
watts per kilogram,

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.420 align:middle line:90%
over a 1 gram average of tissue.

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So the limit for the USA is more
stringent than for the European

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Union, but other
countries around the world

00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:00.482 align:middle line:84%
such as Australia, New Zealand,
use the European limit.

00:59:00.482 --> 00:59:03.140 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Some of the most
popular phones on the market

00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:07.600 align:middle line:84%
emit so much microwave
radiation that the SAR rating is

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.720 align:middle line:90%
right on the edge of the limit.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:21.788 align:middle line:90%


00:59:21.788 --> 00:59:24.873 align:middle line:84%
Every millimeter of skull
helps protect the brain

00:59:24.873 --> 00:59:26.765 align:middle line:84%
against the phone's
microwave radiation

00:59:26.765 --> 00:59:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and therefore lowers
the phone's SAR rating.

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Children get their first
phone at the average age

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:34.930 align:middle line:90%
of eight years old.

00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.380 align:middle line:84%
An eight-year-old skull is
considerably thinner than that

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.750 align:middle line:84%
of an adult. So you would
hope that phones are tested

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:43.738 align:middle line:84%
against the skull which
represents the thickness

00:59:43.738 --> 00:59:45.232 align:middle line:90%
of that of a child.

00:59:45.232 --> 00:59:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The SAM head is an average
shaped and sized human skull.

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.656 align:middle line:84%
The average of 10,000 people
has been taken in terms

00:59:58.656 --> 01:00:00.888 align:middle line:84%
of their head
measurements and this SAM

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:02.840 align:middle line:84%
phantom head has
been created, which

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.280 align:middle line:90%
is an average human skull.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.208 align:middle line:90%


01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:10.220 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Obviously the
head of an average human

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.230 align:middle line:84%
being is considerably
larger than that

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of an eight-year-old child.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.048 align:middle line:90%


01:00:17.048 --> 01:00:19.180 align:middle line:10%
But when we investigated
the company that

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.050 align:middle line:10%
makes the SAM phantom
head, we discovered

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:24.772 align:middle line:10%
that the news is even worse.

01:00:24.772 --> 01:00:27.490 align:middle line:90%


01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
The SAM phantom isn't just
the average of 10,000 people,

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:37.710 align:middle line:84%
it's the average of
10,000 US Army personnel.

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And the US Army
personnel most certainly

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.874 align:middle line:84%
have a larger,
bigger, thicker head

01:00:45.874 --> 01:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%
than the average eight-year-old.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.760 align:middle line:90%


01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty reasonable to assume
that if most mobile phones were

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:56.170 align:middle line:84%
tested against the skull
of an eight-year-old,

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:59.820 align:middle line:90%
they would fail.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: Who is it
that sets the standards?

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
A group of people from a
committee called ICNIRP.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:12.477 align:middle line:90%


01:01:12.477 --> 01:01:16.440 align:middle line:10%
The people who do the
work on mobile phones

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.500 align:middle line:10%
are by and large engineers.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:23.430 align:middle line:10%
They have no idea what is going
on inside the living cell,

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:28.190 align:middle line:10%
but they are
pontificating on this.

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:32.360 align:middle line:10%
They make the assumption that
the only thing that can affect

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.990 align:middle line:10%
the well being of
a living organism

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:40.431 align:middle line:10%
is if it is powerful
enough to heat the tissue.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:43.080 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:49.936 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's like saying we know
if we boil an egg it goes hard.

01:01:49.936 --> 01:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
What they don't know is that
if they don't boil the egg,

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
it turns into a chicken
and haven't the slightest

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
idea how that
happens, but the yet

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.830 align:middle line:90%
they pontificate as if they do.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:09.346 align:middle line:90%


01:02:09.346 --> 01:02:12.240 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: In 2011, the
World Health Organization

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.340 align:middle line:10%
changed the danger rating of
mobile phones re-classing it

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:24.890 align:middle line:10%
as possibly carcinogenic to
humans based on an increased

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:29.600 align:middle line:10%
risk of contracting angioma, the
type of brain tumor associated

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.840 align:middle line:10%
with using a mobile phone.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.138 align:middle line:84%
What was the catalyst for
this abrupt change in status?

01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:38.350 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
There have been countless
studies conducted

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:44.560 align:middle line:84%
into the possible health
effects of mobile phones,

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
some showing an effect,
some showing no effect.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.110 align:middle line:90%


01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:55.690 align:middle line:10%
But the most conclusive
came from Lennart Hardell.

01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
He has overseen the largest
and most comprehensive piece

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
of research ever
conducted combining

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:04.124 align:middle line:84%
his own work with that of
others from around the world.

01:03:04.124 --> 01:03:07.090 align:middle line:90%


01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
From the early 1990s, they have
investigated the phone habits

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of more than 2,000 people
from around the world, people

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:20.960 align:middle line:84%
with tumors such as astrocytoma
and acoustic neuroma.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
The brain tumors associated
most with mobile phone

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
use due to their
proximity to the air.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.372 align:middle line:90%
Their findings are shocking.

01:03:30.372 --> 01:03:33.270 align:middle line:90%


01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
They concluded that mobile
phone use does increase

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
the risk of a brain
tumor and they also

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:45.734 align:middle line:84%
discovered why earlier
research showed no effect.

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:55.580 align:middle line:90%


01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there's more
evidence that it's

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
carcinogenic than just
possibly carcinogenic,

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
but I can understand it
in a way because most

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
of the cancers which will
arrive haven't arrived yet.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
People haven't been
using cell phones

01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:21.658 align:middle line:84%
for long enough for the true
effect to become apparent.

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:24.220 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: As is the case
with other carcinogens,

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.720 align:middle line:84%
it takes at least 10 years
before you start to see

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.570 align:middle line:90%
an effect from the exposure.

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the mobile phone
explosion didn't really

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.450 align:middle line:84%
take hold until the
late 1990s, it's

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
not surprising we
are just starting

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.877 align:middle line:90%
to see the effects right now.

01:04:37.877 --> 01:04:41.150 align:middle line:90%


01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
telecoms industry

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
doing to protect its users
from contracting a brain tumor?

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
A flick to the far reaches
of their safety manuals

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
suggests that they
are more concerned

01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:58.400 align:middle line:90%
about protecting themselves.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:26.300 align:middle line:90%


01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.040 align:middle line:10%
At the back of almost
every single phone

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.360 align:middle line:10%
user guide are instructions
on how far to keep your phone

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:44.080 align:middle line:10%
from your body, instructions
which, in the most part,

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:44.993 align:middle line:10%
are wholly unworkable.

01:05:44.993 --> 01:05:50.550 align:middle line:90%


01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:53.090 align:middle line:10%
And what happens when the
telecoms industry funds

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:59.430 align:middle line:10%
research into the harm
that they are causing

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:09.610 align:middle line:10%
and that research concludes that
there is an effect that the use

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.860 align:middle line:10%
of a mobile phone
does play a role

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:19.630 align:middle line:10%
in the development of
cancer, they tend to keep

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:20.630 align:middle line:10%
that research to themselves.

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:25.260 align:middle line:90%


01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know what
we're storing up with the MF

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
because the effects
are largely long term

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and we have as you say
this ubiquitous exposure

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and ubiquitous reliance
on these exposures.

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:47.855 align:middle line:84%
We just don't fully understand
yet what we're doing.

01:06:47.855 --> 01:06:50.775 align:middle line:90%


01:06:50.775 --> 01:06:53.050 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Although the
epidemiology clearly

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.410 align:middle line:10%
shows that using a
mobile phone increases

01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:59.330 align:middle line:10%
the risk of contracting a brain
tumor, what people at ICNIRP

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:03.610 align:middle line:10%
need to see is a definitive
cause and effect, how it

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:07.560 align:middle line:10%
happens, what's
the mechanism, how

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.780 align:middle line:10%
exactly is the cancer caused.

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:16.010 align:middle line:10%
It may seem obvious that a
being so tuned in to the Earth's

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:19.930 align:middle line:10%
frequencies and so sensitive
to her magnetic field

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:22.740 align:middle line:10%
would naturally have a reaction
to man-made microwaves.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:26.320 align:middle line:90%


01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But for years, the
telecoms industry

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
have defended their actions
by asking the same question.

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.450 align:middle line:90%


01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, they've been
asking the wrong question.

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:41.660 align:middle line:90%


01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.550 align:middle line:90%
The answer is melatonin.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:49.090 align:middle line:90%


01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
You know melatonin is a
hormone and believe it or not,

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.450 align:middle line:90%
it's made in the brain.

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
It's made in the pineal
gland of the brain

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's got a very
powerful antioxidant

01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:03.830 align:middle line:90%
status compared with vitamins.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:10.290 align:middle line:84%
For example, melatonin is five
times as powerful as vitamin C

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and twice as powerful as vitamin
E and it secretes only at night

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:18.939 align:middle line:84%
and it's at night
that we need it

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
because that's
when we go to sleep

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.891 align:middle line:84%
and when our brain repairs
the cells of our body.

01:08:23.891 --> 01:08:27.340 align:middle line:90%


01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's when melatonin
comes out to do its work.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.636 align:middle line:90%


01:08:35.636 --> 01:08:38.430 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Each day our body
loses about half a billion

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:43.415 align:middle line:84%
cells and at night, that's
when our body replaces

01:08:43.415 --> 01:08:48.149 align:middle line:84%
those cells through
a process called cell

01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:50.082 align:middle line:90%
mitosis, the dividing of cells.

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:54.240 align:middle line:90%


01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
What it's doing
is, it's mopping up

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.319 align:middle line:90%
what are called free radicals.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:04.819 align:middle line:84%
These free radicals are really
the spare electrons left over

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:08.800 align:middle line:84%
from the process of making the
energy which we need to repair

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.588 align:middle line:90%
ourselves in the first place.

01:09:11.588 --> 01:09:13.810 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Each night
as our body repairs

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
itself, millions of
free radical cells

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:20.615 align:middle line:84%
are created as a
byproduct of cell mitosis.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:23.880 align:middle line:90%


01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.439 align:middle line:84%
These free radical cells
attack healthy cells.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:33.260 align:middle line:90%


01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
It is universally agreed
that the free radical cell

01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is the main causal
factor in most cancer.

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Our body's main defense
against these free radicals

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.046 align:middle line:84%
is its most powerful
antioxidant, melatonin.

01:09:46.046 --> 01:09:49.700 align:middle line:90%


01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It passes into the
blood stream and its job

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
is to act as a
natural antioxidant,

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.710 align:middle line:90%
a natural anti cancer agent.

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is a very, very
powerful anti-cancer agent.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
What it does is
it acts as what's

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
called an oncostatic
agent, that is

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:11.220 align:middle line:90%
it protects you against cancer.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
It controls the
sleep-wake cycle so

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that you get a good
night's sleep when

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:17.900 align:middle line:90%
you've got proper melatonin.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.510 align:middle line:90%
It's an anti-aging molecule.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, by mopping
up those free radicals,

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.385 align:middle line:84%
it leaves your skin and
complexion looking younger.

01:10:27.385 --> 01:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%


01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We have in our lab
12,000 studies,

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
which we've collected
over the years

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and that is more
studies than have ever

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
been published on
paracetamol, which is the most

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.980 align:middle line:90%
common headache reliever.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
There is more scientific
interest in melatonin

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.990 align:middle line:90%
than there is in paracetamol.

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:59.044 align:middle line:90%


01:10:59.044 --> 01:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: What are the
consequences of having

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
a reduced amount of melatonin?
-Yeah.

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have a reduced
amount of melatonin, what

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.300 align:middle line:84%
happens then is that your
immune system starts to be

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.660 align:middle line:90%
less competent, for a start.

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You tend to get
sleep disturbance.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
You can get off to
sleep or if you do,

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
you wake up and can't
get back to sleep.

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:24.250 align:middle line:84%
You can have heart
complications because melatonin

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.750 align:middle line:90%
protects your heart as well.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:30.790 align:middle line:90%


01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're much more
prone to disease

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:37.450 align:middle line:84%
because your immune system is
not functioning at its best.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of the
things that happen when you

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:41.250 align:middle line:90%
have a lowered melatonin level.

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the average
woman with breast cancer

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
has only got 1/10
of the melatonin

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.000 align:middle line:90%
of a normal woman of her age.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.770 align:middle line:90%


01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And for people with
prostate cancer,

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
they've got less than
half the melatonin

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.070 align:middle line:90%
that they should have.

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Autistic children have less
than half melatonin levels

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.260 align:middle line:90%
that they should enjoy.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Reduced melatonin in
night shift workers--

01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
because they're working at
night and exposed to light;

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:18.040 align:middle line:84%
they don't produce
nocturnal melatonin--

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.570 align:middle line:84%
is known to produce a 50%
increase in breast cancer risk.

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And the International Agency
for Research on Cancer, IARC,

01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
has actually classed night
shift work as a class

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to a probable carcinogen because
of its melatonin reduction.

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of studies now
showing that people on night

01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
shifts or people who are blind
have different cancer rates

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
than the average population
and most of those studies

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
support the view
that the absence

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:56.696 align:middle line:84%
or the lowered melatonin has
an adverse effect on health.

01:12:56.696 --> 01:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Because the body
only repairs itself at night,

01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
melatonin is only produced
when the pineal gland senses

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:04.621 align:middle line:90%
that no light is present.

01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:08.060 align:middle line:90%


01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:12.040 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that the
pineal gland is light sensitive.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.990 align:middle line:10%
It's sitting right
where your brain

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.420 align:middle line:10%
receives signals from
your eyes, that crossover

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.750 align:middle line:10%
point in the middle.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It's called the suprachiasmatic
nuclei and that the connections

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
from there goes directly
to the pineal gland

01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
to tell it whether there's
any light around or not.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.720 align:middle line:84%
If there is light
around, then there's

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.530 align:middle line:84%
also interference
with the signals

01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
the brain wants to send to our
cells in order to repair them.

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So it says there is no point in
the brain sending these signals

01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
out to our cells to
tell them to repair

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
much interference

01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:46.500 align:middle line:90%
that they won't hear it.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.615 align:middle line:84%
So the brain waits
until it's dark.

01:13:49.615 --> 01:14:04.465 align:middle line:90%


01:14:04.465 --> 01:14:06.100 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: What
kind of research

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.556 align:middle line:84%
is shown that there is
an effect on melatonin

01:14:08.556 --> 01:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
production from electric fields,
magnetic fields, radio waves?

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Battelle
Institute in America

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.520 align:middle line:84%
has done a lot of work on this
way back from the late 1970s,

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.980 align:middle line:90%
in fact.

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And their scientists there,
Barry Wilson and Dick Stevens

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and people like that,
started thinking

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
that because we know that
if you turn the light on,

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
then the brain stops making
melatonin, they thought,

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe our brains
can't distinguish

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
between electric fields that
we make ourselves artificially

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and the natural light
that we all know this

01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
happens during the daytime
because we just don't

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.500 align:middle line:90%
make melatonin in the daytime.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Very good biological reasons.

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So they thought, well, maybe
these electric fields are

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
suppressing the
synthesis of melatonin

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and that that, in turn, is
leading to cancer, breast

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
cancer particularly, in
women because they don't

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
have the immunological
protection

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.834 align:middle line:90%
that they would otherwise have.

01:15:14.834 --> 01:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: So the brain
interprets radio waves

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.659 align:middle line:84%
as being light waves.
-Yeah.

01:15:19.659 --> 01:15:20.625 align:middle line:90%
We don't know the difference.

01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:32.862 align:middle line:90%


01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The hypothesis
that the pineal gland cannot

01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
distinguish between
light frequencies

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and man-made frequencies
is certainly backed

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.260 align:middle line:90%
up by a wealth of research.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:16:34.942 align:middle line:90%


01:16:34.942 --> 01:16:36.650 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: Do you think
it's pretty conclusive

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that electric fields,
magnetic fields, radio waves

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.050 align:middle line:84%
effect the production
of melatonin?

01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:48.450 align:middle line:10%
This research, which shows that
kestrel melatonin levels fall

01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:52.540 align:middle line:10%
with exposure, that white
storks nesting on buildings

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:57.660 align:middle line:10%
near to radio masts have lowered
progeny compared with the stork

01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:02.290 align:middle line:10%
nests a long way away from
radio masts, studies on ants,

01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:06.500 align:middle line:10%
studies on bees, studies
on birds of various kinds,

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.390 align:middle line:10%
studies on marine mammals all
point in the same direction.

01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But then there are studies
in the laboratory of cells

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
in the pineal gland,
which actually synthesizes

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:21.220 align:middle line:84%
the melatonin and looking at
the effects of magnetic fields

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.760 align:middle line:90%
on those cells.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And virtually every stage in
the synthesis of melatonin

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
it's been shown
that magnetic fields

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
disturbs the actual
production of melatonin.

01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So you see the evidence is
in all aspects of the pathway

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of melatonin production, that
the inhibition of melatonin

01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
production by our magnetic
fields, the research

01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:50.335 align:middle line:84%
covers really every
aspect of that pathway.

01:17:50.335 --> 01:17:52.484 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: Would you
say that it's conclusive?

01:17:52.484 --> 01:17:56.740 align:middle line:90%


01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I would say it is
almost conclusive.

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:12.376 align:middle line:90%


01:18:12.376 --> 01:18:14.620 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The genius
of our body means

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.723 align:middle line:84%
it is able to counter the
production of free radicals

01:18:16.723 --> 01:18:18.814 align:middle line:84%
with the production
of melatonin.

01:18:18.814 --> 01:18:22.660 align:middle line:90%


01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
We have created in
ourselves a precise balance,

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.084 align:middle line:90%
a perfect system of defense.

01:18:28.084 --> 01:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%


01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It has taken our body
millions of years

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to perfect this
technique, a technique

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
created based on
the surroundings

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.618 align:middle line:90%
we have evolved in.

01:18:40.618 --> 01:18:44.920 align:middle line:90%


01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But over the last few decades,
our surroundings have changed

01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:53.310 align:middle line:90%
and changed exponentially.

01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
To the naked eye, the world
appears to be the same,

01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
but at the cellular
level, it is the biggest

01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:02.656 align:middle line:84%
change in environment
life has ever encountered.

01:19:02.656 --> 01:19:10.380 align:middle line:90%


01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It stands to reason that such
a gargantuan change would

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
inevitably upset such
a delicate balance

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and the consequences
of our bodies

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
not producing the right
amount of melatonin

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:26.560 align:middle line:90%
could be disastrous.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Scientists around the world
now believe that free radicals

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:34.420 align:middle line:84%
could be the causal factor in
every known disease, not just

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.570 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning of the
1900s, childhood leukemia

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
was a medical rarity.

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.570 align:middle line:84%
We've seen nothing but an
increase in childhood leukemia

01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:46.990 align:middle line:90%
ever since that point.

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It's going up every
year by about 2%

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and that applies to
many other disorders

01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
as well, autism,
brain tumors, cancer.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Cancer rates in the
1910s were probably

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:05.810 align:middle line:84%
half of what they are today and
many other diseases are being

01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
connected by scientific
studies with exposure

01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
to electromagnetic fields
and radiations, not

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
just power lines,
but also to radio

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:18.140 align:middle line:90%
fields and microwave fields.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Because in the last
50 years, really,

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.560 align:middle line:84%
we've immersed
ourselves in an ocean

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.330 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic radiation.

01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It's all around us now,
invisible, we can't see it,

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:31.460 align:middle line:90%
but we know it's there.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Every time you lift
up your mobile phone,

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.480 align:middle line:90%
you know it's there.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.450 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very hard to
turn the clock back, if not

01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
impossible to turn
the clock back,

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
but we need to be aware
of those health effects

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
so that we have the choice
of taking precaution

01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:46.080 align:middle line:90%
against the exposures.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
If that's what we wish to do,
that's what we need to do.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
What worries me,
things that are actually

01:20:54.170 --> 01:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
happening now that we haven't
paid enough attention to,

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:01.870 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that's happening

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:10.030 align:middle line:84%
is autism or given
its proper name,

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:12.950 align:middle line:90%
autistic spectrum disorders.

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.060 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: I think we're
getting to a point in science

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
where we almost don't
have a control group to be

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
able to test things like this
because almost everybody has

01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:23.970 align:middle line:84%
a mobile phone, almost
everybody has Wi-Fi,

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:27.251 align:middle line:84%
almost everybody is exposed
to electromagnetic fields.

01:21:27.251 --> 01:21:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:31.490 align:middle line:84%
We are reaching a situation
where so many people are

01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:34.260 align:middle line:84%
exposed to
electromagnetic fields

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
from mobile phones on Wi-Fi
that we no longer have a control

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
population to look at the
difference between the health

01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
for people who are
exposed versus the health

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:48.090 align:middle line:90%
of people who are not exposed.

01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
If I can take an analogy,
we did find out that smoking

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.220 align:middle line:90%
caused lung cancer.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
That was because some
people did not smoke

01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and they were a control group.

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.540 align:middle line:84%
If everyone had
smoked, we may never

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
have found that smoking caused
lung cancer and everyone would

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
have been dying of lung cancer
and it would have been regarded

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of natural
disease without ever

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.180 align:middle line:90%
having a link with smoking.

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
What's happening with
mobile phone exposure

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:18.520 align:middle line:84%
is we are losing this population
of people who are not exposed.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Even the few people who
don't own a mobile phone

01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:23.924 align:middle line:84%
are surrounded by the
radiation from the mobile phone

01:22:23.924 --> 01:22:25.090 align:middle line:84%
when they go
shopping, when they go

01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:27.660 align:middle line:90%
on a train, wherever they go.

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the canary
down the mine like myself.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, if you
simply increase

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic fields in
the atmosphere, which we're

01:22:36.850 --> 01:22:40.220 align:middle line:84%
doing and we've now
got a million times

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
more electromagnetic fields,
microwaves in the environment

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
then we had 30 years
ago, eventually

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:48.250 align:middle line:90%
it will start to affect you.

01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very hard to say
where we might be in 15 years'

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
time, but I would very much hope
within a few years time we do

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.220 align:middle line:84%
recognize just how much these
ill health effects are actually

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.850 align:middle line:84%
costing society and
then we might wake up

01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and look at the causes
and realize we have to do

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.020 align:middle line:90%
something about the causes.

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:15.530 align:middle line:90%


01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:19.730 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: We are a brilliant
yet complex organism.

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
The way that our body functions
isn't by chance, nor is it

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.662 align:middle line:84%
something which has
happened overnight.

01:23:25.662 --> 01:23:28.560 align:middle line:90%


01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Like every other
creature on this planet,

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:40.320 align:middle line:84%
we have adapted into the
environment we exist in,

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
an environment which since
the beginning of time

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
has had a delicate balance
of fields and resonances.

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:50.109 align:middle line:90%


01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:52.900 align:middle line:84%
These phenomena don't
just surround us,

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.820 align:middle line:90%
they make us what we are.

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:57.800 align:middle line:84%
The cells of our body
communicate with each other

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.260 align:middle line:90%
using light frequencies.

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA uses
electromagnetic frequencies

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:05.860 align:middle line:90%
to reproduce itself.

01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.420 align:middle line:90%


01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.490 align:middle line:84%
At the core of
everything are protons

01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and electrons,
positive and negative,

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:17.365 align:middle line:90%
making all life magnetic.

01:24:17.365 --> 01:24:21.860 align:middle line:90%


01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:26.300 align:middle line:84%
We are as all life is equipped
with cryptochrome cells,

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
which allows us to
sense those fields

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.780 align:middle line:90%
in ways we barely understand.

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:34.600 align:middle line:90%


01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We are beings of frequency,
electricity, light,

01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and magnetism and to
become this way has taken

01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
millions of years, a
process which started

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.512 align:middle line:90%
with the very first cell.

01:24:52.512 --> 01:24:55.680 align:middle line:90%


01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Although we have embraced
the wireless technology

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and accepted it into our
everyday lives, at a cellular

01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:06.200 align:middle line:90%
level, our bodies haven't.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies
that now surround us

01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:11.470 align:middle line:84%
are as alien to our cells
as they would be to our eyes

01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:middle line:90%
if only we could see them.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:20.070 align:middle line:90%


01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Our children are being born
into a world that their bodies

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:24.130 align:middle line:90%
simply cannot understand.

01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%


01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Where would all this lead?

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:36.260 align:middle line:90%


01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.130 align:middle line:84%
As this film is being made,
4G technology is being

01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:41.500 align:middle line:90%
rolled out around the world.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:44.562 align:middle line:84%
To accommodate this, the ceiling
levels are being increased.

01:25:44.562 --> 01:25:47.660 align:middle line:90%


01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Wi-Fi is in almost every single
home, school, and business

01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
surrounding us constantly.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Deck phone technology
is the norm in almost

01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:59.880 align:middle line:90%
every single household.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
At a time when the
industries responsible should

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
be displaying caution, they are
displaying a reckless disregard

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.750 align:middle line:90%
for our long-term health.

01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Money talks and
they are about as

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.018 align:middle line:84%
likely to develop a conscience
as the tobacco industries did.

01:26:18.018 --> 01:26:21.010 align:middle line:90%


01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
If there's going to
be a change, it's

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:26.130 align:middle line:90%
not going to come from them.

01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have
to come from us.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
We just need to open our
eyes and see the problem.

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:49.429 align:middle line:90%


01:26:49.429 --> 01:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: With
the MTA [INAUDIBLE],

01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:55.820 align:middle line:84%
do you think fund research
into the radio waves effecting

01:26:55.820 --> 01:27:00.020 align:middle line:84%
melatonin, given that this is
the mechanism that people seem

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to point to, that
mobile phones effect

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:05.280 align:middle line:90%
the production of melatonin.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is an antioxidant,
a free radical vacuum

01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:11.250 align:middle line:90%
cleaner, if you like.

01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:15.560 align:middle line:90%


01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.750 align:middle line:84%
When the issue called
for research proposals

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:23.360 align:middle line:84%
as we're doing at the moment,
while we highlight areas that

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
are of particular interest,
we invite applications,

01:27:29.650 --> 01:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
proposals across the spectrum.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%


01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But it would have
to be prioritized

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.480 align:middle line:84%
alongside the other
applications that we get.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.670 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
limited pot of money,

01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
but we don't rule out funding
research on melatonin.

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not one of the areas
that we've identified

01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:51.910 align:middle line:90%
as a priority at the moment.

01:27:51.910 --> 01:28:21.967 align:middle line:90%
