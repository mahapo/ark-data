00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
You think of someone
and then they ring.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, that's funny,
I was just thinking about you.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
More than 80 percent of people
have had that experience

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:90%
in Europe and America.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:90%
So, it's very common.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Another area is the
feeling of being stared at.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
You turn around,
somebody's looking at you.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Or you stare at someone,
they turn around.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've had these
experiences myself.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, most people have
the sense of being stared at.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:10%
About 90 percent of people have
had that experience, in a way

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:10%
that seems to be telepathic.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So, I've done experiments
to find out whether it

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:90%
really is telepathic.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.559 align:middle line:84%
And yes indeed, or at least
in some cases it seems to be.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:90%

which is still the dominant
theory within academic science,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:90%
says that the mind is the brain.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Mental activity
is brain activity.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
All your thoughts, intentions,
and so on are inside your head.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
What I'm suggesting is they're
not all inside your head.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They extend beyond your
head through fields,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.697 align:middle line:90%

MICHAEL PERSINGER: The
interesting thing-- and we've

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
known it for years, but
somehow it eluded us-- that

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.826 align:middle line:84%
for about 20 minutes during the
acquisition of new information,

00:11:34.826 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:90%
that it's two stages.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
It's electrical,
electromagnetic,

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:90%
and its physical, chemical.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:10%
Its energy and matter.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:10%
And during that
15 to 20 minutes,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:10%
that pattern that
we call experience

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:10%
is transformed into connections
on dendrites' spines

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:10%
that connect.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And in a lifetime,
with all of the energy

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
associated for your
thinking, that's

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:90%
just a few joules of energy.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the thinking.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth's magnetic
field has the capacity

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:90%
to store 10 to the 18th joules.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Which means that the thought of
every person who has ever lived

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:90%
could be there, represented.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So, all this idea says
is that information-- not

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:90%
you, not your sense of self.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a brain phenomenon.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:84%

stored extracerebrally.

In quantum theory, we talk about

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:90%
and basically about noise.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
We have a constant background
noise that is simply there.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:10%
What we do with our
brain is to pull

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:10%
information out of this noise.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:10%
In that sense,
anything at all can

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:10%
be found in the noise field.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
the boundaries of the system
suffer from the following.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for me
to move from a limited system

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
into a broader or a wider one.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier the
other way around.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
When I imagine a big funnel
with the extended system up

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
at the top, then I'm
sitting down at the thin end

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
with my limited brain capacity
and my limited abilities.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they throw a big
bundle of hay into the opening

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
up there, only a single
straw comes out at my end.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the state
of our limitations,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.326 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have to live with
it and fight it for some time

00:19:03.326 --> 00:19:04.025 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:10%
ELIZABETH RAUSCHER:
Eugene Wigner

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:10%
stated that you need to
consider consciousness

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:10%
in understanding physics.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Sir Arthur Eddington
said that physics

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:90%
is the study of consciousness.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And as I grew up in the
woods, in the country

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.420 align:middle line:84%
in northern California, I
felt that experience of being

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:90%
in tune with all nature.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Connected with all existence.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.880 align:middle line:90%
A harmony and peace.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we realized
the power of the influence

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
of our individual thoughts
and our responsibility,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
one of the outcomes
I see is making

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:90%
the world a better place.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The sweeping
transformation of consciousness

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
in 2012 must be accompanied by
changes within our brain, which

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
would enable us to receive
previously inaccessible stimuli

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.126 align:middle line:90%
and coronations.

00:20:01.126 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.765 align:middle line:84%
But what could possibly have
such an effect on our brain?

00:20:09.765 --> 00:20:13.725 align:middle line:90%
[CAMERA FLASH SOUNDS]

00:20:13.725 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Long before I posed this
question in connection

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:84%
with the events
of the year 2012,

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I had witnessed several
clinical experiments in which we

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
studied the effects of
electromagnetic fields

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:90%
on the human brain.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Test subjects were exposed
to such fields, which had

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:90%
been created for the purpose.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And our tests showed
that their brain

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.155 align:middle line:84%
waves were in fact influenced
by the external waves.

00:20:43.155 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:84%
This is significant because
the brain itself works

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
in different frequencies
during different phases

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
sleeping and waking phases.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Current studies confirm that
relative to the strength

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
of the field and
frequency level,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
not only the mood of test
persons can be influenced,

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.976 align:middle line:84%
but their perception, learning
ability, and memory as well.

00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:19.422 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.422 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, electromagnetic fields
have a decisive influence

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:10%
on our brain function and can
rapidly evoke various states

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.747 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL PERSINGER: I think one
of the most important features

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
to remember about our species,
our seven billion brains that

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:84%
make up the human
being as a population,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
is that we're all immersed
within the Earth's

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:90%
magnetic field.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:10%
And even a simple calculation
of magnetic diffusivity, which

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:10%
means the ability to
diffuse information,

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:10%
under the appropriate
conditions,

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:10%
all brains could be connected
within four or five minutes.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Think of every brain
as a copper wire

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and there are seven
billion of them.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.205 align:middle line:84%
What happens if
you had a handful

00:21:59.205 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of these seven billion
wires and you put

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
a magnetic field through it?

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:84%
You would get a mutual current
induced in all of them.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And that current--
that magnetic field--

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
would reflect the
characteristics

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:90%
of all those wires.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And the point is you
could apply something

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:84%
from the external
field and influence

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:90%
every one of those wires.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The Earth vibrates, it
resonates electromagnetically

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.760 align:middle line:84%
in the same ranges
as the human brain.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And through the right resonance,
you could influence all brains.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And since information,
your experiences of images

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts and memories are
resonance in magnetic fields

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
within the brain, the capability
is there to influence not only

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.535 align:middle line:90%
thought but also memory itself.

00:22:45.535 --> 00:22:48.442 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: So, the cause of a
revolutionary transformation

00:22:48.442 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
in our perception
could indeed be a

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:90%
colossal electromagnetic field.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:23:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
When astronauts returned from
the first manned space flight

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:84%
experiencing serious
health problems,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
the term "space
sickness" was coined.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:90%
The cause soon became clear.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
In their space
capsule, the astronauts

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
had been cut off from the
Earth's magnetic field.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:84%
This fact shows with
stunning clarity

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that our Earth's
magnetic field does

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.555 align:middle line:84%
a lot more than just protect
us from cosmic radiation.

00:23:36.555 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Our entire
bio-organism literally

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:90%
harmonizes with this field.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
It regulates the cycles
of life and our body clock

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and could even be
the engine for many

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:90%
of the metabolic processes.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention its significance
for the directional sense

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.024 align:middle line:90%
in both humans and animals.

00:24:00.024 --> 00:24:01.290 align:middle line:10%
ROLLING MCCRATY: The
geomagnetic field

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:10%
is a stable or a
stationary field,

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:10%
kind of like a
refrigerator magnet.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.189 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:07.189 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
If you take a magnet,
that field's always there.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So, the strength
of the field isn't

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:84%
really changing much, at least
not in terms of our day-to-day.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But what does change
daily-- affects

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:90%
us-- is those field lines.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.766 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the
Earth here and you've

00:24:22.766 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
got these magnetic field
lines going thousands of miles

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
out into space all
around the planet,

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
is they interact
with the solar wind.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:84%
They vibrate.
OK?

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So the solar wind
plucks the field lines,

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:90%
very much like a guitar string.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.320 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.540 align:middle line:84%
The Schumann resonances
are determined

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:84%
by the resonate cavity between
the surface of the earth

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and basically the bottom
of the ionosphere.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So when the magnetic waves get
established in this cavity,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
those that are resonant
with the resonant frequency

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:84%
of the cavity become globally
propagating standing waves.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are eight primary
Schumann resonances.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:84%
The first one is 7.8
Hertz, and that's

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:84%
very close to what's
called the alpha rhythm

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:90%
in our brain waves.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:84%
It turns out all eight of these
primary Schumann resonances

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.375 align:middle line:84%
have overlaps with
human brain waves.

00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Of course we cannot
perceive the geomagnetic field

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:90%
directly with our five senses.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we do have the
antennas for it.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
We have at our
disposal more than 5

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
million magnetite crystals
per gram of brain mass.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
They react extremely sensitively
to all the magnetic fields

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in our environment and very
significantly to sudden change.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:10%
When there are magnetic
storms, these magnetic storms

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:10%
can play havoc with satellites.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Communication
satellites, for instance.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:84%
This has been the reason why
there have been some blackouts.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at what is the
physiology of an individual,

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:84%
well, the heart is a very
big electrical circuit.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a big pump.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The brain also has
electrical activity.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So there is no reason to
believe that they will act any

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
differently from the
grid of the satellites

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.690 align:middle line:84%
when they're hit by
a magnetic storm.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:90%

concluded that even trade on the
international stock exchanges

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:84%
is influenced directly
by the activity

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.560 align:middle line:90%
of the geomagnetic field.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:84%
It now appears certain
the geomagnetic field

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
seems to have a decisive
effect on our psyche

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.143 align:middle line:90%
and our biorhythms.

00:27:58.143 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean in relation
to the year 2012 and beyond?

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
For the biophysical and
chemical processes in our brain

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:84%
to change in the way
that we have observed

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:84%
in our experiments
with artificial fields,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.199 align:middle line:84%
very dramatic geomagnetic
turbulence would

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.974 align:middle line:90%
have to occur around this time.

00:28:22.974 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Is a calculable,
perhaps cyclical event

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:84%
actually due to
take place that will

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.770 align:middle line:90%
have an effect on our planet?

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:84%
We know now that in the
history of the Earth

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
there have been regular
incidences of extreme changes

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:90%
to the magnetic field.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
These things appear to be
due to regular cosmic cycles,

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:90%
comparable to the four seasons.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
At this point in the discussion,
the Mayan calendar must

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:90%
inevitably enter the equation.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
According to their
calculations, our year 2012

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.340 align:middle line:84%
is so special precisely because
this is when various cycles

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:90%
end and also begin.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:90%
It's comparable to a clock face.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Once every 12 hours
all three hands

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
point to 12 for the short
duration of one second.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.522 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a closer look at
the cosmic cycles known today.

00:29:36.522 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.125 align:middle line:84%
We are made aware of
them most consciously

00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:44.550 align:middle line:84%
by the alternation
of day and night,

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:84%
caused by the rotation of
the Earth on its own axis.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.032 align:middle line:84%
Indisputably, the most
self evident of all cycles.

00:29:52.032 --> 00:29:57.700 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Just as obvious is
the unit of the month.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Our moon orbits the earth
once in exactly 28 days.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.790 align:middle line:84%
We can clearly observe this
in the various moon phases.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:15.065 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.065 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth takes 365 days for
its journey around the sun.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:90%
In other words, one year.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:84%
The sequence of four seasons
arises over the course

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of the one cycle due
to the slight tilt

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:90%
of our Earth on its axis.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The hemisphere tilted
towards the sun

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is somewhat warmer because the
sun's rays hit it a sharper

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
angle and also because
the days are significantly

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.345 align:middle line:90%
longer there than the nights.

00:30:40.345 --> 00:30:44.074 align:middle line:90%
In this hemisphere, it's summer.

00:30:44.074 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But our Earth's
axis doesn't always

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:90%
tilt in the same direction.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:84%
A cycle that can only be
observed over millennia

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.970 align:middle line:84%
is the procession
of the equinoxes,

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:90%
also known as a platonic year.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth wobbles like
a slow-spinning top,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and it takes around 26,000 years
until the Earth's axis tilts

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.453 align:middle line:90%
in the same direction again.

00:31:05.453 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.490 align:middle line:84%
All of these processes,
which we can confirm

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:84%
with ultra-modern
instruments at best,

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.580 align:middle line:84%
were already well
known to the Maya

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and formed the basis of
their cyclical calendar.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to this
knowledge, they were

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:84%
able to give each
day for centuries

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:90%
ahead its own individual name.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.920 align:middle line:84%
That's very important when
you assume, as did the Maya,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that each day comes with its
own particular quality due to

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:90%
the exact cosmic constellation.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.292 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.292 --> 00:31:42.905 align:middle line:84%
But returning to the
subject of cosmic cycles.

00:31:42.905 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Our entire planetary
system orbits

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
around the center of our galaxy
over an unimaginably long

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:90%
period of time.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
it also oscillates

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:90%
around the galactic equator.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
In this case too,
the length of time

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
it takes for our
planetary system

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to complete one cycle
of rising and sinking

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:12.646 align:middle line:84%
is virtually unfathomable
in human terms.

00:32:12.646 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Mayan calendar--

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.030 align:middle line:84%
the perfect depiction
of cosmic cycles--

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:84%
many such significant cycles are
expected to begin to dovetail

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:90%
dramatically in the year 2012.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Resulting in a
constellation so unusual

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that it will lead
to global changes

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and the much-discussed
higher vibrational level.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:middle line:84%
However, there's
almost nothing we

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.165 align:middle line:84%
can deduce with certainty from
the cycles known to us today.

00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:48.762 align:middle line:90%

do seem to support such

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.500 align:middle line:84%
in cosmic radiation over
many years, for example--

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
the time frame and
distance in question

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
are still far too vast to
enable us to pin these events

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:84%
down to a certain year,
let alone an exact day.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's completely unnecessary
for us to rely on speculation

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:84%
because what is presumably
the most significant source

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:84%
of geomagnetic disturbances,
in the cosmic sense as well,

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:90%
is glaringly obvious.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.924 align:middle line:84%
It is a tiny cog in the
wheel of cosmic cycles,

00:33:28.924 --> 00:33:32.792 align:middle line:84%

devastating economic and

There is a bulk of

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:10%
the whole story consistent.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is very important
because every cycle

that we map, every effect that
you find that may be associated

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
with solar activity or
other cycles that exist

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.150 align:middle line:84%

they're always

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:84%
substantiated on the basis
of statistical analysis.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.740 align:middle line:10%
What that means is that
there is a direct relationship

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:10%
between the mood measure,
the self-rated mood,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.240 align:middle line:10%
and cosmological variables,
both the solar wind

the 1st, 1859, British
astronomer and sun researcher

Richard Carrington
happened by coincidence

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.345 align:middle line:84%
to observe a blazing explosion
on the surface of the sun.

In the nights that followed,
brilliant Northern Lights

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.680 align:middle line:10%

as far from the poles
as Hawaii and Jamaica.

This particularly
severe magnetic storm

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:84%
disabled the telegraph
network worldwide

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and caused the paper in
the teletype machines

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:90%
to burst into flames.

For our modern, high-tech

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.050 align:middle line:90%
doubtless deal a heavy blow.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Power outages, the resulting

But the possible effects
on our bio-organism

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
have largely been
ignored thus far.

Imagine that
someone were to give

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.230 align:middle line:84%
you without your knowledge of
consciousness-expanding drug.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as the
substance takes effect,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.830 align:middle line:84%
you would begin to believe
you were losing your mind

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:84%
because you would start
to feel and perceive

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:84%
things that are not part
of reality as you know it.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:84%
If, on the other hand,
you were to take the drug

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:84%
on purpose, fully
aware of its effect,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.410 align:middle line:84%
it would not take
you by surprise.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
You would be prepared
for it and able to make

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.775 align:middle line:90%
sense of the effect.

Our brain is the interface

a particular sensory impression

is for our survival.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:84%
According to this prioritizing,
we are then either

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:90%
able to perceive it or not.

Some psychoactive substances
have just the opposite effect.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis, for example,
disrupts the ability

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.610 align:middle line:84%
of the visual system to
block out superfluous views

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:90%

But hallucinations, such
as those induced by hashish

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:90%
consumption, are not delusions.

Just as our brain constantly
registers them, but without

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.520 align:middle line:84%
forwarding them on
to our consciousness.

MICHAEL PERSINGER:
Structure dictates function.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.160 align:middle line:84%
All experiences come
from brain function.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences are due
to the structure of the brain

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and the electrical patterns
associated with it.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.610 align:middle line:84%
You could imitate it by giving a
psychotropic drug, for example.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Or you can imitate it
by exposing the brain

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:84%
to the appropriate
intensity temporally

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:90%
patterned magnetic field.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.160 align:middle line:10%
For every molecular
pattern, called chemicals,

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.770 align:middle line:10%
there is an electromagnetic
sequence or temporal pattern

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:44.915 align:middle line:10%
that must be matched.

00:42:44.915 --> 00:42:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you apply
that to the brain,

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.760 align:middle line:84%
you should get
comparable experiences.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have found.

NARRATOR: The human brain
produces a neurotransmitter,

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.990 align:middle line:90%
a molecule very similar to LSD.

00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It's called
Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that even
the tiniest amount

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:84%
of these molecules can
trigger hallucinations

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:90%
in sensitive individuals.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Various experiments
have also shown

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that exposure to certain
electromagnetic fields

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies can
stimulate the brain

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to release DMT molecules.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Such fields have the same
strength and frequencies

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:84%
as what we might be
exposed to during

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:90%
severe geomagnetic storms.

equipped with all
the prerequisites

for an expanded consciousness?

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And that this, let's
call it function,

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.110 align:middle line:84%
need only be activated by the
release of certain messenger

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:90%

now that this infinite vastness

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.220 align:middle line:90%
isn't so empty after all.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:84%
It must contain something that
we can neither see nor measure

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.500 align:middle line:84%
because the familiar
visible material

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.710 align:middle line:84%
phenomena alone cannot
explain the movements

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and observation.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:10%
The fact of the matter is that

GIULIANA CONFORTO: According
to astrophysics, dark matter

00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:03.510 align:middle line:10%
and dark energy, that are both
invisible, assume almost 95%

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:11.870 align:middle line:10%
So what is visible
is just 4%, 5%.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The 4%, 5% are
what we call atoms.

But it reveals itself through
its gravitational interactions

matter, which is what

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.250 align:middle line:10%
we can observe with telescopes.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.240 align:middle line:84%
When one piece of dark
matter meets another piece

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.400 align:middle line:84%
of dark matter, they may
annihilate each other

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.130 align:middle line:90%
and produced gamma rays.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.555 align:middle line:84%
And so, what we're
going to look for are

00:46:37.555 --> 00:46:41.340 align:middle line:84%
the gamma rays from that
dark matter annihilation.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:46.520 align:middle line:84%
If you look at me in
x-ray, I'm not like this,

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a skeleton.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:55.780 align:middle line:84%
If you look at me in infrared
rays, I like a cloud.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So, this ability strictly
depends on the wavelength,

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency
we are observing.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.405 align:middle line:84%
When you look up
in the optical sky,

00:47:06.405 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:84%
it looks very quiescent and
stable and nothing changing

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.540 align:middle line:90%
with time.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.830 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the gamma ray sky,

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.050 align:middle line:84%

are violent phenomena

evolve very quickly.

being an example.

Something that for a brief
instant of time, you know,

about a second, outshines the
entire rest of the universe.

that we are blind.

In my view, what is going to
call that our blindness [FSSH]

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.340 align:middle line:90%
collapse.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this is a radical
change I already think.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.260 align:middle line:90%
But it regards our perception.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't regard the
distraction of the word.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Our mind, that is only linked
to the electromagnetic field.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And scientists do prove this.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll collapse, but
we will not die.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Because we are not our minds.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:90%
We are much more.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So, we will not
see with our eyes,

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:30.690 align:middle line:84%
but we will see or
feel with our bodies.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Because we have inner senses.

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is what is going on.

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.460 align:middle line:84%
We are developing
our inner senses.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.230 align:middle line:84%

the fact that evolution doesn't

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:47.210 align:middle line:90%

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
in circles trying

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.270 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
environment using up

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:04.600 align:middle line:90%
more resources in the process.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.050 align:middle line:84%

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:13.170 align:middle line:84%
All the while, our
instinct tells us

that nothing can change as

to other problems
in the first place.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.710 align:middle line:84%
We've never really
learned to let

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.864 align:middle line:90%
go and recognize the causes.

00:53:39.078 --> 00:53:42.661 align:middle line:84%

life and death and so on.

Science was supposed
to be our saving grace

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and is becoming very dogmatic
as well now in a similar way.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And the application of science
is seriously dangerous.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.053 align:middle line:84%
So, we've got all this
to come out of, you know?

00:53:59.053 --> 00:54:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And people think
this is all there is,

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're used to
being constricted.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Physicists talk about a
final theory of everything.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you think
you know everything,

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.420 align:middle line:90%
you're in for a rude awakening.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the glory of
it all is that we don't know

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:19.090 align:middle line:90%
everything, and it's wonderful.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because in our discoveries
we have the possibility

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:84%
of not only creating a
more Utopian society,

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.140 align:middle line:84%
but getting in touch
with how we can

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.190 align:middle line:84%
have peace, love,
and joy instead

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:33.760 align:middle line:90%
of war, crime, and violence.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be very
difficult for a lot of people

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to just suddenly let
go of that and be

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:43.820 align:middle line:84%
free and be able to function
in a different reality.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.960 align:middle line:90%
They won't want to, probably.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Most of them, a lot
of them won't want to.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The major impedance
of this is science.

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Science has become very
narrow, very restricted.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there could
be new phenomena, phenomena

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't imagined,
is a very difficult thing

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:84%
for many contemporary
scientists to understand

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.940 align:middle line:90%
or appreciate or even accept.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
time because the younger

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.300 align:middle line:84%
generations are more
open than the older ones.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:84%
As Max Planck said, for such
paradigm shifts to occur,

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:20.360 align:middle line:84%
you have to wait until old
ones die out for the young ones

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.195 align:middle line:90%
to do things differently.

00:55:21.195 --> 00:55:24.860 align:middle line:90%

doubled its speed of approach.

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The gravitational
pull of the black hole

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
has also increased and
begun to elongate its shape.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Astrophysicists speak
of a vacuum process,

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
which according to
some calculations,

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:40.740 align:middle line:90%
will continue until mid 2013.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
After which, it will
have reached its maximum.

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the ever-increasing
gravitational force

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
of the black hole will
consume the plasma cloud.

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, just
before the final remnants

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
are pulled in, they reach such
extremely high temperatures

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that astrophysicists expect an
eruption at Sagittarius A that

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
will send a massive
wave of cosmic rays

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:06.980 align:middle line:90%
surging in our direction.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.940 align:middle line:90%


01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Along with
gravitational waves, we

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
can expect highly charged
x-rays, gamma rays, and radio

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
waves to collide with
Earth, causing potentially

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.160 align:middle line:90%
unforetold energetic effects.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Radio waves in
particular have an effect

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
upon biological systems that
is often underestimated.

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Our human DNA has a resonance
frequency of 150 megahertz.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
In this frequency range,
even the slightest

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
field strengths are enough to
produce biophysical affects.

01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:48.780 align:middle line:84%
They can cause mood changes,
and they trigger altered states

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Reference measurements have
shown that the 150 megahertz

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
high-frequency
wave in particular

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
activates production of our
own internal psychoactive

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.720 align:middle line:90%
substances.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
One gland in the brain in
particular, the pineal gland,

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most powerful
producers of such substances

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.130 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is
also hypersensitive

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
external magnetic fields

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.870 align:middle line:90%
and radio waves.

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It could, for example, act
as an excellent transmitter

01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:26.520 align:middle line:90%
and receiver of cosmic signals.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
In 1972, Nobel Prize
winner Julius Axelrod

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
discovered that the human
pineal gland naturally

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
produces one particularly
potent psychoactive substance,

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
originally called telepathine
due to its enhancement

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.010 align:middle line:90%
of psychic abilities.

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Some refer to as
the spirit molecule.

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:53.720 align:middle line:10%
One of the interesting
things about DMT

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.370 align:middle line:10%
is it's actively
transported into the brain

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:58.650 align:middle line:10%
across the blood-brain barrier.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the brain requires
DMT for normal function.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Which is a strange idea.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
DMT seems like a building
block for our perception

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:09.900 align:middle line:90%
of everyday reality.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
That's everyday reality.

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
That just isn't some future,
like, apocalyptic time.

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:19.130 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if we're
all kind of living

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:22.350 align:middle line:84%
in an apocalyptic time right
now because it's being mediated

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:26.910 align:middle line:84%
by some chemical
substance, which kind

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.810 align:middle line:90%
of is holding things together.

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:31.620 align:middle line:90%


01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:37.189 align:middle line:84%
If you think about consciousness
as occurring within the brain,

01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:43.806 align:middle line:84%
and if you think about the brain
as the organ of consciousness,

01:08:43.806 --> 01:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I began to think about
the prospect of DMT

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:51.859 align:middle line:84%
changing brain
chemistry and then

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
the capacity of consciousness
to experience other levels

01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:00.310 align:middle line:90%
of reality than what occur.

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like the notion
of a television receiver.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.229 align:middle line:90%
You can change channels.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And some of the channels
are everyday reality,

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:16.359 align:middle line:84%
and other channels seem to be
specific to the DMT experience.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
geomagnetic storm,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.370 align:middle line:84%
you can get
microstructural changes

01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:21.795 align:middle line:90%
within the brain tissue itself.

01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Now if you change structure,
you change function.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.609 align:middle line:90%
Which means the entire species.

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:30.229 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every living thing on
this planet could be altered.

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
The other important
thing to remember

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
is that how much of
a change in the gene

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:41.210 align:middle line:84%
is required to alter the
structure of the human brain?

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.200 align:middle line:84%
You realize a single-point
mutation-- that's

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.569 align:middle line:84%
one small position of that
DNA, of that three billion base

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
pairs that make up our
genome-- one small change,

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:55.945 align:middle line:84%
and you lose your
ability for language.

01:09:55.945 --> 01:09:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Now let's turn it around.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Just suppose that famous
event, whatever it was, when

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.650 align:middle line:84%
all cultures began
to use language

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:04.590 align:middle line:84%
more or less at
the same time, was

01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
because of a point mutation that
spread throughout our species.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.080 align:middle line:90%
What would have done it?

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It had to be something that
would have united all of us,

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.140 align:middle line:84%
something to which every
human being was exposed.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.470 align:middle line:90%
And this Earth's magnetic field.

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:28.410 align:middle line:90%


01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You look historically,
you'll find

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that these massive
global changes and

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
what we call
revitalization movements

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
or revival movements or feelings
where there's massive movements

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
of an idea often occur during
periods of certain kinds

01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:43.950 align:middle line:90%
of geomagnetic activity.

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Remember for the human
brain, it's not the amount,

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.990 align:middle line:90%
it's the quality.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:49.460 align:middle line:90%
It's the pattern.

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later we will have
a geomagnetic storm that

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.100 align:middle line:84%
has that appropriate
pattern that will influence

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.450 align:middle line:90%
large portions of individuals.

01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Who will see all
kinds of things,

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
perceive all kinds of phenomenon
that are remarkably similar.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Modern science tends to feel
somewhat uncomfortable when

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
you make the assumption
that all of us

01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:13.310 align:middle line:90%
belong to the same species.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're all exposed
to the same environment.

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And that global changes
could influence us

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:19.590 align:middle line:90%
all simultaneously.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And influence the
direction of history.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.810 align:middle line:84%
That takes away the
sense of human control

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.260 align:middle line:90%
over their destiny.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It's an anxiogenic idea,
anxiety-producing idea

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:33.380 align:middle line:90%
to many people.

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But I think the data indicate
that's probably correct.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.230 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: So it's
conceivable then

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that an increase in
our consciousness,

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.520 align:middle line:84%
sparked by this kind of
grand celestial event,

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
could provide us with
a direct cognition

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
of the hyper-real
state of existence.

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:53.990 align:middle line:90%


01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Heraclitus acclaimed that there
are three states of being.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Man is aware of only two, the
sleeping and waking states.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.217 align:middle line:84%
The state of full consciousness,
however, still remains elusive.

01:12:07.217 --> 01:12:39.080 align:middle line:90%


01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
RICK STRASSMAN: When you start
to think about spaces which are

01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
most of the time
invisible, that starts

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to kind of-- well,
that begins to move

01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:52.440 align:middle line:90%
into concepts of spirituality.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
spirituality in a way

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:58.070 align:middle line:84%
as the science of
invisible things--

01:12:58.070 --> 01:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, metaphysics,
as it were--

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.490 align:middle line:84%
you can overlap
between spiritual world

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
views and some other world
views that are coming

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.775 align:middle line:90%
out of contemporary physics.

01:13:07.775 --> 01:13:11.000 align:middle line:90%


01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.480 align:middle line:10%
One of the reasons that I ended
up calling my book "The Spirit

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.310 align:middle line:10%
Molecule" is because I began
to conceive of the DMT state

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:21.380 align:middle line:10%
as a spiritual one.

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And that DMT is a
mediator, as it were,

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:30.110 align:middle line:84%
between the physical
and the incorporeal.

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:36.310 align:middle line:10%
You know, the material
in the spiritual,

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:37.930 align:middle line:10%
INTERPRETER: We
biological lifeforms

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:41.290 align:middle line:10%
basically have free access
to a three-dimensional space.

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:44.700 align:middle line:10%
But it appears the layers
above that-- the hyperspaces--

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.920 align:middle line:10%
can be accessed only
with phase changes

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.810 align:middle line:10%
to a higher consciousness.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the threshold on which
humankind is now poised.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
J. J. HURTAK: We as a humanity
occupy a consciousness

01:13:57.570 --> 01:13:59.090 align:middle line:90%
reality that can be changed.

01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And as we begin to use
positive energy and creativity,

01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:07.348 align:middle line:10%
we open up sides of the human
psyche known as the left

01:14:07.348 --> 01:14:08.750 align:middle line:10%
and right hemisphere.

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
One which is highly
scientific, and one which

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.600 align:middle line:90%
is highly multidimensional.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.600 align:middle line:84%
We discover that we are
multidimensional beings.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
INTERPRETER: Four-dimensional
space time continuum,

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
as Albert Einstein
basically introduced it

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
into modern physics,
won't do it for us.

01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't account for all
particle characteristics.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.200 align:middle line:90%


01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the great
transit of our mind

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
from a three-dimensional space
to a hyper-dimensional space.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other huge
passage is from one

01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
only time-- from
past to future--

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
to many, multiple times.

01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:55.470 align:middle line:10%
We're putting forth
the concept that we

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:57.835 align:middle line:10%
exist in a consciousness field.

01:14:57.835 --> 01:15:00.110 align:middle line:10%
The consciousness
of our thoughts

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:01.520 align:middle line:10%
are not limited to our brain.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you start understanding
that you, realize that not only

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
can we affect things
going on around the globe,

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
but we can also receive
information that comes

01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:12.040 align:middle line:90%
from outside the local sphere.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've been able to play with
not only space but also time,

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.870 align:middle line:84%
where you can go forward
and also reverse.

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So, from linear
time to a multiple,

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.860 align:middle line:90%
many dimensional times.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we are
going to the end of times.

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
That it's actually the beginning
of eternity, in my view.

01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
What we're now seeing is
that today's modern physics

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
is possibly laying the
scientific foundation

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
for the spiritual
experiences that people

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:46.735 align:middle line:84%
have been reporting for
hundreds and thousands of years.

01:15:46.735 --> 01:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
INTERPRETER: All paranormal
phenomena, in fact,

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
can be explained
using this model.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:53.450 align:middle line:10%
Just one example
is psychokinesis.

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:57.790 align:middle line:10%
Uri Geller can bend spoons,
everyone knows that.

01:15:57.790 --> 01:16:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have to say he's not quite
normal because normal is what

01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:05.990 align:middle line:90%
the majority can do and does.

01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But in his case, the channels
that access the brain from out

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
of these trans-dimensions--
the higher levels--

01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:15.890 align:middle line:90%
aren't completely leak proof.

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:16.785 align:middle line:90%
They're not quite solid.

01:16:16.785 --> 01:16:19.700 align:middle line:90%


01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the will
can bypass the cortex

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and reach directly
into this other space.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So, I can imagine that
there are some people--

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and this is said
to be so-- who have

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.135 align:middle line:90%
dissolved certain barriers.

01:16:32.135 --> 01:16:34.070 align:middle line:90%


01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
These are the people
we call mediums.

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Those who can see
into the other side.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Parapsychological
studies have shown

01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that when you get
a group of mediums

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
together they all
see the same thing.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
In that scenario, those of
us without medial abilities--

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't have them--
are the anormal ones.

01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:59.380 align:middle line:84%
The mediums are normal because
they're in the majority,

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and they can see
things I can't see.

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.240 align:middle line:10%
To actually
experience this level,

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.820 align:middle line:10%
we have to be able
to cross over,

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.290 align:middle line:10%
or transcend, the level
of our normal waking

01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:11.320 align:middle line:10%
or quotidian consciousness.

When you're speaking

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
about these huge, large-scale
celestial events to the extent

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that they do impact
the formation of DMT,

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting
to think about what

01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:29.460 align:middle line:90%
that world would look like.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
If every organism which
contained the DMT synthesizing

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
gene were flooded with
high levels of DMT,

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the implication is that
all those organisms would

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.840 align:middle line:90%
be entering into the DMT state.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:48.790 align:middle line:90%


01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: What
would DMT look like?

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
What if we took a look
into a clinical study

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:57.670 align:middle line:90%
group testing its effects?

01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
This may provide some clues
as to what one could expect.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
RICK STRASSMAN: So, as a
result of getting an injection

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
of a high dose of
DMT, the effects

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
began almost immediately,
within a couple of heartbeats.

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
buildup of internal pressure

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:21.112 align:middle line:84%
and a sound, which also is
building up in intensity.

It's all around
us, it's invisible.

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
It affects us a little bit, and
also, we can affect it a lot.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
The experiences
seemed more real

01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:58.690 align:middle line:84%
than real, which really
called into question

01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Because if that
were the case, that

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.490 align:middle line:84%

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Why we hanging onto it?

MICHAEL KONIG
(THROUGH INTERPRETER):

01:32:53.614 --> 01:32:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Climate change,
overpopulation, food shortages,

01:32:56.970 --> 01:32:59.250 align:middle line:84%
economic problems,
natural resources

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:01.480 align:middle line:90%
plundered, and on and on.

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Many things are
way out of balance,

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.025 align:middle line:84%
and these developments
all seem exponential.

01:33:06.025 --> 01:33:08.710 align:middle line:90%


01:33:08.710 --> 01:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And what humans don't
typically do well with

01:33:11.490 --> 01:33:16.650 align:middle line:84%
is we don't like change,
especially unexpected change.

01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can
go ahead at that speed

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.700 align:middle line:90%
with the old system.

01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.990 align:middle line:84%
We just-- we will
burn to a frazzle.

01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:middle line:90%


01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, you say, well,
that's pretty negative

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:30.720 align:middle line:90%
and it's very doomsday.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are
remarkably resourceful.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.120 align:middle line:84%
When we're anxious, we do
a lot of positive things.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Margaret Mead
said, it only takes

01:33:39.710 --> 01:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
a few good people
with a like vision

01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to change the model of
what people believe.

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And I actually don't
think it takes that many,

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:53.150 align:middle line:90%
but they have to be coherent.

01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:56.765 align:middle line:84%
We are developing
our inner senses.

01:33:56.765 --> 01:34:00.210 align:middle line:90%
They're just not outside.

01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have
an active solar cycle,

01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
which we're going
into now, there

01:34:05.210 --> 01:34:07.960 align:middle line:90%
is an effect on our brainwaves.

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.730 align:middle line:90%
But there may be deeper effects.

01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And so the anticipation
of the Mayan 2012

01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:16.260 align:middle line:84%
might be very good
because we may

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:23.380 align:middle line:84%
be anticipating and that
way creating a new reality.

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:26.860 align:middle line:84%
The direct relationship between
the size of the universe,

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the diameter of the proton, and
man's range of vision is part

01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of a larger
mass-energy-space-time

01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:37.270 align:middle line:84%
transformation, which
involves changes in our basic

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:39.305 align:middle line:90%
concepts of the known universe.

01:34:39.305 --> 01:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is
really the beginning

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:46.360 align:middle line:84%
of a whole new understanding
of consciousness physics.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Some people say 2012.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.870 align:middle line:90%
It might be.

01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:53.800 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
all possibilities

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.360 align:middle line:90%
will be able, good and bad.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have to
think it's possible.

01:35:00.810 --> 01:35:02.560 align:middle line:84%
People won't try
to build something

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.710 align:middle line:90%
they think is impossible.

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:12.710 align:middle line:84%
The key point is that there
is not only one future,

01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:15.930 align:middle line:90%
there will be many futures.

01:35:15.930 --> 01:35:21.646 align:middle line:84%
As well as there is not only one
past, but there are many pasts.

01:35:21.646 --> 01:35:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The present is the moment
in which we can choose.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I choose freedom.

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:33.237 align:middle line:90%


01:35:33.237 --> 01:35:35.140 align:middle line:84%
ROLLIN MCCRATY: The way
that I think of this

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
is it's an energetic
influx, and we

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:41.783 align:middle line:84%
really have the
choice of how we're

01:35:41.783 --> 01:35:43.300 align:middle line:90%
going to process that energy.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about 2012,
one of my main messages

01:35:47.410 --> 01:35:51.330 align:middle line:84%
is that, yeah, these cycles are
real, these external cycles.

01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the greatest
periods of human flourishing

01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:56.300 align:middle line:84%
during these same cycles,
not just the negative stuff.

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe we are in
a special time in history now.

01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a great
opportunity we have

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
to create more collaborations,
to really access

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.790 align:middle line:90%
more of our heart intuition.

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a great time
to be more aligned

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.560 align:middle line:84%
to create more
caring relationships,

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.690 align:middle line:84%
find more creativity, to really
solve these problems as we're

01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:16.880 align:middle line:90%
going through the shift.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:20.110 align:middle line:84%
To learn how to access
more of that intuition

01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about, to
become self responsible

01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:25.172 align:middle line:84%
and use it in very
positive ways.

01:36:25.172 --> 01:36:30.419 align:middle line:90%

ERNST SENKOWSKI
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

01:36:31.618 --> 01:36:33.590 align:middle line:84%
The word has fallen
into disrepute,

01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:35.360 align:middle line:90%
yet the world is awash with it.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.520 align:middle line:90%
The word, of course, is love.

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Love is the most
powerful force of nature.

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.882 align:middle line:84%
So, why scientists
don't find love?

01:36:44.882 --> 01:36:49.020 align:middle line:84%
They use means
through which they

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.260 align:middle line:90%
cannot discover this force.

01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Because they use
artificial instruments

01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:59.820 align:middle line:84%
that don't feel love,
and they use mathematics

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:02.590 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't imply love.

01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:07.975 align:middle line:84%
But our minds and
essentially our bodies can.

01:37:07.975 --> 01:37:12.220 align:middle line:84%
--[INAUDIBLE] try to
love ourselves, we

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.886 align:middle line:90%
really [INAUDIBLE] ourselves.

01:37:13.886 --> 01:37:15.778 align:middle line:90%
So, it's a win-win situation.

01:37:15.778 --> 01:37:19.570 align:middle line:90%


01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I find young and old and
in between really looking

01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:27.980 align:middle line:84%
for different vision, to
move to peace, love, and joy,

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:30.060 align:middle line:84%
or at least towards
that direction

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:32.450 align:middle line:90%
from war, crime, and violence.

01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:35.350 align:middle line:84%
A new way of understanding
our wonderful connection

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:39.210 align:middle line:84%
with all of nature and
how we experience that.

01:37:39.210 --> 01:37:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Not just as a piece of
knowledge of physics saying,

01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:46.060 align:middle line:84%
well, I need to do
this to survive.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But in order to enhance
our spiritual feelings

01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and to find out that we
really are in tune with God's

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.420 align:middle line:90%
creation and existence.

01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I believe that many people have
decided already whether or not

01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:05.940 align:middle line:90%
participating in the changes.

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.850 align:middle line:84%
The roads will
split in humanity.

01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
There will be some who will
hang on like [INAUDIBLE] death.

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And others will say, I'm
going with the Earth.

01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:17.675 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to follow the
rhythm of the Earth.

NARRATOR: In conclusion,
only one question remains.

01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:29.480 align:middle line:84%
If we already suspect that our
world is not what we believe it

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to be, that our consciousness
is more than our brain,

01:38:33.190 --> 01:38:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and that everything is
connected to everything else,

01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:39.120 align:middle line:84%
why should we wait
for a cosmic event

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.870 align:middle line:90%
to bring us love and harmony?

01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:47.720 align:middle line:84%
After all, right now, today, we
all have not only the capacity

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.800 align:middle line:84%
but also the responsibility
to change our world

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:56.740 align:middle line:84%
with our thoughts and our
actions, each one of us,

01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.240 align:middle line:90%
