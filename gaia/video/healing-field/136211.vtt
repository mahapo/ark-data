Breakthroughs in science,
medicine, and consciousness

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.820 align:middle line:84%
are happening at an
accelerating rate.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the field of health care,
the old, conventional model

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:84%
relying on surgery
and prescription drugs

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:84%
is being challenged by a
wave of dramatic, noninvasive

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:90%
energy-based techniques.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:84%
While many of these techniques
are actually centuries old

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and are considered controversial
by mainstream Western medicine,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
they are generating
worldwide studies

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:90%
with remarkable results.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore how this
fascinating field affects

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550 align:middle line:84%
our health, our
society, and our future.

in the field of quantum physics,
DNA, and stem cell biology,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and is the winner of the
2009 Goi Peace Award.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:10%
He has written two books,
including the best seller,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.662 align:middle line:10%
"The Biology of Belief."

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>> In today's world
of health care,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:10%
there are two different models
of how the human biology works.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:10%
One of them is based
on the physical reality

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:10%
that everything in the
universe is made out of matter.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is a Newtonian view
that conventional medicine

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:90%
works with.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And the view basically
says that the body

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
is a machine, it's made out
of chemicals, and genes,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and that if there's anything
wrong with the machine,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:84%
you actually adjust
the chemicals

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and genes as a primary
source of the problem.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Another view is based
on quantum physics, that

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
says that the universe is
actually made out of energy,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and everything that we
see as matter is itself

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
actually energy.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The significance of the
difference between the two

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
is, invisible forces
play a primary role

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
in the new understanding
of biology.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:90%
The new energy medicine.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And energy becomes entangled.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Meaning everything
that's made out of energy

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.966 align:middle line:84%
becomes entangled--
you can't separate it.

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So that says, when we're
looking at an individual's life,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.399 align:middle line:84%
we're not looking just
at their physical body.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But we're looking at
their health in regard

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to what their
perceptions of the world

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
are, their family relationships,
their jobs relationships,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:90%
world issues at that moment.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
impinges upon our health.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Beverly Rubik

She is renowned for
her exploration of,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and her countless studies,
concerning energy medicine.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The old medicine is not
helping us during this era

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:10%
where chronic degenerative
disease is the major culprit.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:84%
It's perfect for things like
trauma, or infectious diseases,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
but very limited
in terms of dealing

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
with our chronic illnesses
like diabetes, and cancer,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and heart disease.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's also unsustainable.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It's way too costly.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It's simply not helping people.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
horrendous side effects.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
number one causes of death

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:90%
is death by medicine.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we drastically need
something bigger and better.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the changes is
that enhanced self-care moves

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to the forefront of
the new medicine.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
That people need to take
more self-responsibility

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:90%
for their health and wellness.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So it sort of turns the
pyramid upside down.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Where self-care was
sort of brushed aside

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
by the old
conventional paradigm,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:90%
it comes into the forefront.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:10%
Experiment."

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:10%
>> The new medicine is all
about looking at the body

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:10%
as a dynamic system.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:10%
And understanding that if you
affect one part of the body you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:10%
affect the rest of it.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:84%
You put medicine on
your arm, and you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:90%
create changes in your leg.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:90%
In your liver.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So the new approach is
to approach the body

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:90%
as a holistic system.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:90%
And also an energy system.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't
have to do things

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:90%
grossly to our physicality.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
We can treat ourselves
through energy.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And treat ourselves
through things

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:90%
that we can't really see.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Medicine."

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Energy medicine has
been around for many,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:10%
many thousands of years.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.840 align:middle line:10%
But for written documentation,
we go to the Chinese,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.650 align:middle line:10%
and they started documenting
it about 5,000 years ago.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:84%
There are many reasons
for why energy medicine is

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
becoming so popular.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.050 align:middle line:90%
It's effective.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:90%
It's gentle.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:90%
It's noninvasive.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
have side effects.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
About 55% of the population now
are using alternative medicine

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.675 align:middle line:84%
and integrative
medicine, because they

00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:90%
are getting results.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot cheaper
than going to a doctor.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The late Dr. Candace Pert was
an internationally recognized

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:84%
neuroscientist and
pharmacologist,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and expert in
mind/body medicine.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:10%
>> In the history of medicine,
mind, emotion, spirit,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:10%
was completely left out.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the Western mainstream
medicine as we know it.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:84%
This came from a silly
thing-- from when

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Descartes was given the dead
bodies by the Pope to work on.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So everything about mainstream
medicine is sort of lifeless.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
What's happening now,
what's so exciting,

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
is to incorporate the new
paradigm ideas into medicine.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Not just that mind
matters, but mind

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
is really central to our
health, and to our disease.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably since
Newton and Descartes,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
magic and mysticism has been
ripped out of our lives.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's been an
enormous separation

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:90%
between science and religion.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
However, with the
discoveries made

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:84%
since Einstein and the
advent of quantum physics,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
we've understood that the world
is very different from what

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:90%
we've been told.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And that it is much closer to
what the ancients described.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:90%
There is magic.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
There is connection
between all things.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> While many scientific
advances in the future will

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
undoubtedly be created
from gene editing,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
breakthrough research now shows
that our health is not dictated

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
by our genetic
blueprints after all.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Today's view of genetics
has completely changed.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The old view, of which I trained
in and taught medical students,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
was a view called
genetic determinism.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is the belief that
the genes control your traits.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Not just your structural,
but your physical, emotional,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and behavioral
traits as well, so

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
that our lives were a printout
of our genetic lineage.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a new science
today called epigenetics.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
I first saw the nature of
epigenetics 40 years ago,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:90%
when I was culturing stem cells.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I had genetically identical
cells in three dishes,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
but changed the
environment in each dish.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:90%
In one dish they formed muscle.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
In one dish the
cells formed bone.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
In the third dish,
they formed fat cells.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The important point
was, all the cells

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:90%
were genetically identical.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Their fates were controlled
by the environment.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Today, this new understanding
of environmental control

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
over genes is called
epigenetic control.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:10%
>> What we're now understanding
is that, in any cell,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:10%
the membrane of a cell
is semi-permeable.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
little protein gatekeepers

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
there, that are receptors,
that sort of let information

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:90%
in or out.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're now understanding
that everything

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
in our environment-- our
diet, the air we breathe,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
the emotions we hold,
the sum total of how

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
we live our lives--
affects whether a gene gets

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:90%
turned on or off.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Now this is profound,
because it completely

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
contradicts what we think
of as Darwinian genetics.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that, we are
driven by our genes.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, how can that be if one
little environmental thing

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
like a vitamin can derail
all of your genetic history?

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So scientists are
busy looking at cancer

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things
from the epigenome,

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that, really,
we are getting constructed,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, from outside in.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Not inside out, as we thought.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The fate of our cells is
controlled by the chemistry

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:90%
of our blood.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And the chemistry of
our blood is adjusted

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
by the way we perceive life.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.324 align:middle line:84%
So that if we open up our eyes
and see love in our presence,

00:08:35.324 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
we release chemistry
in the blood,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:84%
such as oxytocin,
dopamine, serotonin.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals promote health
and vitality of the system.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, however,
if I open up my eyes

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and I see something that
threatens me or scares me,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I release a completely different
set of chemicals into my blood,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
such as stress
hormones and histamine.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
The difference is,
these chemicals

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
actually shut down my growth,
and prepare me for protection.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:10%
So it becomes very
critical on how

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:10%
we see the world, because
our perceptions are converted

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:10%
into chemistry, and
the chemistry directly

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:10%
controls, not just our behavior,
but our genetic expression

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> As we learn that our
genes can actually be turned

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
on and off-- not just with
drugs, supplements, and food,

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
but also by our attitudes--
scientific pioneers are now

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
exploring how our nonphysical
energy field interacts with

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:90%
our health.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:10%
They call our
field the biofield.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the notion of layers
of subtle bodies comes out

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Indian thinking, or
the ancient Oriental medicine.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout the ages, mystics
have talked about, you know,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:10%
the "source."

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:90%
The "matrix."

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of
all-encompassing field.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But now, since the advent
of quantum physics,

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
we've understood that
there is a quantum field.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And physicists are able to do a
number of types of experiments

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate and
actually measure

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.379 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in this field.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a new understanding
in the relationship of matter

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:10%
and energy, based
on quantum physics.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:10%
And the issues
about energy healing

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:10%
that are different
from mechanical healing

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:10%
is that energy involves
invisible waves, which

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:10%
include thought,
and what, actually,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:10%
physicists call the "field."

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:84%
The field is a whole
collection of all the energy

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that makes up the universe.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, the field
is what shapes matter.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
As Einstein once
remarked, the field

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:84%
is the sole governing
agency of a particle.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:84%
What he was talking about
is that the invisible forces

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:84%
are primary in shaping
the physical world.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Biofield is an organizing
field within and around

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:90%
the human body.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Or any living thing,
for that matter.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's subtle.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's very complex,
in that it consists

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:10%
of many types of
fields that we already

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:10%
know about-- so-called
electromagnetic fields,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.540 align:middle line:10%
biophotons, or very
low-level particles of light,

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:10%
infrared emission, the brain
waves and the heart waves.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Several decades ago, a German
physicist called Fritz-Albert

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Popp, by accident, discovered
that there is light coming out

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:90%
of living things.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
That all living things send
out a tiny current of light.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
He called it
biophoton emissions.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And he found that this
light is generated in DNA,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and acts as a kind of global
signaling for the entire body.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And also is a communication
system with the outside world.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And we find that
when somebody is ill

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and you apply medicine
to one part of the body,

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
the light doesn't
just change there.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It changes around the body.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
This is an
extraordinary discovery,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:84%
because it demonstrates that the
real orchestrator of the body

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:90%
isn't genes or genetic code.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It's light.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're
talking about fields,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
they actually extend
throughout space,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:90%
as far as the universe goes.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So we are radiating, like
stars, very low-level light

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:90%
into the universe.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:10%
And as a result of this, we
cannot put a boundary on one

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:10%
person's biofield and say, your
biofield stops here and another

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:10%
one starts over there.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways, we're actually
all entangled in this web

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
of life-- of life energy.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And also, the earth has
some dominant frequencies

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
in its energy
field, one of which

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:84%
is called the Schumann
resonance, about 7.8

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Hertz, which very
interestingly is also

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
one of the chief
frequencies that's

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:84%
coming right from our
brains when we're very

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:90%
relaxed-- about eight Hertz.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
it's any accident.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:10%
And we cannot clearly
distinguish any separation

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:10%
between the fields of life
and the fields of earth,

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:10%
and cosmos.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So that makes it all part
of one rich living universe.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of these discoveries,
some experts are calling

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:84%
for a revolutionary new
field-based view of medicine

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and the human body.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a radical
evolution in health care.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:10%
And it's brought about
by new modalities that

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:10%
emphasize energy and vibration.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Einstein said, the
field is the only reality.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a brilliant phrase,
because it really

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:84%
encapsulates what things in
the universe actually are.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:10%
We think of-- all of us, and all
things-- as discrete objects.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:10%
But actually we're part of a
giant quantum energy field.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Energy medicine, which
regards the body not just

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:10%
as a bag of our molecules,
but as primary fields

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:10%
of information that can
be shifted by different

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:10%
therapeutics, whether it be
homeopathy, or energy healers,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:10%
or devices that put out
certain frequencies to shift

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:10%
the biofield.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And by shifting the biofield,
we shift the dynamics

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:18.322 align:middle line:84%
of the body toward a movement
toward health and wellness.

00:14:18.322 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> We find that the atoms
aren't physical themselves.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.464 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
energy vortices.

00:14:22.464 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They're like little
miniature tornadoes.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
But every atom is actually
a vibrational field.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
The significance of
this is that when

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:84%
we look at the body through
the new scan systems,

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:84%
such as PET scans and
CAT scans and MRI scans,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
we're actually looking at the
energy profiles of our body.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Not the physical
expression of it.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Significance in healing is
that in quantum physics,

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
the energy can be
adjusted by other energy,

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:90%
rather than through chemistry.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And research has now revealed
that energy information signals

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:84%
are 100 times more efficient
in controlling biology

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
than our chemical signals.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
The net result is,
we will move away

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:84%
from the pharmaceutical
pursuit of healing

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and move into the
energy field, that's

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
a much more effective and
efficient way of introducing

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:90%
health into our body.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Along with the remarkable
discoveries about the biofield

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and genetic behavior, one of the
most extraordinary new fields

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
of research focuses on how
our emotions affect our health

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The leading pioneer
in this field

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.030 align:middle line:84%
is the late Dr.
Candace Pert, author

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of the groundbreaking book
"The Molecules of Emotion."

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Really, the purpose of
"The Molecules of Emotion"

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:10%
is to regenerate our body/minds.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:10%
So every time we think,
every time we emote,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:10%
we are moving cells,
we are growing cells,

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:10%
and changing the fabric of
the body with every thought.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Every thought is
changing our emotions,

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and every emotional expression
is rewiring our brain.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions are
the key, because they're

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:84%
in the physical realm in
the forms of these molecules

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of emotion, but they're also
this mysterious energetic

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
The key is that they are
carrying information.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They can carry it
to a synapse that's

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
a few-- less than
a millimeter away,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
or they can carry information
all over the body.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you have a
profound emotional trigger,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
every single receptor
in your body shifts.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that emotion is felt
all over the entire body/mind.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Negative thinking, along
with negative emotions-- fear,

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:10%
anxiety, feeling stressed,
which is most people's state--

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:10%
really impacts our organs.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It removes blood flow
from all the vital organs

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
of our bodies-- our stomachs,
our hearts, our brains-- and it

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:90%
puts blood flow in our muscles.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're ready
to fight and flight.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And when they move positive
energy and positive feelings

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:84%
back into their
body, that blood flow

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
starts again to the
vital organs and tissues.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And with it, all the benefits
of bringing in the blood.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Bringing in nutrition.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:90%
Taking away waste.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
Bringing in oxygen, so cells
can metabolize normally again.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're thinking,
what we tend to think,

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.240 align:middle line:84%
how we hold our muscles, where
they are, our whole structure,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
is defined by our
emotional state.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychologists tell us
that 70% of our thoughts are

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:10%
negative and redundant.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:10%
The new biology,
especially epigenetics,

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.707 align:middle line:10%
reveals how our mind and our
perceptions control our genes.

00:17:28.707 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind, which
is the more evolutionary

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
advanced state, is the
creative part of our brain.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, the
subconscious mind,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
while it has some creativity,
is primarily a habit mind.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Nature designed a child's
brain for the first six years

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
to download data about the
community, life in the family,

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and all the principal
rules and organizations

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:90%
that are involved.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, a child's
brain doesn't even

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
express a level of consciousness
as a predominant brain state

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:90%
until after six.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Since our subconscious mind
is a vast storehouse of early

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
learned behavior, it is key
to find ways to access this

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:84%
programming, if we wish to
change our ways of being that

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:90%
no longer serve us.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Many experts have found that
conventional talk therapy

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:90%
has inherent limitations.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:10%
>> The problem with
talk therapy is,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:10%
we tend to continually revisit
the hurts and the pains.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And by constantly
going over them,

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:84%
we're digging deeper
and deeper grooves.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
One has to replace that
negative conditioning

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:90%
with new positive forms.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
We have to substitute
new thoughts, basically.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Hyla Cass is a
psychiatrist and a leading

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:10%
expert in integrative medicine,
and how emotions, stress,

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:10%
and nutrition affect health.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:10%
She was inducted into the
Orthomolecular Medicine

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:10%
Hall of Fame, and is the author
of more than 10 popular books,

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:10%
including "8 Weeks
to Vibrant Health."

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:10%
>> After many years
of medical practice,

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:10%
it's really clear to me that
nature is the best healer.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Medications may
have their place,

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
but really, any
kind of condition,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
let's see how we can affect our
own body and mind ourselves.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Key to a lot of illness,
and that's stress.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:90%
So we have the stresses of life.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.675 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the old stresses,

00:19:17.675 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:84%
the things that are
living in our unconscious

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that we may not
even be aware of.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we address those and
clean them up, boy, are we ever

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
in a better place to go from
the stress response to the relax

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and restore response,
which is what we really

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:90%
need to heal ourselves.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes a lot of
energy to repress memories,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:90%
to repress traumas.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So when we have these
bottled up feelings,

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
they are robbing us
of energy that we

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
could use for our healing, for
our joy, for our creativity.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so important
to find ways, healthy ways,

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:90%
to make other choices.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
We know now that there is no
separation between the brain

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and the immune system.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Every emotion plays an important
physiological role in our body.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Studies of remarkable
recoveries have

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
shown that, so often,
tumor shrinkage is actually

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by a
sudden realization

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that the person is
angry at somebody.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
A sudden permission
to start to have

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
profound emotional expression.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:10%
>> The important understanding
from new science is that

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:10%
our lives are essentially
printout of the subconscious

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:10%
mind, operating 95% of the time.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
desires of people

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:90%
is to change their lives.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the issue about
change becomes critical

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
because the subconscious mind
does not learn in the same way

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:90%
that the conscious mind learns.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind can
learn by reading a book.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:10%
Subconscious mind requires
repeating things over and over

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:10%
again, or getting into a brain
state by which information

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:10%
can be directly downloaded
in the subconscious mind.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So the whole
understanding is this--

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
we need to find ways of
which we can actively

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
engage new programs in
the subconscious mind.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Energy healing, and, really,
touch therapy, can direct--

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
in a very gentle way, can direct
our attention to some very

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:84%
deep, old, suppressed stuff,
so that it begins to come out

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:90%
quite dramatically and subtly.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't even need to go
through all the trauma that

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:90%
caused it.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:84%
They can enter in
a different place.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Not where talk is
initiated, but they

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:84%
can come in through
a different spot

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:90%
in the psychosomatic network.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything's about the
way we're wired up.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:90%
We have choice.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the other
animals, we have choice.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We become what we think.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
We become the energy
field that we create.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
The energy manifests at the
physical level of the body,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:90%
in the blood and the tissues.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Our most recent findings
from quantum physics and from

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the biochemistry of emotions
have given us new insights

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
as to why and how many energy
healing methods work so deeply

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and powerfully.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Using a wide range of
nonverbal energetic practices,

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
they access alternative
pathways to the brain

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:90%
to effect deep healing.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:10%
>> A number of scientists around
the world have been looking

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:10%
at, studying energy healers, to
try to isolate what that energy

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:10%
is that they sent.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And with increase in
electrical energy,

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:90%
there's a surge in voltage.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
There's also a surge
of magnetic energy.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a huge surge in
these biophoton emissions--

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
the current of light
coming from the body--

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:84%
particularly from a
healer's dominant hand.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not talking
about ordinary energy,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
because we know that healing
can occur over vast distances.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So probably what's going on
here is much more complicated.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:84%
There's probably some
sort of quantum effect

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't require
any kind of distance,

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
that can be the same effect
over any kind of distance.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be a combination
of all of the above.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I've done numerous studies
since about 1978 on energy

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:10%
healing.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:10%
And one of the systems
that I've studied

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.460 align:middle line:10%
are cell cultures
in the laboratory.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've found beneficial
effects repeatedly

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:90%
on cells in the lab.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Especially cells
that needed healing.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
That've been damaged by
antibiotics, or temperature

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:90%
shocks.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
When healers placed their
hands on the cultures,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
or nearby, or even in
distant healing cases,

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the cells recovered faster
than the control cultures

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:90%
that were not treated by them.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's a remarkable
effect, because it

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.610 align:middle line:84%
shows that the power
of energy healing

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond the biology of
belief, or a placebo effect.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The fact that cell
cultures can respond

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
means that the
cells in our bodies

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
are also responding
to energy healing.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Not just our minds.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's working at all
the levels of our beings.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The received wisdom in
orthodox medicine is that

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
energy healing has no
evidence and doesn't work.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:84%
There are at least 150
excellent scientific studies

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:90%
of energy healing.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are those
gold standard,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
randomized, double-blind
type studies

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:90%
that are used in science.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And they demonstrate
a very robust effect.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:10%
>> For me, and for most of the
modalities that I have studied,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:10%
which is about 200
different modalities,

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:10%
most healers start with setting
an intention for the highest

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:10%
good of the client.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:84%
A client does not have to
believe in what is happening.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
All he or she has to do is
to express a willingness.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:84%
The healer is like
a garden hose,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and the energy flows through
the healer to the client.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I was called in by one of
my clients for his mother.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:84%
She had had a stroke that
morning, and was dying.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:90%
The whole family was there.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I had the whole
family touch her,

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.505 align:middle line:84%
and then I put one hand
on one side of her head,

00:25:22.505 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:90%
and one hand on the other.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, she had had
a serious stroke,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and the CAT scan showed
that 65% of her brain

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:90%
had been damaged by that stroke.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So I am with my hands like
this, and they got very hot.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And they started to shake.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.424 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't stop the shaking.

00:25:42.424 --> 00:25:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And the heat got very
intense, and I was

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:90%
afraid I was going to burn her.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, after
about 15 minutes of this,

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
she woke up, the paralysis
was completely gone,

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and she was fine.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The biofield can regulate,
because it travels at the speed

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So it totally unifies the
organism into a coherent whole,

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and moves the organism
into a new dynamic mode.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And we call that homeodynamics.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I like to think about the
biofield as an orchestra

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:84%
of different energies,
different frequencies,

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:84%
just like you'd hear,
literally, a symphony.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Complex fields of infrared and
magnetic energy, visible light,

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:84%
bioelectricity,
and probably more.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you may ask,
well, who is the conductor?

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:90%
The mind is.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Where mind goes, energy flows.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And blood and flesh follow.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So the mind is the
supreme conductor

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:84%
of this symphony
of the biofield.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And the biofield literally
moves at the speed of light,

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
because fields do
this, and makes

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
the body a coherent
whole, in response

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:84%
to thought, and in
response to stimuli

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:90%
such as energy medicine.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathy, for example,
can work this fast,

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
by contrast to
pharmaceutical drugs, which

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.380 align:middle line:84%
take time to be metabolized,
and work very slowly.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually working
at a much deeper level

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:90%
in energy medicine.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
We're working at a more
primary level of life

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:90%
that supersedes the physical.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Because the
biofield, in my view,

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is the bottom line regulator
of the physiology and chemistry

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:90%
of the body with the mind.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can work at
that level with our medicine,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.290 align:middle line:84%
then we can shift ourselves,
and self-healing will happen.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:10%
>> There was one study looking
at magnetic energy emanating

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:10%
from one group of healers and
comparing that to the energy

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:10%
emanating from master healers.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the
master healers essentially

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
generated 1/3 more
magnetic energy

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:90%
than the ordinary healers.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> One highly respected
energy healing method featured

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
in the book "The Encyclopedia
of Energy Medicine"

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
is One Light Healing Touch, an
international energy healing

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and mystery school located in
the United States and Germany.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The school was founded by
Ron Lavin, a renowned energy

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:90%
healer and gifted psychic.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
He's also the creator of
"One Light Healing Touch

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Journeys," a CD series of
empowering healing practices.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Ron has been tested,
and was found

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to be running the master
healer energy frequency.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Humankind was truly given
a profound legacy in hands-on

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:10%
healing.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:10%
Today there is a resurgence
of healing all over the world.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:10%
Energy healing is part of
the medicine for an evolving

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:10%
new world.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:10%
I was born clairvoyant,
clairsentient, clairaudient,

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:10%
and claircognizant.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Which means that I could see,
hear, know, and feel the energy

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:90%
of other people and of spirit.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
My life has been about
receiving these messages,

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and understanding what it is
that spirit's guiding me to do.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I saw where people were
holding energy in their bodies

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and would not express what
they were feeling or thinking.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very
painful way for people

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:90%
to move through the world.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I've studied with lamas
and gurus, shamans

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and exceptional teachers of
all kinds, for many years.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
pivotal experience.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I woke up one morning
and had a painful groin.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And realized after seeing a
doctor that I needed a hernia

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.530 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said that for $5,000,
and after four days of rest,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:90%
I would be fine.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if he knew
what was causing the hernia,

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and if he could guarantee me
that it wouldn't come back.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he had
no idea what caused it,

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and he was interested
in taking care of it,

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.950 align:middle line:84%
but that was as
far as he could go.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:10%
And I was studying with a gifted
Masonic teacher at the time.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:10%
And I asked him
about a dream that I

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:10%
had had of sewing up this
hernia with a silver thread.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it
would work perfectly,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and he would hold the energy
for me while I performed this.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And it took 30 seconds, and
I was fine one minute after.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And the dream instructed me to
do this again a couple of days

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:90%
later, to make sure.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And I created a silver
thread, and I sewed it up,

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and I was fine.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I knew and
understood to the core of me

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that my life would be about
doing spiritual and energy

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.140 align:middle line:90%
And that was 30 years ago.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've never had a
return of the hernia.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Lavin has participated in
five remarkable distant healing

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:84%
studies with the National
Institutes of Health,

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
including the landmark study on
AIDS patients conducted by Dr.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Elisabeth Targ.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It was an honor
to be a part of Dr.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Elisabeth Targ's study
on end stage AIDS.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was particularly
pleased and delighted when

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I learned that so many
of the participants

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.450 align:middle line:84%
had a marked decrease in
their secondary diseases.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.850 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most
well-researched studies

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:10%
of distant energy healing
was conducted by the late

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:10%
psychiatrist Dr. Elisabeth Targ.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:46.670 align:middle line:84%
She decided to create a study of
AIDS patients in the late '80s,

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:84%
before all of the medicine
now available to them.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.300 align:middle line:84%
They were in the
last stages of AIDS.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:84%
She gathered together an
eclectic group of 40 healers

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:90%
around America.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:84%
None of the healers had
actually met the people

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:90%
they were going to heal.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:84%
All they received from Elisabeth
was a photo, a T-cell count,

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and a name.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And they also took turns
healing the various patients.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:84%
She had divided
the group in half,

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.940 align:middle line:84%
so that half got the
healing and half didn't.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, she
had had to conclude

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that the patients given healing
were better in every way.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:84%
40% of the patients who were
members of the controlled,

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.750 align:middle line:84%
who did not get the healing,
died by the end of the study.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Whereas all of the
patients who had received

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:84%
the healings were not
only alive, but healthier

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:90%
in every regard.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:90%
They had longer survival.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.420 align:middle line:90%
They had fewer side effects.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
They had fewer
additional illnesses.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:90%
They were improved in every way.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The One Light Healing Touch
school is highly experiential,

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:84%
as the instructors train
students in the use of more

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
than 50 self-healing practices,
including movement, meditation,

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
visualization, sound
work, breath work,

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and sacred ceremony, as well
as 33 advanced energy healing

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
techniques to heal
themselves and others.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And the One Light
Healing Touch students

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:84%
are taught how to access
a high level of energy

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:84%
to affect
transformational healings.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the producer
of this documentary

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:84%
became a practitioner instructor
after experiencing and seeing

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.850 align:middle line:84%
many remarkable
healings from this work.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:34.430 align:middle line:10%
>> During the One Light
Healing Touch school,

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.670 align:middle line:10%
I learned a process called
long distance healing.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was guided to use
it on a family member who

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:90%
was a very difficult person.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And we had been out of
communication, both verbally

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and written, for
a number of years.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Following the healing,
four days later,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I received a note
from this person.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.260 align:middle line:84%
On one sheet of paper were
the words "thank you."

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Clearly the energies
had shifted.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of our students
have reported a wide range

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of physical and
emotional healings.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.719 align:middle line:84%
>> The effects of working with
the school have been dramatic.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:10%
Not only have I been
able to heal myself

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.600 align:middle line:10%
from the bout of
chronic fatigue syndrome

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.630 align:middle line:10%
I had, but I'm also able to
overcome some of the panic

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.300 align:middle line:10%
attack and anxiety
issues I had been dealing

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.340 align:middle line:10%
with since late childhood.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, some
of the other effects

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:84%
were that I feel more
connected, not only to my heart,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:90%
but to my true higher self.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.699 align:middle line:84%
And being more
connected to my heart

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:84%
has helped me through a lot
of difficult times in my life,

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.489 align:middle line:84%
and given me the
guidance to continue

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
reaching for higher levels,
higher goals in my life

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Heart healing remains at the
core of all of our practices,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and all of our spiritual work.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is an essential
aspect of healing.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Especially learning
to forgive ourselves.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:84%
As we begin to
forgive ourselves,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:90%
we then begin to forgive others.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, forgiveness
becomes a full working partner

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:90%
in our relationship with life.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is an
essential piece

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to learn to being at
peace with ourselves

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and to fulfill our
purpose for being.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Working with our techniques
and practices on a daily basis

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:90%
heals the heart.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.030 align:middle line:84%
It releases tension and
stress, brings in light,

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.810 align:middle line:84%
helps us to come into harmony
with our purpose for being.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the One Light Healing
Touch techniques work on deep

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:84%
subconscious levels to
release long-held blockages

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.390 align:middle line:90%
and programming.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.150 align:middle line:84%
This allows students and
clients to experience

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:44.190 align:middle line:84%
transformational
and lasting change.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I came to One Light Healing
Touch after suffering for many

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.060 align:middle line:10%
years with some sadness that I
could not quite put my finger

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:50.860 align:middle line:10%
on.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I had tried talk therapy.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:84%
That didn't seem to
really work, and I was

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:90%
looking for some other answers.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And as I went through the school
and learned the techniques

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and how to release old
programming, what I found

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:90%
was joy.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:08.420 align:middle line:10%
And I continue to use
these practices every day,

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.640 align:middle line:10%
and all my friends
and family have

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.890 align:middle line:10%
seen a huge difference in me.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I have suffered from low
back pain for a number of years.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And during the second
weekend of the training,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
we did a process
where we released

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.880 align:middle line:90%
a lot of emotional issues.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And I felt the shift
in my body after that.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And a week later I went
to my chiropractor,

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and she said that there was an
amazing shift in my pelvic area

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.495 align:middle line:84%
which she couldn't explain, and
I have remained pain free ever

00:36:39.495 --> 00:36:40.295 align:middle line:90%
since.

00:36:40.295 --> 00:36:47.730 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Qigong is another ancient,
powerful self-healing energy

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.620 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It originated in China
more than 5,000 years ago.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, millions worldwide practice
the many different methods

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:03.480 align:middle line:84%
of Qigong that
include exercises,

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.380 align:middle line:84%
breath work, visualizations,
and meditations.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.245 align:middle line:84%
And the latest studies are
showing extraordinary results.

00:37:10.245 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Gary Renza is an
herbalist and writer,

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and is a highly respected
Qigong instructor

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.700 align:middle line:90%
in Cold Spring, New York.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Qigong is a centuries-old
practice whose main purpose is

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:10%
to balance the energy in
and around one's body.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point
in their practice,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.950 align:middle line:84%
one will start to feel
this movement of energy.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And once they feel the
movement of energy,

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
the deep breathing
behind the practice of it

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:45.490 align:middle line:84%
allows the result to get to a
cellular level, for healing,

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:47.639 align:middle line:90%
for the purpose of longevity.

00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The more we can keep
our cells alive,

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the more we keep
our bodies alive.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Ken Cohen from Colorado
is a Qigong master,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and teaches all
aspects of Qigong.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
He is a renowned China
scholar, and is the author

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:84%
of numerous CDs,
DVDs, and books,

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.990 align:middle line:84%
including the internationally
acclaimed "The Way of Qigong."

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Qigong, to me, is very
basic, very down to earth.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing this for about
40-- a little over 40 years.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.144 align:middle line:10%
So when I was first starting,
I said to my teacher,

00:38:18.144 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:10%
"Master Chan, what would you
say is the fundamental reason

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.490 align:middle line:10%
for doing Qigong?"

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Oh, we have
to master the four

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.940 align:middle line:90%
virtues of being a human being.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:32.152 align:middle line:84%
How to lie down, how to sit,
how to stand, how to walk."

00:38:32.152 --> 00:38:37.389 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, we are in such
a fragmented, rushed society

00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're never doing
those things in a way that

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:90%
really brings enjoyment.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.763 align:middle line:84%
One of the consequences of
the quick pace of life today

00:38:44.763 --> 00:38:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of stress that
so many people are under,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:84%
especially racing
against the clock,

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.960 align:middle line:84%
is that the breathing
rate tends to be too fast.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So the average breathing
rate, for example in the US,

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:90%
is about 17 breaths per minute.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.630 align:middle line:84%
If someone is having a problem
with anxiety or even a panic

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:84%
attack, it can go up to
20, 22 breaths per minute.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.120 align:middle line:84%
When you practice Qigong,
within a month of practice,

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
most of my students
are breathing

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.110 align:middle line:90%
at about 7 breaths per minute.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Which is more the optimal rate.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:84%
That means that it takes
less breaths and less effort

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:84%
to drive the necessary
oxygen into your cells.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It also means more
mental clarity.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The brain takes up 2%
of the body's weight,

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:34.480 align:middle line:84%
but requires 20% of the
body's available oxygen.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.210 align:middle line:84%
If you can practice
a technique that

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.540 align:middle line:84%
delivers more
oxygen to the brain

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and that also slows down the
breathing rate so it takes

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.570 align:middle line:84%
less breaths, less effort,
to get that oxygen there,

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.230 align:middle line:84%
there is a dramatic effect
on health and energy.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Biophysicist Dr. Beverly
Rubik found dramatic effects

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.580 align:middle line:84%
in the biofields of
Qigong practitioners.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.975 align:middle line:10%
>> I measured the biofields
of many people who practice

00:40:02.975 --> 00:40:05.590 align:middle line:10%
Qigong, say, in
one Qigong class,

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.440 align:middle line:10%
measuring them before and
after the Qigong class.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And found great improvements
in their biofield.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:84%
More symmetry,
right/left symmetry.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Smoother, brighter expansions
of energy following Qigong.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:25.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Qigong is a wonderful
exercise for balancing

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:10%
and healing the mind,
the body, and the spirit,

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:10%
by way of posture,
breath, and awareness,

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:10%
or the regulation of the mind.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:84%
One student in
particular came to me

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:42.340 align:middle line:84%
with joint pain and the
inability to close her hand.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.310 align:middle line:90%
She also had weak bones.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:84%
After about a year of
dedicated practice,

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
she came back with the
results of her recent tests,

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and her arthritis had diminished
exceedingly, in her hands,

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:84%
especially, and her bone
density came back stronger.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:03.360 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that at least 75%
of all the diseases a person

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:10%
develops as an adult
are not due to genetics.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:10%
Or what the Chinese would call
your original or inherited chi.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Rather, we develop
these diseases

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.370 align:middle line:84%
because of behavioral
choices that

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:22.070 align:middle line:84%
cause either genetic
suppression or expression.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So even if you've had a family
history of three generations

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.630 align:middle line:84%
of breast cancer,
that doesn't mean

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.350 align:middle line:90%
you're doomed to breast cancer.

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.910 align:middle line:84%
If you make a systemic
overall change,

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:37.890 align:middle line:84%
then the chances go more in
your favor of never developing

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that illness, even if there
is the genetic tendency.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I've seen so many
extraordinary benefits

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that Qigong has had on
cancer, on heart disease

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and diabetes, much of
this supported by very

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.100 align:middle line:90%
good published research.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.210 align:middle line:84%
A group of 48 patients with
type 2 diabetes-- adult

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:02.070 align:middle line:84%
onset diabetes-- and they
were all doing Qigong.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:08.880 align:middle line:84%
95% had normalized blood
sugar within one month

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.770 align:middle line:90%
of regular practice.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I've seen similar results among
my own students, some of whom

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.924 align:middle line:84%
were on insulin at the start
of an eight-week program,

00:42:18.924 --> 00:42:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of
the eight weeks,

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.340 align:middle line:84%
with their doctor's permission,
they were off of the insulin.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that there
is something about Qigong

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that increases the insulin
sensitivity of cells.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Which is important
for all of us,

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.190 align:middle line:84%
if we want to have a
healthier metabolism.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:39.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I was diagnosed with
diabetes about six years ago,

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.390 align:middle line:10%
and my blood sugar was 791.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I was on medication
for probably the year,

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and I went to my doctor and
I asked him how long would I

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.381 align:middle line:90%
have to be on medication?

00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, for
the rest your life.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I got serious
about Qigong,

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and I worked at Qigong daily.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I stopped-- I
threw my pills away,

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and I kept monitoring my
sugar-- my blood sugar--

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and I went to my doctor and, you
know, I showed him the numbers.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.723 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're right.

00:43:04.723 --> 00:43:05.860 align:middle line:90%
You don't need it anymore.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been good
for me and it's just

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:90%
health-- better health.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.740 align:middle line:10%
>> When I came to study
with Ken, I was exhausted.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.140 align:middle line:10%
Emotionally exhausted.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Physically exhausted.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.850 align:middle line:84%
To the extent that I would
call chronic fatigue.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Depressed, emotionally.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:84%
From the day I started working
with the primordial Qigong,

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:84%
it was like tapping
into a nurturing

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:90%
force that was everywhere.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.590 align:middle line:84%
My energy level
started to return.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:38.160 align:middle line:84%
My relationships with people
became better, more harmonious.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I was naturally happy
to see my friends.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There is actually a database
available in English that has

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:50.970 align:middle line:84%
over 4,000 abstracts on
Qigong research and clinical

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:90%
application.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So there are many,
many studies that

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.660 align:middle line:84%
have been performed in the
West, including the United

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.375 align:middle line:84%
States and Europe, and
of course in China,

00:44:00.375 --> 00:44:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that really, I think,
prove-- I mean,

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I really think I need to say
this-- that it's not simply

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.100 align:middle line:90%
a hypothesis.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.370 align:middle line:84%
For certain illnesses, for
certain kinds of conditions,

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:84%
there's no longer
a burden of proof.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We can see extraordinary effects
on many disease conditions.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:21.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Ken Cohen has demonstrated
the powerful nature of Qigong

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in many hospital studies
across the country.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:84%
One study found that Ken's brain
waves changed more than 70%

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:84%
while practicing Qigong,
including strong gamma

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.018 align:middle line:84%
waves, which are linked with
the prevention of dementia.

00:44:39.018 --> 00:44:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Ken also practices medical
Qigong, also called Qi Healing,

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.670 align:middle line:84%
which is showing exceptional
results both in China

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.230 align:middle line:90%
and the US.

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called
external Qi Healing.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the healer
uses the energy field

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:00.140 align:middle line:84%
from his or her hands to
affect a new state of balance

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:90%
in the client.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Qigong has a very bright future.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:90%
It's growing really quickly.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:84%
More and more doctors and making
referrals to Qigong and tai

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:16.140 align:middle line:84%
chi practitioners, for patient
education, and for themselves,

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.910 align:middle line:90%
to prevent healer burnout.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're dealing with
patients all day long,

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.260 align:middle line:90%
it's easy to get burned out.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So we need to Qigong
also for the healer,

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.610 align:middle line:90%
to take care of him or herself.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Beverly Rubik
has found that, ideally,

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.850 align:middle line:84%
all energy practitioners need
to take the time to practice,

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the most
beneficial results.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> My research has shown that
it takes many classes to produce

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.770 align:middle line:84%
a lasting change
in the biofield.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:48.430 align:middle line:10%
So whether it's yoga, Qigong,
or visiting an energy healer,

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.390 align:middle line:10%
meditative practices,
all of these

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:54.100 align:middle line:10%
can produce profound
changes in the biofield.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But they need to be
regular practices.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I found a threshold of about
two years of a regular practice

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.430 align:middle line:84%
to make a lasting change
in the energy field.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of the limitations
of conventional therapy,

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.550 align:middle line:84%
some experts in energy medicine
and mind/body techniques have

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.780 align:middle line:84%
searched to find ways to affect
consciousness and deep healing.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.780 align:middle line:84%
One striking example
is mental imagery.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It allows images
to work directly

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.050 align:middle line:90%
on our subconscious mind.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gerry Epstein
of New York City

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:26.810 align:middle line:84%
is a psychiatrist, and a leading
pioneer in mental imagery

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and integrative medicine.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.710 align:middle line:10%
He is the director of
the American Institute

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.530 align:middle line:10%
for Mental Imagery, and
the author of many CD

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:10%
sets and seven books, including
the best seller "Healing

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.490 align:middle line:10%
Visualizations."

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:42.880 align:middle line:10%
>> I came to this work in 1974.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.250 align:middle line:10%
I was a traditional psychiatrist
and a psychoanalyst,

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.520 align:middle line:10%
and I visited Israel.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.900 align:middle line:10%
And by great good
fortune, I was introduced

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.600 align:middle line:10%
to a woman named Colette
Aboulker Muscat, who

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.730 align:middle line:10%
seemed to be getting
and achieving

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.340 align:middle line:10%
greater results in the work that
she was doing, which I never

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:10%
heard of before, called
"mental imagery," than I

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.492 align:middle line:10%
had through my
conventional practice.

00:47:03.492 --> 00:47:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And I became an
apprentice, actually,

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and became her student,
and trained with her

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:10.820 align:middle line:90%
for nine years.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:15.290 align:middle line:84%
This is really the application
of Western spiritual life

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:18.230 align:middle line:90%
into a therapeutic framework.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The range of usage of
mental imagery is unlimited.

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It's used for so many different
kinds of circumstances

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and conditions-- physical,
emotional, social, mental,

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.140 align:middle line:84%
moral-- any kind of
circumstance you can think of,

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.290 align:middle line:90%
it's applicable.

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Mental imagery has a long
and distinguished history.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to ancient Egypt
and the ancient Near East,

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and we call it, in fact,
the hieroglyph of the mind.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And as such, it is the
natural and true language

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.580 align:middle line:90%
of inner life.

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:51.590 align:middle line:10%
And we in turn use it as
a way to direct our being

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:10%
to change, and to heal, and to
shift its direction in life.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.840 align:middle line:10%
This is what the body
responds to-- a response

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.070 align:middle line:10%
to this inner language.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.140 align:middle line:84%
We generally tend
to do it short,

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:84%
because we call it a
homeopathy of the mind.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's a micro input
for a macro output.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:84%
It only takes some seconds--
really, a few seconds

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.960 align:middle line:90%
to maybe up to 20, 30 seconds.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.050 align:middle line:10%
So you do it when you wake up in
the morning to start your day.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You do it at night at
the end of the day.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.740 align:middle line:84%
The way to do the imagery
practice is for 21 days.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:84%
We know that it takes up to
three weeks to change a habit

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:27.980 align:middle line:90%
or break a habit.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It is something
that anyone can do.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Basically, I would say
mental imagery is like having

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:33.890 align:middle line:10%
a treasure chest.

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:37.320 align:middle line:10%
And you can just reach in there
and pull out anything you need,

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.810 align:middle line:10%
and it's all inside of you.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:42.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Mental imagery has allowed me
to learn to live in the present

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:47.270 align:middle line:10%
moment, and not be defined
by my past history.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I work as an artist,
and I've also

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.520 align:middle line:84%
felt that when I come
into the studio now,

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I have a blank canvas, and I
don't bring a lot of baggage

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.710 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have been able
to go into myself

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and find the
beautiful things there

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.570 align:middle line:90%
that I can learn to express.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:07.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I was deeply unhappy.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I'd had my big
disappointment, in the sense

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:10%
that life just wasn't going
the way I wanted it to.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Mental imagery has given
me a way and a direction

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.090 align:middle line:90%
away from that life.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.240 align:middle line:84%
My inner state is-- I
have a lot of fun now.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I basically feel like
I dance through life.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Gerry Epstein's healing
imagery literally saved

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:29.310 align:middle line:90%
the life of patient Greg Moore.

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Just over a year ago, I
had a massive heart attack.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.495 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that I
needed, actually, a new heart.

00:49:35.495 --> 00:49:40.340 align:middle line:10%
So I went on the waiting list
to get a heart transplant, which

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.950 align:middle line:10%
ended up taking 10 months
before I found a suitable donor.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the heart
surgery itself was

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:50.300 align:middle line:84%
a major success, except
three days later there

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.740 align:middle line:84%
was a major complication
with my leg, of all things.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.080 align:middle line:90%
The leg rejected the transplant.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I awoke
from anesthesia,

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:03.620 align:middle line:84%
the doctors were telling me that
it looked like the only option

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:08.390 align:middle line:84%
was going to be amputation,
which was certainly alarming

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:09.230 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, we need to
look at other options,

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:14.930 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not ready
to go that route.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Over that weekend, one of
Gerry Epstein's practitioners

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:24.020 align:middle line:84%
came to visit me and taught
me a few exercises of imagery,

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.590 align:middle line:90%
and I applied them.

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next morning
when I woke up,

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.020 align:middle line:84%
my foot, which I had
had no sensation in

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and could not move
at all, I was moving

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:84%
my toes, just slightly, and
I found sensation in my foot.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I continued the exercises,
and within a few more days

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:50.030 align:middle line:84%
after that, I was walking, much
to the surprise and delight

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:middle line:90%
of my nurses and doctors.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The exercise that I've given
you is one of the exercises

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that we do for nervous
system regeneration.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:02.720 align:middle line:84%
You've actually have
regenerated your nervous system.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.930 align:middle line:10%
And it was shown by the studies
they did on your nerves,

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.420 align:middle line:10%
because they took electrical
studies of your nerves

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:12.050 align:middle line:10%
and your muscles while you were
going through this process.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And where it was
dead to begin with,

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.880 align:middle line:84%
they saw that it
came back to life.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what gave them the
awesome feeling that they'd

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.017 align:middle line:90%
never seen anything like this.

00:51:21.017 --> 00:51:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When I go back
to the hospital now,

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.020 align:middle line:84%
the nurses and doctors are
rather amazed to see me walking

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.790 align:middle line:90%
in without any assistance.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:31.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I can enjoy life
again, and just get back

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:33.895 align:middle line:84%
to normal. (SINGING) Loosen
up and start to limber,

00:51:33.895 --> 00:51:35.851 align:middle line:90%
can't you hear that hot marimba?

00:51:35.851 --> 00:51:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Let yourself go.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big bandleader, and
I feel like I can finally

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.680 align:middle line:90%
get back to living again.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And certainly through Gerry
Epstein's mental imagery,

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:46.447 align:middle line:90%
I can do just that.

00:51:46.447 --> 00:51:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Start living again.
(SINGING) Butcher,

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:52.740 align:middle line:84%
banker, clerk and
grocer, let yourself go.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctor Alan Gass is head of
the heart transplant team that

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.760 align:middle line:90%
worked on Greg Moore.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.600 align:middle line:10%
He is the Medical Director
of Cardiac Transplantation

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.660 align:middle line:10%
and Mechanical Circulatory
Support at Westchester Medical

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.650 align:middle line:10%
Center.

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> After several days
of using imagery,

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Greg was scheduled to
go to the operation,

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.965 align:middle line:84%
probably to have
his leg amputated.

00:52:10.965 --> 00:52:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And when the vascular surgeon
opened up the incision,

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.140 align:middle line:84%
he was amazed at not only the
degree of lack of progression,

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.750 align:middle line:84%
but he actually saw the
muscle becoming pinker,

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and it looked like
it was healing.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was not anything
that we had done.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It was really, I think,
what the imagery had done.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.750 align:middle line:84%
The reason I have so much
confidence in mental imagery

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.930 align:middle line:84%
is because of a personal
experience I had two years ago.

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I was riding my bike
in Central Park,

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and had an accident
with another rider,

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:40.540 align:middle line:90%
and fell and broke my hip.

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to see--
to the emergency room,

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:43.730 align:middle line:90%
they did an x-ray.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I had was a
crush fracture of the hip.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:84%
But also, the neck of
the hip was fractured,

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and there was a gap in the bone.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a millimeter--
close to requiring surgery.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But we opted to do physical
therapy to avoid surgery,

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and then I adopted
mental imagery.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, what my imagery
exercise was, was,

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.510 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever seen a baker's
tool to put icing on a cake

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:84%
where they squeeze out the
icing, I envisioned in my mind

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that that was liquid
bone, and I was putting it

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.070 align:middle line:90%
into that gap in the bone.

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
weeks, my second x-ray

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.330 align:middle line:84%
showed this fluffy
material inside that gap.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And the orthopedic
surgeon was amazed.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that
looks like bone.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And I was not surprised.

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And within two months,
I was back on my bike.

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So I avoided surgery,
and I was back on my bike

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:84%
riding 50 miles within two
months after a hip fracture.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Science is now demonstrating
groundbreaking research

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.350 align:middle line:84%
on the effectiveness
of mental imagery.

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Over the past 40 years,
there's been a wealth

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.730 align:middle line:10%
of experimental research
that's been done on the imagery

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:54.310 align:middle line:10%
process to attest to
its validity and how

00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:57.960 align:middle line:10%
it's so powerful to bring
changes in the human system.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.330 align:middle line:10%
Changes in white blood
cells, changes in hemoglobin,

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:04.350 align:middle line:10%
changes in heart rate--
changes in all different kinds

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.190 align:middle line:10%
of physiological processes.

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I myself have participated
in two studies

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.880 align:middle line:90%
that have demonstrated this.

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect of
the differences

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.860 align:middle line:84%
between the conventional
and the ancient model

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:24.480 align:middle line:84%
is that we look at disease
in an entirely different way.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.660 align:middle line:84%
The ancient system
of health care

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:33.780 align:middle line:84%
always put the sufferer
directly into the position

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.920 align:middle line:84%
of being responsible for his
own or her own condition.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.020 align:middle line:84%
The tools were
given to the person

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.810 align:middle line:84%
to take part actively
in finding their own way

00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:43.920 align:middle line:90%
to their own healing.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.560 align:middle line:84%
The difference between mental
imagery and visualization,

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.860 align:middle line:84%
as I see it, is that
the imagery experience

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.950 align:middle line:90%
is an act of discovery.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:53.380 align:middle line:90%
It resides within us.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a repository of
knowledge that exists for us.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is something
that you conjure up.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.670 align:middle line:84%
A goal that you intend about
something known to you.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have a certain
result in mind,

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.250 align:middle line:84%
such as athletes who
use it all the time.

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:11.130 align:middle line:84%
They use it in baseball,
and golf, and skiing,

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the whole
course as you're going downhill,

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can visualize it, so you
get yourself into an experience

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.650 align:middle line:84%
where you're getting
to an outcome

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that you are
intending to manifest.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for the image, it's a
spontaneous act of discovery

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.460 align:middle line:84%
where you don't know what you
are going to come up with.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And then opens a door for
you, because it gives you

00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:38.700 align:middle line:84%
an insight and understanding
about your life.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Something unexpected
and spontaneous.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And you have the power
within you to do that.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:48.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to depend on
something outside of yourself.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, with the dawning of
explosive new discoveries

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:56.080 align:middle line:84%
in quantum physics, genetics,
and the human energy field,

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.120 align:middle line:84%
we are seeing momentous changes
in the way we approach health

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.840 align:middle line:90%
care.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Countless studies are revealing
the remarkable effectiveness

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.930 align:middle line:90%
of energy medicine.

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:09.530 align:middle line:84%
People the world over are now
using powerful energy healing

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and mind/body techniques
for their own health care

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.650 align:middle line:84%
to help achieve optimum
health, and to bring

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:20.570 align:middle line:84%
through the higher vibratory
energies of balance and peace.

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:24.350 align:middle line:84%
As this empowering wave
ripples throughout our world,

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:27.860 align:middle line:84%
it creates transformational
shifts in consciousness,

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and contributes to the
evolution of humanity.

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> With energy medicine, we're
really touching the closest

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:37.260 align:middle line:90%
thing to the soul.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.330 align:middle line:90%
The spirit of humanity.

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:43.200 align:middle line:84%
There's something much bigger
that this interest and rise

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.840 align:middle line:84%
in energy medicine
is contributing to.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I see the next step for
evolution of humanity

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is to really open up to using
their minds more powerfully,

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.350 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the power
of positive thinking.

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:58.050 align:middle line:90%
The power of positive energy.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:01.240 align:middle line:84%
If we want to establish
a more positive future,

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:05.490 align:middle line:84%
then we need to start
visualizing and intending

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:middle line:90%
that future together.
