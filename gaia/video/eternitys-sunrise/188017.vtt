>> Well, I have found being on
this earth the most incredible

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:10%
adventure.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I've loved every minute of
it, and I often get curious

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that there's so
much complaint going

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:90%
on when we're given so much.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
That sounds la-di-dah, and so
on, but it's really the truth.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:10%
So I write books
about it because I'm

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:10%
trying to get certain
points across,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:10%
and I really didn't start
that until quite late--

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:10%
book writing.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:10%
I had really a happy childhood,
and I was given free reign,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:10%
and I used to
spend a lot of time

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:10%
up on a place called
Dorchester Hill.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm all by myself, and
I had a nice, nice childhood.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But when I was seven,
they sent me to school,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:90%
said I had to go to school.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And the first day in
school was a nightmare

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
because the teacher punished the
boy in front of me-- not me--

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%
but I was the teacher's pet.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And a terrible thing
happened, I thought,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to the little boy
in front of me,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
who pulled a little
girl's pigtails.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher did so
many awful things to him

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and finally had gagged
him and struck him

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
in the knee hole
of her desk tied up

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the day.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And I went home, and I said, I
will never go back there again.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And my older brother said,
if you don't go to school,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
they'll put you in jail.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And this great rage
filled me, and I came out

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
with this statement--
but I own myself.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't own me.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So I proceeded to be
a very bad student.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I skipped school constantly,
and I would actually

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
hide out in places where
they couldn't find me.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I've never quite forgotten
that and my protest

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
that I owned myself,
and I think that's been

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
one of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a pretense
or anything else.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way it was
and has been all my life.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most miserable
times of my life and his was

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:10%
when he had to go to school.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:10%
If I had just been
allowed, and he had just

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:10%
been allowed at the
age of five or six

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:10%
to continue on the visionary
path that every child has,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:10%
it would have made
a big difference.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And Joe-- Joe refused
to cave, you know?

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I caved over and over again
because I felt that's what I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
had to do in order to
survive, and Joe didn't.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so Joe was always
my example of what

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
it's like when you
live into your heart,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
live into the beauty
that you see in life.

>> Education of children
has been a terrible thing,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
but it's given us what
the culture wants,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:84%
not what the human really
needs, but what a culture based

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
on our whole economic system,
our whole economic structure.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
If it's good for business--
what is the old saying?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:84%
If it's good for General
Motors, it's good for whatever.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And anything that gets in
the way of that slavish--

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just this
real enslavement

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.745 align:middle line:84%
by an economic
system, as we have.

00:05:01.745 --> 00:05:04.126 align:middle line:84%
If anything gets
in its way, it's

00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:84%
going to be removed,
if possible.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:90%

Rudolf Steiner-- I consider
one of the great geniuses

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:10%
of the last six centuries.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Steiner had it
really figured out.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:10%
Waldorf education-- it's called
Waldorf because a tobacco

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:10%
company asked Steiner,
would he set up

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:10%
an education system for
the children of the workers

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:10%
in the tobacco company?

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle line:10%
There's something really
hilarious about that whole

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:10%
back and forth.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted their
children to have something

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:90%
better than they had had.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And so Rudolf Steiner
came up with what we now

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
call Waldorf education.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who has ever really
gone into Waldorf education

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
sits back just simply amazed
at the incredible capacity

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
of the three or
four-year-old child

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to move for their own
well-being at all times.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:10%
They're always moving
for their well-being.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And Steiner's Waldorf
school was where

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:10%
that could be nurtured
fully and completely.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And if Waldorf
schools had really

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:10%
spread over the whole world--

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm serious-- I think it
changed just about everything.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:10%
In about 1920, when--

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:10%
Steiner, I think, left in '23.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:10%
About that time,
the earliest Nazis

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:10%
had begun to move as
a party in Germany.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's rumored-- someone
thinks that possibly they

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:10%
poisoned Steiner because
he died very mysteriously--

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:10%
because he was in the way.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:10%
And one of the first
things the Nazis did

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:10%
when they took over Germany was
to seize all of the information

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:10%
centers--

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:10%
radio, newspapers, and so on.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
This is when the Nazis
took over fully--

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:90%
the Hitler business.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But above all, they stopped all
Waldorf education in Germany,

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and it was red-hot in Germany.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was trying to get
their child in a Waldorf

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:90%
school.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And here, all of a sudden,
this newcomer, this Hitler

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:90%
closes them all down.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, why did
you pick on Waldorf schools

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:90%
and close them down?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said because
I want children

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:84%
trained from the
beginning to obey.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.985 align:middle line:90%
Waldorf teaches them to think.

00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:18.550 align:middle line:10%
And so there we have this
marvelously clear insight

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:10%
into the two forces that are
still operating in the world

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:10%
today as it was then.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.150 align:middle line:84%
These are those
that want control

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
and to be the head
of the control,

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:84%
the master of the
control, and those

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.009 align:middle line:84%
who want the true unfolding
of human intelligence.

childbirth was profound on me.

My mother had
hospital childbirth,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:10%
and I hadn't really thought
about any other way of doing it

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:10%
till I met Joe and met all these
people that Joe knew and heard

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:10%
Joe talking about
natural childbirth.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:10%
And I, thinking about it--

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to
go to a hospital.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to have my
baby naturally.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to have it
in my own home.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to be in
control of my birth.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:10%
So his whole
attitude on all that

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:10%
just opened a whole
new world for me.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:10%
It was amazing.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm very grateful for
that, very grateful,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:10%
indeed, because it
was a beautiful birth.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have missed
that for anything.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:84%
That birth was a profound
experience for me

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and something I've
never quite experienced.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd say birth and death
are two of the most

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
profound experiences you
can have in a lifetime--

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:90%
physical experiences.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:10%
So women are lucky in a way that
they can have that experience

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:10%
because it's a tying
to the Mother Earth

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:10%
that you get in no other way.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.435 align:middle line:90%
That's just incredible.

being what my parents thought I

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:10%
should be.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:10%
They didn't try to project
ideas onto me of something

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:10%
to live up to.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
allowed to be myself

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and to find what it is
that I wanted to do.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think I still have that
inner sense of me and a sense

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of self-directedness
and a sense of--

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
also, a sense of connection with
myself and the world around me,

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:90%
particularly the natural world.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that I can always turn to.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I guess-- I guess one
way I could sum up

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that benefit of
being raised that way

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of inner
authority that I feel,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.473 align:middle line:84%
and that I don't need to look
outside of myself to find that.

00:11:26.473 --> 00:11:30.212 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe was very
concerned about children.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.087 align:middle line:84%
His book The Magical Child
was absolutely brilliant.

00:11:34.087 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:10%
It influenced the way that
Louise and I raised our kids.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:10%
And the idea-- you know,
Horace Mann in the 1880s,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:10%
the father of modern education,
or arguably 70, 80, 90, 100

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:10%
years before him, Queen
Theresa in Austria who

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:10%
started the first
[? Spinnenschulen, ?] where

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:10%
the children would work
half the day spinning cloth,

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:10%
and the other half of the day,
they'd get a free education.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:10%
And that was the trade-out that
they made with the peasants,

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:10%
and that was arguably the very
beginning of public education.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And then Horace Mann
industrialized it here

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And in both cases, it was
to turn children basically

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:84%
into machines for
the industrial state.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.427 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.427 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:10%
>> An old friend of mine--

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:10%
I met her in England years ago.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:10%
The famous Jean Liedloff.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:10%
She had found this group
of people in the forest,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.230 align:middle line:10%
living in this forest
in South America, who

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:10%
had never had any interaction
with an outside person at all.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:10%
And they lived a
beautiful life in which

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:10%
the correction of the
behaviors of a child

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:10%
had never taken place.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:10%
And that was the one
thing that they could not

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:10%
understand about her,
Jean, just going to visit,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:10%
was that she couldn't understand
that the infant, from the time

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:10%
it's born on, functions under
a beautiful relationship

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:10%
with the world--

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:10%
that she's lost it entirely,
and the rest of us have lost.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But from the very beginning,
one of the first things that

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.585 align:middle line:84%
ever attracted Jean
was she was visiting

00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
with this little village, and
they had a great, deep hole

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
in the center of it where
they got the best clay

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
to make their pottery from.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very deep hole
and had a ladder going down

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:90%
where they could get to it.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And she saw this tiny little
toddler toddling over next

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to this great big hole,
right on the edge of it.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:10%
And she screamed out.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:84%
No one in that such society
ever raised their voice

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:90%
for anything.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:10%
So the whole village stopped
to see what their visitor was

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:10%
screaming about.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:10%
And she said, well,
that child is going

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:10%
to fall in that terrible cliff.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And their question
was, but why would

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that infant want to
fall in that hole?

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's simply something
she had never thought about.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:10%
The little nursing
babies who were--

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:10%
they had real sharp knives--

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:10%
and who would play with
a sharp knife right

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:10%
when they were at
their mother's breast.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:10%
And Jean shouted out again, oh,
that child will hurt his mother

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:10%
with that knife.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:10%
And the question she got
back was, but why would

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.530 align:middle line:10%
a child want to
hurt his own mother?

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:10%
With that kind of an
answer right and left,

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:10%
she discovered that a child
born into that world--

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:27.390 align:middle line:10%
if nurtured and not
interfered with--

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:33.405 align:middle line:10%
had this remarkable intelligence
for responding exactly the way

00:15:33.405 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:10%
they needed to get along in
the world very beautifully,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:10%
and that we lose that through
teaching children to behave.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] and beyond that,
I could go on and on.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:90%
But Jean Liedloff is--

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:90%
along with Robert Wolff--

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
two people I would
suggest to anyone to read.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Robert Wolff wrote a
book, Original Wisdom.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:10%
If anyone would read that
and catch on to what Wolff

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:10%
is saying, it would change--

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:10%
and would accept it--

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:10%
it would just change everything.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:22.125 align:middle line:84%
He was a Dutchman, sent
by the Dutch government

00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:90%
to the Malaysian people.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And while there, he found
these remarkable people

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:90%
called the Senoi--

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:84%
S-E-G-N-O-I-A,
something like that.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:10%
When he was with the Senoi,
which took him a long time

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:10%
to win a place with them and
for them to recognize him--

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:10%
when he was with this group
of forest people, the forest

00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:10%
itself was quite different when
they were with him and showing

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:10%
him than without them.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they
influenced their environment

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:10%
and lived in their environment
that they were creating.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:84%
He experienced true divinity,
true heaven kind of a thing.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:10%
And when a friend of
mine, Thom Hartmann

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:10%
found Wolff still alive
way up in his 90's he

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:10%
had retired to Hawaii
because the climate was

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:10%
most in keeping with his needs.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:10%
All Wolff could say
when Hartmann asked him

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:10%
about his experience--

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:10%
he had written a
diary, by the way,

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:10%
and Hartmann found the diary,
and he had gone and sought

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:10%
out where Wolff was, even
now, way up in his 90s,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:10%
and was interviewing--
that's how this came about.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And all Wolff could say, we
have no idea what we have lost.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:10%
And I think that that's the
thing that just kind of blows

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:10%
me out of orbit occasionally.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:10%
We have no idea of
what we've lost.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:10%
Just as we're talking about
there are new sciences and all

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:10%
the things they can do, and we
can blow up the whole world.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And we can trace the universe
and all this nonsense.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And the people suffer.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:10%
>> When Robert Wolff said, we
have no idea what we have lost,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:10%
he was--

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:10%
he was talking about the essence
of what it is to be human,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:10%
the original title of his book.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
What it is to love each
other, to care for each other,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
to be part of nature, to be
interpenetrated by nature,

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:90%
to realize that we're--

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
it's a terrible cliche,
but that we're all one--

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and not just all
of us, everything--

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's all one
thing, and that there

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
is a depth and a
beauty to all of this,

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and that one of the most
powerful forces in the world

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:90%
is love.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, love and
light, and not in some kind

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:90%
of new age, cliched way.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:84%
This was just
fundamental right down--

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, met these people,
lived with these people,

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:84%
knew these people,
learned their language,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
slept in their villages,
dreamed their dreams,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and changed my life
as a result of it.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
That was Robert Wolff's
story, essentially,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and it was such a
meaningful story.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it
touched me deeply,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and I know it touched
Joe deeply as well.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe and I met in the
early summer of 1969.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I had just graduated
from college,

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and I was interviewing for
my first job as a teacher--

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
music teacher-- in
Western Massachusetts.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And Joe was also a music
teacher at the time.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:10%
When he wrote Crack
in the Cosmic Egg,

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:10%
that's when I first knew him--

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:10%
his first book.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And he was still teaching
school at the time.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
He taught maybe two or
three years after that,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and then there came
a point that he just

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
wanted to follow his
path, or his dharma,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and write about
what he felt inside.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And all the ideas he had,
he wanted to express them.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point, he
said he was never going

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:90%
to work for anybody again.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
do his own thing.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:84%
He was probably in his mid 40s
by then, maybe mid to late 40s.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And yes, things
changed at that point.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And he started, especially
when Magical Child came out,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.530 align:middle line:84%
he really started
lecturing a lot.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
He had a lecture
person that arranged

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:90%
lectures all over the country.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he
did from then on.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
He wrote, and he lectured
for the rest of his life.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:90%
That was his only focus.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:84%
He didn't care about how people
saw him or thought about him.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to get his
ideas across to his audience.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe liked to be
kind of anonymous.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:10%
He liked to-- he liked for
people to pay attention

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:10%
to what it was he was saying.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:84%
He didn't like for
people to pay attention

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:90%
to who he was as a person.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
important thing for him--

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't out there to
present an ego personality

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:90%
for people to remember.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:84%
He was out there to say
things that he really

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:90%
felt were true and important.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that
it's those things

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that he said that he
wants people to remember.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We dramatically influence
the kind of experience

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:90%
we're having.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thinks that all
of this is happening to me,

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and that's not the case.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It's what we are doing, and
it's reflected back to us.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:10%
We're each responsible
for what kind of forest

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:10%
we're going through, whether
it's a beautiful place

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:10%
or whether it's a nightmare.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.070 align:middle line:84%
The majority of us are
in constant conflict

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves over survival.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Survival takes--
that's number one.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have other
things we want to do,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
but if it's against the
survival impulse in us,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:90%
we go for the survival.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt of that.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I had discovered-- and
it really, really was true--

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that I
couldn't be burned,

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:90%
at least not by cigarettes.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was in my first and
only year, semester in college.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the college
dormitory, and a bunch of us

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and I discovered that
I couldn't be burned.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And I used up a whole
package of Pall Malls,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
those great, big, huge, fat,
thick, heavy cigarettes--

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
whole batch of them, getting
them going full blast

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and showing the
boys at the table

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't be
burned with them.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I was finally putting
them out on my eyelid.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I tried to keep my eye open,
but I couldn't-- reflex was too

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.740 align:middle line:90%
strong to protect my eye.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:10%
And my lips--

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:10%
I finally had gotten three
or four I'm going at once

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:10%
and reversed them and put the
hot end in between my lips

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:10%
and blew sparks
all over everybody.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:10%
I was having a ball.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:10%
My roommate was terribly
upset because he said,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:10%
you'll be sorry tomorrow.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:10%
And I'll never forget
the next morning,

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:10%
he couldn't wait to look at me
to see how badly burned I was--

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:10%
no trace at all.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:10%
And I told him--

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:10%
I said, but I knew
there could not be.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And out of that, I
really developed this

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:90%
to a pretty good extent--

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:90%
unconflicted behavior.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:10%
So long as my system
has no conflict--

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:10%
one part of me saying do, the
other part say don't, and all

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:10%
of us know that--

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:10%
oh, should I buy that, well,
we wrestled back and forth

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:10%
between whether
we should or not.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Or should we attempt
this venture or not?

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:90%
We debate these back and forth.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:10%
And unconflicted behaviors--
when all conflict is gone--

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:10%
and at that point, you can do
anything you take a notion.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
went up to the cliff

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:90%
at Palos Verdes in California.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:10%
It's the highest cliff on
that coastline, I guess.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:10%
And I went up, and it started
just collapsing underneath me

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.700 align:middle line:10%
and dumped me right
back down on the ground.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a rotten cliff.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a stable
rock in the whole place.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's when all
of a sudden, this

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.070 align:middle line:84%
unconflicted behavior,
which I'd been playing

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:84%
with for a long time,
I just turned it over

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
to that unconflicted behavior,
and I went up that cliff.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And the thing collapsed under
me every step of the way I took.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
came to the place

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
where there was the
overhang, that overhang

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:90%
was at least 20 feet in all.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:10%
There was hanging just by
the roots, and I went up,

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:36.648 align:middle line:10%
and I suddenly knew only because
I was reaching for something.

00:26:36.648 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:10%
There was nothing there,
and I looked down.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:10%
There was nothing below me.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:10%
I was on that overhang.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:10%
And this tremendous
elation began to fill me,

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:10%
and I went the whole
distance unable to see

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:10%
where I was going, just
feeling with my hands

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:10%
and moving accordingly.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:10%
And I moved that whole
distance of about 20 feet

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:10%
in thin air, touching rocks and
stuff that immediately fell out

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.840 align:middle line:10%
from under me.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But I knew inside me, I
could not possibly be hurt.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, those are
things you're adding afterward.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:84%
They're the reason I got
out of that not only alive,

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:90%
but elated.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
got to the top,

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:84%
the group I had been
having a picnic with

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:84%
had moved over to
that very area.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And I popped up over the edge,
and it was an impossible thing.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't just materialize
out of thin air like that.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But the elation in me, this
huge exhilaration filled me.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:57.030 align:middle line:10%
And I started pounding
my chest and screaming.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:10%
They said I screamed with this--

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.080 align:middle line:10%
they thought I
had gone delirious

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.440 align:middle line:10%
with the ecstasy which
I felt over that.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I felt is that I
had taken death into myself

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and had conquered it.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Talk about romantic, adolescent
stuff, but I had taken death,

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I had accepted it, and
I had conquered it,

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and it would change everything.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:90%
From that point on, I would--

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:84%
nothing could ever
be the same again.

a very spiritual person.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.190 align:middle line:10%
He's always had tremendous
inner experiences.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.320 align:middle line:10%
We were in Siddah Yoga a little
over 10 years, went to India

many times in the winter, spent

where you do work for the yoga.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the first things I
ever found when I went to visit

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:10%
this meditation master in India
by the name of Muktananda --

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:10%
he was very famous,
and rightly so

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:10%
because he is a
very remarkable man.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.030 align:middle line:10%
But one of the things he--

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:10%
the first thing, I think,
he said to me was--

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:10%
he had to speak
to an interpreter

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:10%
because he didn't speak English.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.950 align:middle line:10%
He said, the heart--

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.590 align:middle line:10%
and right out of
the clear blue sky,

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.140 align:middle line:10%
he didn't know anything
about me except for I

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:10%
came with my family there--

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:19.730 align:middle line:10%
is that the heart is the
source of everything,

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:10%
and there is only one heart.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:10%
He said the heart
beating in my chest

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:10%
is the same as the one
beating in your chest

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:10%
and everyone's chest.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:90%
And the heart is God.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:10%
The heart is the creator.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The heart is the
source of everything,

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and there's only one of those.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:51.950 align:middle line:10%
And once one understands that
there is only one heart, that

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:10%
is repeated in every
single human, the same one,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.920 align:middle line:10%
but always purely
individual, how

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.390 align:middle line:10%
can we be purely individual
and universal at the same time?

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.670 align:middle line:10%
That's the great mystery.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.470 align:middle line:10%
It really is.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:10%
But understanding that,
then you never again

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:10%

It was as though my heart had
spoken it very clearly to me,

I think we were generally
up about a quarter of 3:00

in the morning to be
over at the shrine

and came from my heart.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean, an actual voice from my
heart, directly from my heart.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:10%
And it was a tremendous
experience from me.

And this will sound
awfully la-di-dah,

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:06.580 align:middle line:10%
but to me, in that
particular state,

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:10%
it was the voice of Jesus.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:10%
And I had never been
a Jesus fanatic,

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:17.410 align:middle line:10%
but it was the voice of Jesus
telling me exactly what to do.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around, and I
did exactly what it said.

And for about a half
hour, this great shower

And I went into this
remarkable state of bliss.

And what all that
leads to is too long.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:44.920 align:middle line:10%
But it's typical of,
again, these capacities

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:51.370 align:middle line:10%
we have within us that are not
in keeping with our culture.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:10%

culture, what are you called?

But when all you're doing

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.670 align:middle line:10%

do we get to heaven?

and the goats are going to hell.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And I will say to the sheep,
you know, when I was thirsty,

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:90%
you gave me water.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was hungry,
you gave me food.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.770 align:middle line:84%

you came and visited me.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.060 align:middle line:90%
When I was sick, you healed me.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.435 align:middle line:84%

you clothed me.

When I was in jail--

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I think I said
that-- visited me.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Basically, and I went
with through the list.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, and
I'll say to the goats,

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.380 align:middle line:84%
you didn't do those
things, so off you go.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.030 align:middle line:90%
And at that point--

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, this seems like a
good story up to that point.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
though, the disciples

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.850 align:middle line:84%
freak out because they've
never seen him hungry.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:90%
They've never seen him thirsty.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:84%
They've never seen
him in prison.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:90%
They've never seen him naked.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So you know, homeless,
or clothesless.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:17.407 align:middle line:84%
And so they say to him,
oh my God, you know,

00:40:17.407 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:84%
we've never seen
you-- you know, we've

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.580 align:middle line:84%
never been able to do
these things for you.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.163 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
make it to heaven?

We're screwed.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as you do
it to the least among us,

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:90%
you've done it to me.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:33.798 align:middle line:84%
And that's the essential
message of an ancient culture.

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the
Sermon on the Mount,

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.150 align:middle line:84%
he talked about the
least shall be first.

That's the essential message
of the ancient cultures.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
message that we need

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to be integrating
into our culture,

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and there's 100,000 churches
probably within 1,000 miles

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:84%

Jesus right now

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and don't understand that
core message because it's been

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:90%
so polluted by our culture.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.470 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe was really important
for me in 1996 when I left this

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
church and, in many ways,
left ministry for a while.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a period in my
life from which I really

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.050 align:middle line:84%
had to seek some
kind of guidance

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't get in a
religious setting anymore.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything comes from this
spontaneous experience

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:32.250 align:middle line:84%
of transmission
that was his life.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Every time I would
go to visit him,

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:84%
he would be usually sitting
on his porch somewhere,

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and he just would be looking
at the trees outside his porch.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was watching
them just move

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and saying to me how wonderful
that was that all of this

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.410 align:middle line:84%
was going on, that
all of these trees

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.300 align:middle line:84%
were trying to
communicate with him.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't saying it in a way
was kind of crazy or offbeat,

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:04.020 align:middle line:84%
but he was saying it in a
way in which we felt together

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the connectedness that he had
with nature through his heart.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:84%
He just-- that's the way
he saw what was going on.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's how he--

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.427 align:middle line:84%
that's how he transmitted
himself to everything

00:42:15.427 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:90%
that was around him.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.110 align:middle line:10%
>> We can send rockets to
the stars, practically.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.030 align:middle line:10%
We have these
powerful automobiles.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:29.940 align:middle line:10%
We've got a tremendous medical
system and all the great things

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.350 align:middle line:10%
that science gives us.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:10%
And the only problem is no
one ever experiences bliss

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:10%
in that state.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.500 align:middle line:10%
They're all too busy
manipulating the world,

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.800 align:middle line:10%
trying to get what
they want from it.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:58.610 align:middle line:10%
I could go on now all day
on how we have messed up

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.910 align:middle line:10%
our true inheritance
of who the human is

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:07.260 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of cultural controls

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most corrosive
parts of our culture is

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:17.180 align:middle line:10%
the emphasis on competition,
this Darwinian idea that

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.470 align:middle line:10%
Spencer--

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.826 align:middle line:10%
was it Richard Spencer, I think?

00:43:20.826 --> 00:43:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I forget his first name,
but he was Darwin's cousin.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And he was an economist, and
he basically promoted the idea

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that there was an economic
version of Darwinism, which

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.640 align:middle line:84%
is really how we
understand Darwinism now,

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and which is a complete
misunderstanding, frankly,

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.220 align:middle line:90%
of much of what Darwin wrote.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.925 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, it's completely
infiltrated our culture,

00:43:42.925 --> 00:43:44.550 align:middle line:84%
right down to the
level of our schools,

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.420 align:middle line:84%
where we're pitting our
children against each other

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.600 align:middle line:84%
in this competitive way and
making some feel like failures

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and making others feel like,
you know, little Donald Trumps--

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, little kings,
little emperor kings.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And then that dysfunction then
echoes through their lives

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and echoes through our
culture, and it just

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:90%
continues on and on.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Collaboration and cooperation
are really the way of nature.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, in fact, look
at your body, for example.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.570 align:middle line:84%
If one cell in your
body decided hey,

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm not getting
my fair share of nutrients.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I want the nutrients
of that cell

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and that cell and
that cell, and I'm

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:24.410 align:middle line:90%
going to start taking those.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And so it just started
taking the nutrients

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.360 align:middle line:84%
from all those cells and started
dividing faster and faster

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:90%
and faster.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a name for
that in biology.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's called cancer, and that is
what we're teaching our kids.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
teaching our society.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the basis
of our culture--

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.450 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we have now
become the cancer of the planet.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.580 align:middle line:84%
It's seven billion
people on planet Earth.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.220 align:middle line:84%
We're using more than 50% of
the net photosynthetic output

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.280 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.850 align:middle line:84%
We're using more than half of
all the fresh water on Earth.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:59.950 align:middle line:90%
We're despoiling the atmosphere.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We're destroying
species left and right.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:84%
We're destroying ourselves
because of competition

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.030 align:middle line:90%
instead of cooperation.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The way that our
bodies actually work

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is the liver collaborates with
the spleen and with the heart,

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and you know, everything
kind of works together.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And by working together,
by cooperating,

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:84%
you have a living organism
that's functional.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:10%
And societies, the
older societies--

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:28.250 align:middle line:10%
what I refer to as
older cultures--

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:10%
you know, what Robert Wolff
talked about in his books,

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.520 align:middle line:10%
what Joe talked about in Crack,
The Crack in the Cosmic Egg--

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.070 align:middle line:10%
they got it.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:84%
The cooperation, collaboration,
love, bringing people together

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.470 align:middle line:90%
for a common good.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The potlatch
culture, where if you

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:45.740 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have
status in society,

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
you got that status by giving
away more than anybody else

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:90%
did.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.780 align:middle line:84%
That the idea that
leadership, that leadership

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:90%
was actually service.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the most
difficult job was

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to be the chief, the leader
because that was the person who

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.110 align:middle line:84%
actually had the least amount
of power, who was, you know,

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle line:84%
the person who was subordinate
to everybody else in terms

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.450 align:middle line:90%
of making things work.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Most people can't even
imagine societies like this.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You read Peter Farb's book
Man's Rise to Civilization.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's about first contact with
34 different Native American

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.640 align:middle line:84%
tribes back in the 1600s and
early 1700s in North America.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And over and over
and over and over

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:84%
again, you see
these older cultures

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that were entirely
cooperation-based instead

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:31.190 align:middle line:90%
of competition-based.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:34.861 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't stratify,
and they did live in peace.

00:46:34.861 --> 00:46:38.298 align:middle line:90%

>> I know full well that there
have been two or three times

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:07.600 align:middle line:10%
when I left what was thought
of as the living world and have

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.200 align:middle line:10%
experienced other modalities.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.040 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call them
worlds, but other states.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
have happened recently.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:22.880 align:middle line:10%
And I think they've been
happening because it's

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.110 align:middle line:10%
getting closer and closer
to the time I'm going

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.240 align:middle line:10%
to have to leave the world.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.855 align:middle line:10%
And I think that I've
been given the grace--

00:47:29.855 --> 00:47:32.990 align:middle line:10%
if that doesn't
sound too la-di-dah--

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:10%
I've been given the
grace of experiencing

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:42.170 align:middle line:10%
more and more in the
last oh, few months,

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:48.350 align:middle line:10%
more and more states
of being that are

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:53.930 align:middle line:10%
available outside the
body and beyond body.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:58.670 align:middle line:10%
And to me I look out, and I
see the gross suffering that

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.950 align:middle line:10%
goes on, particularly
in children

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:09.860 align:middle line:10%
who are mistreated by their
ignorant and so on parents

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.670 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:90%
How is that?

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a source of great
pain on the one hand,

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.210 align:middle line:90%
and it's certainly real.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Those hungry children
back in the Depression--

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I remember them coming
to the door in droves,

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:90%
begging for food.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.815 align:middle line:90%
That's all very real.

00:48:30.815 --> 00:48:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It's very real what's happening
right now with children all

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.270 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

we exist on levels

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:middle line:10%

last breath, and it was a very--
it was a very profound moment.

it was a very
altering experience.

something that certainly

changed my life forever.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:33.610 align:middle line:84%
the people around him, and one
of the mystical principles,

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:38.350 align:middle line:84%
core mystical principles, is
that if you save one person,

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:39.440 align:middle line:90%
you save the world.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, and Joe didn't
just save one person.

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Joe changed a lot
of people's lives.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.330 align:middle line:90%
He changed your life.

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.720 align:middle line:90%
He changed my life--

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.970 align:middle line:90%
for the better.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:51:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the work
that many of us

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.290 align:middle line:84%
need to be continually
recalibrating our lives around.

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Very, very peaceful here.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It has a nice, nice
feel to it here.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.900 align:middle line:84%
He would have loved this
place, being buried here.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.960 align:middle line:84%
He's planted-- he's
right next to the garden.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:29.170 align:middle line:84%
He always wanted to
be planted and wanted

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.130 align:middle line:90%
to be buried on the property.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:38.120 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> What characteristics or
values did we hold close to his

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:90%
heart?

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Or what was important to him?

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:47.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Honesty in a person.

00:51:47.925 --> 00:51:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Being true to yourself
and following your heart.

00:51:54.710 --> 00:52:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Just following your
path, your dharma was--

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:13.930 align:middle line:84%
no matter what that
was, you needed

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to do that because there were
times in his life, you know,

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.380 align:middle line:90%
he would--

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:25.580 align:middle line:84%
a moment would come up, and
he would have to decide,

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.600 align:middle line:90%
you go this way.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do I put this?

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of will you-- you
know, like Christ asking,

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.170 align:middle line:90%
will you follow me?

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:43.860 align:middle line:84%
There can be no
doubts, no question.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.390 align:middle line:90%
You follow.

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that takes,
whatever you need to do,

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:53.620 align:middle line:84%
you follow that path
where it takes you.

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.598 align:middle line:84%
Wherever that takes you,
you need to do that,

00:52:55.598 --> 00:52:56.640 align:middle line:90%
and you need to go there.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:02.410 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And he did that.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:90%
He did that in his life.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:10.750 align:middle line:90%
He remained, you know, in that--

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.930 align:middle line:84%
when it came down to it, he
followed where he needed to go,

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and he did what he needed
to do to be true to himself.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:23.540 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:27.340 align:middle line:90%
So he was a great man.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:30.830 align:middle line:90%


00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:31.630 align:middle line:90%
He was a great man.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:00.780 align:middle line:90%
