In bacteria which
caused scarlet fever,

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
she discovered a mechanism
with which the bacteria protect

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
themselves against
viruses, a molecule

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
that functions like
scissors and can cut

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:90%
genetic material precisely--

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:90%
CRISPR.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Charpentier had the idea
of using this molecule

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
to create a universally
usable tool.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:10%
>> What is the most fascinating
is to have had the privilege

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:10%
to identify a mechanism that
is working in so neat fashion

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:10%
in nature.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was obvious
to be able to harness

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:90%
as a powerful technology.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.015 align:middle line:84%
And it shows really the
power of evolution in life.

00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Our genome is rather
like the book of life,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:84%
an incredibly long text
with billions of letters.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes you get typos--

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:90%
mutations.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And they can lead to diseases.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:90%
This is where CRISPR comes in.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
The molecule works like a pair
of scissors with an address

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
label.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It looks for a specific
text, locks on, and cuts

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
out the typo, or
alters the text,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
or inserts something else, more
easily and precisely than ever

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.216 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:09:54.216 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an easy,
programmable system.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:90%
It's more efficient.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's also more versatile.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So one can perform
different types

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:90%
of changes on the genomes.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So for the biologists, this is
really a very powerful tool.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like a Swiss army knife.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Geneticists around the world
are exploring the possibilities

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:90%
of the new tool.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
CRISPR works with plants,
animals, and humans,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and so could fundamentally
change agriculture as well as

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.961 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
For Gavriel and for
many other children

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:84%
with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:84%
CRISPR could be the
salvation because the cause

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of their illness
lies in the genes.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Gavriel's parents
do everything they

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:90%
can to make his life easier.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
They're hopeful and,
at the same time,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.790 align:middle line:84%
anxious about the potential of
the new gene editing technique.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
since the diagnosis,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:84%
there is something
approaching hope,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:90%
a vague prospect of a cure.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Science and technology
has moved at a pace that is

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:90%
unprecedented.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And things that used
to take two years

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:90%
can now be done in six months.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So the progress has
been incredible.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm slowly getting to
a very uneasy point

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.885 align:middle line:84%
where actually this could
impact my own child.

00:11:23.885 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> For Ronald Cohn too, a
treatment for Gavriel is moving

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:90%
within reach.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:84%
In Toronto, he's
conducting research

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:90%
into Gavriel's muscle cells.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The muscle weakness is
caused by a gene which

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
contains the blueprint
for dystrophin,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
a protein that normally
stabilizes the muscles.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
the dystrophin gene is

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:90%
the longest in the human body.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It's made up of two and 1/2
million individual letters.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Two and 1/2 million letters
have lots of room for typos.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Gavriel's mutation is
relatively simple--

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
a certain DNA section occurs
doubled, occurs doubled.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Cohn has programmed
the gene scissors

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.375 align:middle line:90%
to cut out this precise section.

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:18.252 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.252 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We put the CRISPR Cas9
into the cell culture,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:90%
waited about 12 days, I think.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.715 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
these Eureka moments.

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> An initial success.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But a cell culture is
a very different thing

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%
from a human being.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:84%
How would Gabrielle's
already damaged muscles

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:90%
react to the treatment?

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Even the nature of the therapy
is still completely undefined.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty is getting
the CRISPR genetic scissors

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:90%
to the right spot.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Would an injection into
the bloodstream the best?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.095 align:middle line:90%
Or directly into the muscles?

00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And above all, what side
effects might Gavriel face?

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:90%
All this is totally unknown.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:10%
>> If I have a boy who
already sits in a wheelchair,

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:10%
and I know he sits in a
wheelchair because he already

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:10%
has a lot of muscle tissue
replaced by scar and fat

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:10%
tissue, is there still enough
muscle left that any kind

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:10%
of therapy that could target
the muscle would be successful

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:10%
enough to at least keep the
boy at the stage where he is

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:10%
and not have him
progress any further?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be honest, the
answer to this question

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.445 align:middle line:84%
will only come from
clinical trials.

00:13:51.445 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesse Gelsinger was a boy
too when the latest findings

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
of the geneticists gave him
reason for hope 20 years ago.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The fate of the
18-year-old American

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
shows that we must be wary
of expecting too much.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, Jesse was one
of the first patients

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:84%
to be treated with a
pioneering gene therapy.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
He was given an infusion of
genetically-altered virus

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.705 align:middle line:84%
particles in a bid to cure
his metabolic disease.

00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:90%
But his immune system collapsed.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Four days later, Jesse
Gelsinger died, a supposedly

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:90%
unforeseeable accident.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:84%
It only emerged later the
same complications had

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:90%
occurred in animal experiments.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:10%
But no one had drawn the
necessary conclusions in time.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:10%
Jesse's death put a stop to
the development of gene therapy

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:10%
for many years.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Ronald Cohn knows exactly
what happened back then.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's determined not
to repeat the mistake.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.595 align:middle line:84%
>> If something even close
to what happened 20 years ago

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to gene therapy is going
to happen to CRISPR,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:84%
it will again paralyze
the field for years.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.181 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants to
go down that path.

00:15:22.181 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> When is the right
moment to risk a therapy?

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Not before all risks
have been investigated?

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.295 align:middle line:84%
But won't that be
too late for Gavriel?

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:33.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%
For Gavriel's doctors,
it's safety first.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But his condition deteriorates
with every day that passes.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.181 align:middle line:84%
And lost muscle tissue
cannot be replaced.

00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So these are very
crazy scenarios to be in.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
To do nothing isn't
really an option.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And do something comes with
a whole load of excitement

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:90%
and complete fear.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Gavriel's life is not
immediately threatened.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:84%
He has a lot of
things he enjoys.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Would he go along with a
potentially risky gene therapy

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
experiment?

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I would because I'm desperate
to be normal like my friends,

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to be able to just walk out the
house as opposed to you know.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.048 align:middle line:84%
I like to go for a
run with my friends.

00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I like to play football
properly with my friends,

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
not in my wheel chair
because I don't like being

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:90%
the goalkeeper or the referee.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I've seen my friends
are trying to be nice,

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:90%
but that's not how I see it.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.812 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.812 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> But the debate about the
opportunities and the risks

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
of CRISPR in medical research is
broader than whether individual

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.265 align:middle line:84%
patients like Gavriel
could be helped.

00:16:48.265 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
While we are filming
in London, we

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
hear about completely
different experiments

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:90%
involving genome editing.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
In the US, scientists have
changed the genetic material

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:90%
of human embryos.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
And that's a totally
different dimension.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Because when researchers
manipulate these early stages

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
of human life, the
changes will be

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
passed on to all
subsequent descendants.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Mankind is altering
its own germline--

the bond between
the generations.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:84%
The researchers in
the US were trying

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to find a cure for a
hereditary heart disease.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:84%
These experiments took place
only in the cell culture,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.606 align:middle line:84%
And she rejects any intervention
in the human germline.

>> It's an ethical issue.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.425 align:middle line:10%
This is to protect issues

the CRISPR Cas9 technologies

would adhere to for
therapeutic purposes

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:10%
and for research and
development purposes

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:10%

with these experiments.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It seems it's no longer a

Absolutely.

Which is why you need to
regulate this somehow.

plant breeding at Pioneer

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
they're dependent on a few
globally operating companies.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
As farmers, we can't
be neutral to that.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And as consumers, we shouldn't
be neutral to that either.

has principally been employed

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.940 align:middle line:10%

for soybeans and corn,
rapeseed, and cotton,

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.675 align:middle line:10%
the so-called cash crops
that earn companies billions.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Are the new CRISPR plants also
mainly strengthening the power

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:90%
of the multinationals?

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.975 align:middle line:84%
The distrust they're
facing is certainly great.

of Germany's Association
of Organic Food Producers.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
He represents a totally
different approach

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:84%
to agriculture, which rejects
any targeted intervention

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.706 align:middle line:84%
in the genetic
material of plants.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the
tunnel vision concentration

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:90%
on the genome is wrong.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:84%
We must look at the
agro-ecosystem as a whole.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Instead of trying to repair
the system so that we

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:84%
can keep it going with all other
negative effects, for example,

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
on biodiversity,
we would do better

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
to change the system
itself by looking

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.160 align:middle line:84%
at mixed crops for example
and the development of soil

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:90%
fertility.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
That would take us
very much nearer

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to solving the
problems that we're now

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:90%
trying to solve in the genome.

sustainable agriculture

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and CRISPR gene editing
really mutually exclusive?

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Is CRISPR simply
a new instrument

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:84%
in the hands of
the multinationals?

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
At the University of
California in Davis,

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:90%
we meet an unusual couple.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Pamela Ronald is a
plant geneticist.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.125 align:middle line:84%
Her husband, Raoul Adamchak
is an organic farmer.

00:28:08.125 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.380 align:middle line:84%
UC Davis is one of the
world's leading agricultural

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:90%
universities.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Organic farming and
genetic engineering--

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:84%
conflicting fields
you might think.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But they needn't be if
they pursue the same aims.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.815 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.815 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:10%
>> We both have a vision, a very
similar vision for sustainable

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:10%
agriculture and
how the healthiest,

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:10%
most productive food
can be grown in the most

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.180 align:middle line:10%
environmentally friendly way.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's a definite
overlap there.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> On the university farm Raoul
cultivates beans and other

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:84%
vegetables without using
chemical fertilizers

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:90%
or pesticides.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But some problems
are persistent.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Again and again, pests
destroy his crops.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Raoul is one of the few
organic farmers prepared

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to talk in public about how new
plants from the gene laboratory

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.960 align:middle line:90%
could help.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Agriculture needs to use
most advanced technologies along

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
with the best ecological
farming practices.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:28.140 align:middle line:84%
If we can use both our plant
breeding brains and our farming

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
practice brains to put together
a more diverse and more

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.774 align:middle line:84%
productive agriculture, I think
that bodes well for the future.

00:29:39.774 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Pamela Ronald is a geneticist
and has specialized in rice,

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
food crops in the world.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.540 align:middle line:84%
The multinationals are not
very interested in genetically

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:90%
modified rice.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They can't make
much money from it

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's mainly
grown and eaten

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.090 align:middle line:90%
in poor regions of the world.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:10%
>> What I became drawn to
working on agriculture is

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:08.280 align:middle line:10%
to help contribute to an
ecologically based system

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:14.840 align:middle line:10%
of farming and to help nourish
people that don't have much

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.640 align:middle line:10%
to eat.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So there are many people
that lack food security.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:24.072 align:middle line:10%
So those were my major reasons.

00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> She's had great scientific
success using previous genetic

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:90%
engineering methods.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But the work on a new plant
variety was immensely expensive

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.995 align:middle line:90%
and took decades.

00:30:34.995 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So recently, Pamela
Ronald and her colleagues

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.740 align:middle line:84%
have also been concentrating
on CRISPR genome editing.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The researchers hope it will
help them reach their goal more

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:84%
quickly and will make
varieties possible that

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.350 align:middle line:90%
were previously unimaginable.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.435 align:middle line:84%
They aim to develop varieties
that certain pests can't

00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:00.235 align:middle line:90%
damage.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:84%
That would protect crops
and save on pesticides.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
In addition, they want
to modify rice plants

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:84%
to make them better able to
cope with climate change.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing well.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.562 align:middle line:90%
Look at this DNA pattern.

00:31:19.562 --> 00:31:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> A dream would be that
we could use this approach

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
to develop drought-tolerant rice
that could also be applicable

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:90%
to other crops.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:84%
That's a big challenge
in plant biology

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
right now, especially in the
face of the changing climate

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:84%
is to develop crops that are
more resilient to climate

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.272 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:31:41.272 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Her husband is also looking
to the CRISPR technique

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:90%
for help.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:84%
The many discussions
with his wife

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:84%
have rendered the organic
farmer open to something new.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
A root pest is eating his
vegetables, especially

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.732 align:middle line:90%
the squash.

00:31:56.732 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, there's
just nothing there.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.063 align:middle line:84%
>> And that should be
a well-rooted plant.

00:32:01.063 --> 00:32:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But then look, they want
you to pick up the root.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> If the squash grow at
all, they're very small.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
plants that have

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.815 align:middle line:90%
resisted the pest attacks well.

00:32:12.815 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we can find a crop,
identify the resistance

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.550 align:middle line:84%
in another crop, then you could
put the gene into this crop.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.350 align:middle line:90%
That might work.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you saw how the plant
didn't produce a lot of roots.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you
could find some genes

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that would double or
triple or quadruple

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:90%
the amount of roots produced.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And the plant could just outgrow
this [? infantileness ?]..

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The two of them want to
launch a research project

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
on this pest because organic
agriculture has no means

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.740 align:middle line:90%
of combating it.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.665 align:middle line:84%
The toxic substances used
in conventional agriculture

00:32:50.665 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:90%
are taboo for Raoul.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.780 align:middle line:84%
He sees a plant from
the CRISPR laboratory

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.690 align:middle line:90%
as the best solution.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I would plant it.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But the big caveat is would the
USDA National Organic Program

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:90%
allow me to plant it.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So if they can accept
CRISPER-mediated plants,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:90%
then I would plant it.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a no-brainer.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What's so obvious to
Raoul is highly incendiary.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Opposition to
genetic engineering

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.280 align:middle line:84%
is a central pillar
of organic farming.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:84%
We asked Prince
Felix zu Lowenstein

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.518 align:middle line:84%
whether the new CRISPR
technique could change that.

00:33:34.518 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:10%
>> These new genetic techniques
we're talking about share

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:10%
at least one risk with the
old genetic techniques--

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.080 align:middle line:10%
they involve replicable
living organisms,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:10%
which we are releasing into
nature from where we can never

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.340 align:middle line:10%
extract them again.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But hasn't traditional
plant breeding

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.300 align:middle line:84%
been doing the same thing
for thousands of years?

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not only the
CRISPR corn growing

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
in the trial field
in Iowa that's

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
radically different from the
original natural corn plant.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Most corn varieties
were developed

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.219 align:middle line:90%
without genetic engineering.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:84%
Through repeated cross
breeding, they're

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:84%
now far removed from
the original wild plant,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.460 align:middle line:90%
which is also here.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Teosinte is the name of the
wild distant ancestor of corn.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.389 align:middle line:90%
The kernels are tiny.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It's still found in Mexico
and neighboring countries.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.739 align:middle line:84%
Through crossing
and selection, corn

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
has radically changed in the
course of thousands of years.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And the genome of the plant
has been modified completely

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:90%
without genetic engineering.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:84%
So is genetic
engineering nothing

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:84%
other than a form
of plant breeding?

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, not quite.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Because at least with
genetic engineering to date,

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:90%
man has gone one step further.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.510 align:middle line:84%
To genetically modify
corn or other plants,

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:84%
researchers generally
use bacteria

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.700 align:middle line:90%
which contain the desired gene.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The foreign gene is implanted
into the genome of the corn.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.110 align:middle line:84%
A plant modified like
this is called a transgene

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:84%
because it contains
DNA transferred

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:90%
from other organisms.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.666 align:middle line:90%
CRISPR does away with this.

00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:84%
The genetic scissors can
alter the plant's genome

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:90%
without introducing foreign DNA.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:84%
The editing mechanism itself
is then completely removed.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:84%
The resulting corn
plant therefore

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:90%
contains nothing but corn DNA.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
If CRISPR is used
like this, the result

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:84%
is indistinguishable
from a natural mutation.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And genetic engineering,
which can't be detected,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.540 align:middle line:84%
is not genetic engineering,
according to the US authorities

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.026 align:middle line:90%
ruling on Pioneer's waxy corn.

00:36:04.026 --> 00:36:08.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not being regulated
under their biotech framework.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's being
regulated or reviewed

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:10%
as a conventionally-bred
variety.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:23.211 align:middle line:10%
And so it won't be under
a GMO rubric, if you will.

>> A decision with far
reaching consequences.
