00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, the
world is in crisis.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
We have an amazing amount
of chronic disease happening

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:90%
in the planet.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most potent
widespread pandemics

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:90%
that we're facing is diabetes.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
There's 246 million people
today who suffer from diabetes.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a major pandemic
situation that we

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:90%
have to pay attention to.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We are one of the sickest
countries in the world.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:90%
It don't have to be that way.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Type 2 diabetes has tripled
in the last 10 years.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.472 align:middle line:90%
That's a lifestyle disease.

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
That's all about what you're
putting into your mouth.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We have an unbelievable
epidemic of diabetes in this

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:90%
country.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.542 align:middle line:84%
And the rates of diabetes
are skyrocketing.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And it parallels the
epidemic of obesity.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.923 align:middle line:84%
We have the most
overweight population ever

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the human
race and still growing fatter.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.887 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the definition
of insanity is doing the same

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
things over and over and over
and expecting a different

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.570 align:middle line:84%
result. We have to do
something completely different

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.783 align:middle line:90%
and innovative.

00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the ghetto.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:90%
This is Pimlico.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:84%
This is where I used to live
when I was a kid actually.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I used to actually live in
the other building down there,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
but this is where
my sister lives.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:90%
So hopefully, she's in.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.170 align:middle line:90%
This is my sister Nicole.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> How you doing?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm always checking on here
to make sure she's all right.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.822 align:middle line:90%
She's frying nuggets.

00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of grease.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.686 align:middle line:90%
Good lord.

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:16.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Be quiet.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:18.861 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess the most interesting
thing that happened to me

00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
in the last year is being
diagnosed with diabetes.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been having to
go to bathroom a lot,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.457 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't know why.

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the emergency room.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.123 align:middle line:90%
And they checked my blood sugar.

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
They told me that my
blood sugar was at 1,200.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, the normal range for
blood sugar is about 80 to 100.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
So I was far beyond that range.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
When I went in, the doctor
said you should be dead.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't you had a
possibly of dying.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
At 1,200, you should
have something wrong.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Where my pills at?

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.792 align:middle line:84%
I have one aside
for when I'm ready--

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>> --ready to get eating.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I need to get
a refill tomorrow.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I've always dreamed
of living to 102.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.178 align:middle line:90%
That's one of my goals.

00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:55.063 align:middle line:84%
So to hear that
already so young you've

00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
been diagnosed
with something that

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
has a major impact on your
health, it took me for a loop

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and just made me think
that there is so much

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.595 align:middle line:90%
more that I have to do.

00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I shouldn't be thinking that
I have a lot of time to do it.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So my main thing is just
getting back healthy

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and making sure
that I stay healthy.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.114 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it takes
to get that done,

00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:17.524 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to make
that sacrifice.

00:03:17.524 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was growing up, the
Italian people were always

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.750 align:middle line:84%
mangia, mangia,
mangia, eat, eat, eat.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.585 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever they shared
food with their family,

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
it was a very, very
precious thing.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The greatest gift
they could give

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.235 align:middle line:84%
is food to their family
and their friends.

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:39.735 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing that's going
to be advantage and another one

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
is a disadvantage, my
wife is such a good cook.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
She cooks just like
the old country.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And oh my god, Betty
Jean, you outdid yourself.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.136 align:middle line:90%
The lamb is to die for.

00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:50.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:54.417 align:middle line:84%
>> About 10 years ago, I
went to my cardiologist.

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I was having a little
hypertensive problems.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
He goes, eh, you're
borderline diabetes.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the word diabetes,
no idea how devastating

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:90%
this is to life.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The consequences, my god, it
affects every organ system,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and just your vision, your
kidneys, sexual dysfunction.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.105 align:middle line:84%
The other things are the
neuropathy in the feet.

00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:90%
And my feet slowly became numb.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:90%
One day, I got cold and chilled.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:90%
So I grabbed the ceramic heater.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
40 minutes later, I
smell steak cooking.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I try to follow the smell.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:90%
I look down at my foot.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It was boiling and bubbling
and cooking, literally cooking.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I cooked my foot.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I just, I've been a big eater
and no controls on that.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the eating
just pacifies me.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Just it's a wonderful
pacification thing.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>> My grandmother raised me.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
My diet was whatever
I wanted. you know

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And it always
entailed of dessert

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:90%
because that was my reward.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, my
favorite are gyros.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I love gyros.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Come to me, baby.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:90%
I like to eat.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I like to satisfy
whatever I feel.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really have
anyone to push me that much

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I have just so much
that I want to do,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
but I'm being held
back by, first,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:90%
my diabetes and my health.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to lie.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't get this stuff.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:90%
So I have a husband.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:90%
His name is Ernest.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:90%
My son Manny, he's 10.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
The members of my family are
loving and strong and funny.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, diabetes affects
me in a lot of ways.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Physically, I'm not
happy where I am.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.558 align:middle line:90%
I just want to get rid of it.

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:07.366 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Dear Heavenly Father, bless
this food which we are about

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to receive.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:90%
And we thank you for this day.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:90%
And we love you.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And we say this in the
name of Jesus Christ.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I want is
to watch my grandkids.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to see them get big.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And the way I'm going, if I
don't do something about it,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
around to see them.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:90%
And grampa flips that.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.545 align:middle line:84%
Then he puts his finger
up there like that.

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:90%
[SNAP] And that hurt.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And then I squeeze it--

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oooh.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> --so the blood comes out.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And then I put it on here.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the numbers
come up there.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
464.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
That is bad.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Like my doctor told me, my
diabetes is out of line.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:90%
He says you're going to die.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:90%
You're killing yourself.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
He tell me what I had to
do, but I didn't do it.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I take nine other pills
besides my insulin.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I try to watch
what we eat for him.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.338 align:middle line:84%
Because I buried
one, I don't want

00:07:22.338 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:90%
to bury another one right away.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all the things
that you take, man,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:90%
orange juice puts it up there.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Then why do you drink it?

00:07:33.635 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love it.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.545 align:middle line:84%
Nobody likes to be defeated,
especially in their own body.

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> My father was a diabetic.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:90%
My brother is also a diabetic.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and I have a
sister that's diabetic.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
The way we ate may
have contributed.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was just too much.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:90%
So one day, I'm surfing online.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:90%
And I go across Craigslist.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And I find that there's an
advertisement for a Raw for 30

days and reversing diabetes.

00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:57.260 align:middle line:90%
So I figured this had to be it.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.143 align:middle line:84%
I was really, really
open, because, you know,

00:09:59.143 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
my whole thing was I'm not
used to being on insulin.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be on insulin.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was willing
to try something

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:90%
to get me off insulin.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea
what raw food was.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Only nuts, seeds,
and vegetables?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So that was a little
bit of a challenge,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:90%
but I was really open to it.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK, fine.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to bring
you out to Arizona to do

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle line:90%
the raw challenge and so forth.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:84%

to be six of us.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been working in holistic
medicine for 35 years.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And for me, healing diabetes
is actually quite easy.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:90%
This is not a new thing.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.325 align:middle line:84%
With the approach
we use, I want you

00:15:55.325 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
to know that literally
hundreds of people

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.548 align:middle line:90%
have been healed by type 2.

00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with
you in a little bit

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
three cases of type 1
that have also healed.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I saw that what I learned
at Columbia Medical School,

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
which a great medical
school, was symptom focus.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And even though I was really
expert in pharmacology,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
from my biochemistry
background, I saw, wait,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
there's something
not right here.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
How do we go to a
deeper level of healing?

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:84%
That took me into training
people and educating people.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, creating the
Tree of Life Rejuvenation

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Center where we can create an
all-encompassing environment

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:84%
that people could really get
a taste of what it's like

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:90%
to really be healthy.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
One other thing you're going
to learn about live food

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.773 align:middle line:84%
is that's the diet
that works the best.

00:16:43.773 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's the reason?

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Because when you cook the food,
you lose 50% of the protein,

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
70% to 80% of the vitamins and
minerals, and close to 100%

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of the phytonutrients.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask everyone to
cut your insulin intake by 1/3.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:90%
That's our first focus.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
So we have to try real hard.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be aware that's
going to move a little fast.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Our biggest concern,
quite frankly,

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
is people getting the shock from
getting of insulin so quickly.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
We specifically
selected people here

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:84%
who aren't familiar
with this way of life

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:84%
so that we can show
everyone can do this.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:84%
So you play an incredibly
important role,

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.298 align:middle line:90%
not just for yourself.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.465 align:middle line:84%

you're going to inspire.

Yeah?

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.492 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have some
classic burgers.

00:18:12.492 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
our burgers are made

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:90%
with some sort of nut base.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.205 align:middle line:84%
This one happens to be walnuts,
pumpkin seed, sunflower seeds.

00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we usually
throw in some vegetables.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%

and tomatoes.

can eat some sprouts.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.874 align:middle line:90%
Can't complain.

00:22:47.874 --> 00:22:48.674 align:middle line:90%
[BEEP]

00:22:48.674 --> 00:22:50.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:54.141 align:middle line:84%
If I could have that
for the rest of my life,

00:22:54.141 --> 00:22:55.135 align:middle line:90%
would be peaches.

00:22:55.135 --> 00:22:55.935 align:middle line:90%
>> You did good.

00:22:55.935 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And my sugar has been the
highest of everyone here,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
but I know it's
going to go down.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is.

00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:05.656 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to take a little
bit for your body to stabilize

00:23:05.656 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and get used to this.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you not want to see?

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Look how high it is.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:90%
It went up higher.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> 162.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Just be patient with it.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:90%
You're off your medication.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And your body's still
getting acclimated to what

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:90%
we're doing here.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.312 align:middle line:84%
So just write it down on
your sheet and show it--

00:23:25.312 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm going under a rock now.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It'll get better.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:90%
It'll get better.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's a 60-point drop, and
you cut your insulin by a 1/3?

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>> A 1/3.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't take it last night.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's even better.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Michelle, what was
your blood sugar today?

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>> 400.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Be patient, Michelle,
it'll come down, sweetie.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It'll take it's time.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Everybody drops at different
rates everybody's different.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's a little different.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody
is moving very fast.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
something that the "New York

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.438 align:middle line:84%
Times" says is incurable,
everybody here is off insulin.

00:24:25.438 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, you've
cut your insulin in half

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:90%
as a type 1, it's not so bad.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.894 align:middle line:90%
So we have to hold perspective.

00:24:33.894 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Give it a little time.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Detox is very
difficult for people.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to
shift your way of life,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
all of those old patterns
and all of the chemicals

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.085 align:middle line:84%
that are in the cells themselves
that begin to be released,

00:24:49.085 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
a person has to be very
strong, very courageous,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.498 align:middle line:84%
and have strong intention to
move through that process.

00:24:55.498 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
what's wrong with me,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:90%
but I feel really strange.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And I can walk all the time.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.367 align:middle line:84%
My legs I feel like
I'm going all over.

00:25:05.367 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
hell is wrong with me.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:90%
I feel weak.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I could walk this
any other time.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like my body
is going another way.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.015 align:middle line:90%
It's boring in the house.

00:25:18.015 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm bored to death.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I just want this
30 days to be over.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But for me, my physiology,
I need something to eat.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel so inferior
to the people at the house

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:90%
because they're just doing it.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only one that's
like having a hard time.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
This isn't usually
my personality.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not this down.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:90%
But I feel crappy.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I just totally made up my mind
today that I'm going to leave.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not because of
my health issues.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not because of anyone.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I just want to go home.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I can't be away from
my family that long.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:18.348 align:middle line:84%
I'm really sorry that I
disappointed everyone.

00:26:18.348 --> 00:26:21.841 align:middle line:84%
But I have to do
this for myself.

00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:26.332 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.332 --> 00:26:29.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Michelle
going home for sure?

00:26:29.395 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I think she's really,
really missing her family.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And so far, she hasn't really
seen that much progress.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to tell her
that it's only a month.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not that big a deal.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Like why go to all the
hassle when we're almost done

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:90%
with the first week already.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it must be hard, but
you can only imagine how much

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
your family would miss
you if you get sick

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.360 align:middle line:84%
because of diabetes and,
you know, pass away.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.415 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, it's so
much healthier for her.

00:26:59.415 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Like for all of us, like
it's going to be so much

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:90%
better for her in the long run.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Why can't she see that?

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It takes time, you know?

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Five days is, that's
not enough time

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:90%
to give it a chance to work.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.772 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:12.772 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a feeling that
I want to leave too.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would you
want to leave though?

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> My spirit tells me--

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we subconsciously
can deceive ourselves too with

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
fears and emotions that
we don't understand.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
How do you differentiate
between the spirit and--

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Your inner self.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.585 align:middle line:90%
Your inner self [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:38.585 --> 00:27:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I know, but
that's intuition.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.200 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of like intuition.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>> >> Has nothing to
do with intuition.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't understand how you
differentiate that between--

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:90%
You do not understand.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.152 align:middle line:90%
You're Catholic.

00:27:53.152 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, I'm
still a human being.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you have your beliefs.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And I have mine.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the individual thing.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:10.983 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.983 --> 00:28:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I know this is
going to work for you.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.678 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:28:13.678 --> 00:28:14.720 align:middle line:90%
This is really important.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.387 align:middle line:84%
I know this has
probably been a blessing

00:28:16.387 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:90%
that you've been asking for.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know sometimes
things happen, and it just

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
seems like a scaling back, but
we're going to move forward.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> As much as you
believe in God.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:90%
As much as you sang in church.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've
prayed for this.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.385 align:middle line:90%
>> This is why you're here.

00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:90%
This is why we're all here.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:90%
All of us want this change.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You want this thing so bad
you're forgetting what you came

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:84%
here for, not just for you,
but for your children, right?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, yeah, yeah, yeah--

00:28:44.425 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You're darn right.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> --cause I did tell my son, I
said, he didn't want me to go.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
He cried uncontrollably,
inconsolably.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm holding him, and
I'm looking at myself

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.460 align:middle line:90%
in the mirror.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, but baby, you
want a new mommy, don't you?

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.450 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I did.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And it just kills
us to see you leave.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially when we
know you're so capable.

00:29:11.855 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, but I already
made the decision.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.803 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you can't do that.

00:29:15.803 --> 00:29:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I already made up my mind.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know what
a blessing this is?

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> How can you do that?

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't you want to
get through this

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and be the person
you want to be?

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I thank the Lord every
day for being here.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I thank you, dear Lord, to
give me the opportunity.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have

to Chocolate Making 101.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
The most surprising
thing about the recipe

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to prepare
today is how easy it is.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I can prepare this now--

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I've made it enough times--
in about 10 minutes.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.522 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got a
chocolate craving,

00:35:29.522 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:84%
you can make raw
chocolate in 10 minutes.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.050 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty incredible.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:34.640 align:middle line:90%
So the first thing I always do--

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can see there
on your recipe sheet--

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:84%
it's all melt down half
a pound of cacao butter

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.517 align:middle line:84%
and one pound of coconut
cream concentrate.

00:35:42.517 --> 00:35:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So once we melt that
down, we're going

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate the dry
ingredients together.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have here half
a cup of carob powder,

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:84%
one cup of cacao powder,
and one cup of cacao nibs.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Raw cacao has a number of
different neurotransmitter

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.640 align:middle line:84%
chemicals that pretty much
go directly to the brain

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:90%
when you consume it.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:90%
One of which is called PEA.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.318 align:middle line:90%
It's the love bliss chemical.

00:36:07.318 --> 00:36:08.985 align:middle line:84%
So like people, you
know how they always

00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
say, like, oh, when
I eat chocolate,

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:90%
it's like I'm in love.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:11.885 --> 00:36:12.968 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exactly like that.

00:36:12.968 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:84%
People really are experiencing
the same hormonal signals

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:84%
in their brain as when they're
in love from eating chocolate.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So now we're got
our dry ingredients.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.380 align:middle line:90%
We've got our wet ingredients.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And all it takes now is
just mixing them together.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.555 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
incorporate a little at a time.

00:36:26.555 --> 00:36:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So you can just pour a
little bit of powder.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.463 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.463 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
As you're mixing
it, you can start

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:84%
to see it starts to
what I call seize.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, what that means
is when you start mixing it,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to see the bottom
of the bowl really clearly.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, we're
going to add our sweetener.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is Yacon syrup
that I'm adding here.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Yacon syrup comes
from a Yacon root.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And it has a very, very
low glycemic index,

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.115 align:middle line:84%
as low as some
standard vegetables

00:36:54.115 --> 00:36:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that you might find out in
your standard salad bar.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you guys smell
this, by the way?

00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo!

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:90%
That's intoxicating on its own.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Chocolate.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Kirk and I can't wait to just--

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Stick your finger in it.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.845 align:middle line:84%
>> We just want the
almonds on the inside.

00:37:11.845 --> 00:37:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, you can
put almond butter.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.685 align:middle line:90%
Make almond butter cups.

00:37:14.685 --> 00:37:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Or just along with them.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Peanut butter cups.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Or just cover them.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you guys ready to try this?

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.390 align:middle line:90%
We'll go around this way.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the texture with this
chocolate and the taste

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a lot
different when it's warm.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Taste like that coconut.

00:37:32.715 --> 00:37:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Taste the coconut.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Dang.

00:37:35.195 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But essentially,
that does it.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.396 align:middle line:90%
That's Chocolate Making 101.

00:37:38.396 --> 00:37:40.634 align:middle line:90%
So thank you all for coming.

00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.143 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't wait to
eat the rest of it.

00:37:43.143 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill, you should have
seen his legs this morning.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean bad.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Does your skin get real dry?

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.927 align:middle line:90%
So this is what you need.

00:38:00.927 --> 00:38:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Feel how dry those are?

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.050 align:middle line:90%
This feel like elephant skin.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:38:05.295 --> 00:38:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>> You see what I'm saying?

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That's horrible.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's terrible.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to scare you
or nothing, but my grandmother,

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.450 align:middle line:84%
they took her feet
off, both of them.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they went up to her knees.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
what we're here for.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.262 align:middle line:90%
>> And this up here killed her.

00:38:22.262 --> 00:38:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's what
we're working on.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>> After breakfast 128.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.790 align:middle line:84%
It was one-- was it
110 this morning?

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> My gosh.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> 128.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> After breakfast.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:34.920 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.550 align:middle line:90%
That is normal.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me check mine again, and
see what the hell I'm doing.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Dropped to 194.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Super.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.560 align:middle line:90%
So I'm dropping again.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:90%
No insulin.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Watch out.

00:38:52.675 --> 00:38:55.472 align:middle line:84%
If this keeps up, I'll be
feeling like a man pretty son

00:38:55.472 --> 00:38:56.305 align:middle line:90%
instead of a eunuch.

00:38:56.305 --> 00:38:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>> My blood sugar is 155.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>> From this morning it was 176.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.300 align:middle line:90%
My breathing is better.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.644 align:middle line:84%
My mind is clearer
for some reason.

00:39:09.644 --> 00:39:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> You feel clear?

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Any other time I'd be
thinking about food all

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I get those
waves of hunger.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm on a
cracker binge or feen.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm really feening for crackers.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you bring me crackers?

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Crackers?

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, crackers.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.992 align:middle line:84%
>> You want some
kind of cracker?

00:39:29.992 --> 00:39:31.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:39:31.285 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> --telling her
about the Cheese Nips.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.246 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have trans fat.

00:39:34.246 --> 00:39:35.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Just tell Michael--

00:39:35.163 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm telling you about the
Cheese Nips that they have

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:90%
at the store.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:45.140 align:middle line:84%
It has partially
hydrogenated whatever crap.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's not wholly,
it's partially.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.695 align:middle line:90%
I want a whole pack of crackers.

00:39:50.695 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'll eat maybe one a day.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.175 align:middle line:84%
I just have the Cheese
Nips in my memory.

00:40:00.175 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:84%
They have them new now
with jalapeno stuff in it.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The tendency can be to rush
to the fridge or the larder

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and binge on goodness
knows what kind of food,

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.080 align:middle line:84%
foods we might not even had
eaten for 10 or 20 years.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people's big
concern, certainly mine,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:90%
is with taste buds.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Concerned with making
your taste buds happy.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a nice
little walk, isn't it?

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me my sugar
will be going down.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, your
sugar will be down.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.753 align:middle line:90%
We need exercise.

00:40:32.753 --> 00:40:36.947 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.947 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they got a market over here.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh.

00:40:38.723 --> 00:40:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Valentine Potluck.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Brown sugar, cinnamon.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:90%
It says flavor in every bite.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.367 align:middle line:84%
>> They had Cheese Nips
and it said zero sugar.

00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, you're
good with sugar,

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:84%
but it probably got other fat
in it, like trans fats, though.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, gosh, 250 milligrams
of sodium, but no cholesterol.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.920 align:middle line:90%
No trans fat.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:90%
No saturated fat.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:90%
No sugar.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Zero sugar.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll get another two.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Cottonseed oil.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:16.245 align:middle line:84%
>> You get two,
and I'll get two.

00:41:16.245 --> 00:41:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Cornstarch.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:18.940 align:middle line:90%
You win.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Hydrogenated, partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.145 align:middle line:84%
That's the stuff that gets
you, but it's also good.

00:41:23.145 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Corn syrup--

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know what--

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --in crackers.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So you get 9% for each
one of these slices you eat?

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:41.380 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.280 align:middle line:90%
It says--

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.014 align:middle line:90%
>> One serving is one slice.

00:41:45.014 --> 00:41:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.480 align:middle line:90%
So I eat one a day.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how you have to
learn how to read labels.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you can.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a big difference.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm run-down.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:90%
My body is run-down.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.040 align:middle line:84%
My sinuses-- I didn't
sleep at all last night.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Change of diet, everything's
just boom, boom, boom.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:90%
My body's tired.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.846 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to--

00:42:13.846 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting ornery.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.272 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:23.897 align:middle line:84%
>> No, when I say
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:42:23.897 --> 00:42:25.420 align:middle line:90%

00:49:06.696 --> 00:49:09.480 align:middle line:90%

up out of this damn bed.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not doing nothing
but sapping your energy.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:23.610 align:middle line:90%

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Walk out on the porch.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Sit out there.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.430 align:middle line:90%

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So he needs to stop
staying in his room.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.693 align:middle line:84%

to stop pampering him.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Work.

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Have to.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
a lot of work.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But then nothing
good is ever easy.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.040 align:middle line:90%

>> The salad's lost.

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> The raw food is lost.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Lost.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like,
wow, what's lost

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.882 align:middle line:90%
is what's actually healing you.

00:50:15.882 --> 00:50:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.870 align:middle line:84%

raw food a shot.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, even if
it's just for a day.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.430 align:middle line:84%
This is such an
experiential journey

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.140 align:middle line:90%
that people have to try it.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.113 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:50:27.113 --> 00:50:28.030 align:middle line:90%
You can read about it.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:29.320 align:middle line:90%
You can hear about it.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.600 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the food
and feel wowed by it.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.047 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually getting
that food in your body

00:50:34.047 --> 00:50:35.130 align:middle line:90%
that's all the difference.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone that
takes that step

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and is brave enough to say,
yeah, I'll give it a week,

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I'll give it 30
days, whatever it is.

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:44.360 align:middle line:84%
The proof of the pudding
is in the eating.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And when people gave themselves
that gift, that opportunity,

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.990 align:middle line:90%
the rewards will come.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, they will come.

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.790 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:55.340 align:middle line:84%

blood sugar doing?

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.335 align:middle line:90%
>> It's high.

00:50:56.335 --> 00:50:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Low, high, whatever.

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're still taking about
25% of the insulin you were

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.720 align:middle line:90%
taking?

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're feeling
pretty good with that?

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.018 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:06.018 --> 00:51:08.310 align:middle line:84%

the potential of getting off

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.210 align:middle line:84%
insulin for the
rest of your life?

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably 0%
chance that I will.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>> You know--

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Realistically.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> --I don't buy that.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I-- like, I want to get
off insulin more than anything.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.590 align:middle line:84%
That would be the best thing in
the world to get off insulin.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But every doctor I've ever had
since I've been 10 years old

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.550 align:middle line:84%
has told me that I'll take
shots for the rest of my life.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And that there's no hope of
ever getting off insulin.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So just accept the fact that
I'm going to be taking shots

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.330 align:middle line:90%
for rest of my life.

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.730 align:middle line:84%

00:51:42.537 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:84%

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:84%

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to kind of read

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I just figured I will go.

But when I need to,
I have, you know?

00:57:20.266 --> 00:57:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't even
care about eating.

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
drink just because they

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:28.060 align:middle line:84%
don't want-- they really
didn't want me to, you know?

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, I mean, I wouldn't
have anyway on the diet.

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:34.180 align:middle line:84%

really were adamant about it.

a beer or nothing.

Look at that.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Five hours of the day.

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Got to go to Mexico.

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Great time.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Genuine Mexican tequila
bought from Mexico.

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:12.490 align:middle line:90%

>> What about the booze?

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.610 align:middle line:84%

booze in Mexico.

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:20.280 align:middle line:84%

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Go buy a breathalyzer.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:29.560 align:middle line:90%
No, I haven't been drinking.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Why even ask me?

00:58:45.093 --> 00:58:46.510 align:middle line:84%

>> OK, no, that's perfec--

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not too low?

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.863 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's not low.

00:58:50.863 --> 00:58:51.930 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>> But he went to bed late.

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was sleeping
on the couch.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:57.570 align:middle line:90%

00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I was on the phone.

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like
going back in the room.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> So 84--

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:05.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Plus Austin was throwing up
all night, and I was like, OK.

00:59:05.242 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Why was Austin
throwing up all night?

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess he was trying to
recover from his alcohol.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't get all of that.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> He hitchhiked to Mexico.

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.472 align:middle line:90%
>> So he's recuperating then.

00:59:15.472 --> 00:59:17.877 align:middle line:84%
Make sure he drinks
plenty of fluids.

00:59:17.877 --> 00:59:24.630 align:middle line:90%


00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>> 206.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Not bad at all.

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.405 align:middle line:84%
For what people and
I would have thought.

00:59:32.405 --> 00:59:34.655 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad at all.

00:59:34.655 --> 00:59:38.120 align:middle line:90%


00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.450 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing, Keith?

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:42.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Was wondering what this is.

00:59:42.402 --> 00:59:43.260 align:middle line:90%
And that.

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's mine.

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll keep them.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've been
drinking alcohol.

00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I drank some yesterday.

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I didn't drink none today.

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.680 align:middle line:90%
I just woke up though.

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Here's the thing.

00:59:56.790 --> 01:00:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Taking alcohol is
something that clearly you

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.840 align:middle line:84%
agreed not to do to
be in this program.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.920 align:middle line:90%


01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So I just drank a
little bit yesterday.

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the only day?

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, I won't sit there
and drink all the time.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm barely ever drinking.

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've been staying
on this diet really good.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.623 align:middle line:84%
I haven't eaten anything
since I've been here.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I haven't eaten one thing.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Besides this food.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I haven't drank any soda.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I haven't drank any juice.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.027 align:middle line:90%
Haven't drank any sugar.

01:00:37.027 --> 01:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really more concerned,
not with the fact that you

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
drank alcohol, not with the
fact that you have tobacco.

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, what will
allow Austin to heal?

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
You're this handsome,
charismatic young guy,

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and you have these
patterns in your behavior

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
where you're putting
on a show for people.

01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I bet you've heard this
from your dad, your mom,

01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:58.620 align:middle line:90%
your brothers, your friends.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Am I the first guy
to ever say this?

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to do this
diet as much as I could.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I see it.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I have seen--

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I just went to Mexico
yesterday and just got a--

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
not even drank that
much, like, seriously.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Man, this is--

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.068 align:middle line:84%
>> I would have drank
a fifth, like, in--

01:01:18.068 --> 01:01:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Just 30 days.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> This is just 30 days.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but--

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.960 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Because Dr. Cousins now,
he can't have a baseline

01:01:27.157 --> 01:01:28.740 align:middle line:84%
of saying, hey, this
will help Austin.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.657 align:middle line:84%
In three months, he's
going to be off insulin.

01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:32.865 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever believe that
could actually happen?

01:01:32.865 --> 01:01:34.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope.

01:01:34.923 --> 01:01:35.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:35.905 --> 01:01:46.220 align:middle line:90%

this diet can affect a type 1

diabetic.

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:53.435 align:middle line:90%
And it's really been great.

01:08:53.435 --> 01:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm on, like, not
much insulin at all.

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:56.660 align:middle line:90%
I feel great.

01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just happier than I
usually am on my old diet.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.599 align:middle line:84%
>> How much less insulin are
you taking, percentage wise?

01:09:03.599 --> 01:09:04.399 align:middle line:90%
Tell them.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.630 align:middle line:90%

[LAUGHTER]

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
--about a sixth, one sixth of
the insulin that I was taking.

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yahoo!

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Yahoo, that's incredible.

01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:15.887 align:middle line:90%
The food's good, you know.

01:09:15.887 --> 01:09:16.970 align:middle line:90%
The food's getting better.

01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of nice people

of a raw diet or vegan diet,

01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:24.359 align:middle line:84%
you expect someone
to be, you know,

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.439 align:middle line:84%
a lot skinnier or
emaciated looking.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> You can say it, "scrawny."

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, but--
that's not the case.

01:09:30.696 --> 01:09:32.279 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I'm
experiencing here.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I've gained
about 2 pounds of muscle

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:35.660 align:middle line:90%
off of this diet.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a nice lean--

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:38.960 align:middle line:90%
more integrity.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.109 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot safer, you know,
than eating the protein

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:43.505 align:middle line:90%
from your chicken and so forth.

01:09:43.505 --> 01:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Not as bad on the arteries.

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So you actually can be
really, really healthy

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:49.810 align:middle line:84%
off of vegetables,
off of raw vegetables.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:51.712 align:middle line:90%
So it's extremely good.

01:09:51.712 --> 01:09:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I'm definitely

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%

worry about chewing or--

now that it's different.

and drinking.

Which I had no idea before.

I don't even deserve to
be here, and I never have.

guys have given me.

It's been great.

And I thank you guys for
everything you've taught me.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
For taking me down to 5 units of
insulin, which I never thought

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:34.050 align:middle line:90%
would happen in my entire life.

willing to make that one little

decision to go from here to

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Then it allows the
healing to happen.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's all within us to
allow that to happen.

All you have to do is change
your heart, change your ways.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%

Gabriel read the blood

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And all my readings were normal.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
This, as far as I'm concerned,

Who could ever have thought
about all this stuff

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
happening in a month,
just eating God's food?

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, natural enzymatic
food, the natural enzymes.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
God, I've missed
so much of my life.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:48.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I hope to
impress on my children

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
the right way to do this,
living here, you know,

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.390 align:middle line:90%
and be healthy and be clear.

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to see my
son get married.

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.710 align:middle line:90%
I want to see him have children.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.677 align:middle line:90%
I want to know his children.

01:14:59.677 --> 01:15:01.010 align:middle line:90%
I want to be around for a while.

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:04.340 align:middle line:84%
My daughter-- and I want
to see her son grow up.

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Those are all the
wonderful things,

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:07.005 align:middle line:90%
the real things in life.

01:15:07.005 --> 01:15:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to miss it.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:17.462 align:middle line:84%
So God gave me another chance
here to live my life over

01:15:17.462 --> 01:15:18.262 align:middle line:90%
again.

01:15:18.262 --> 01:15:22.182 align:middle line:90%


01:15:22.182 --> 01:15:22.982 align:middle line:90%

Love you, Bil!

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have to do this
for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days,

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
for your life to
be able to improve.

01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
You just need to take
it a step at a time.

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
As they say, baby steps.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Take a little baby step, and
you'll start feeling better.

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.838 align:middle line:84%
And you'll do more, and you'll
do more, and you'll do more.

01:15:37.838 --> 01:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning, just
eliminate all things white from

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.500 align:middle line:90%
your diet.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Eliminate the sugar.

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Eliminate the white flour.

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
If you can't
eliminate it totally,

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:53.397 align:middle line:84%
cut back tremendously on
the dead meat products.

01:15:53.397 --> 01:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Begin to eliminate
that kind of thing.

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And begin to add living food.

01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.757 align:middle line:84%
and allow the nutrients to be
assimilated and incorporated

01:23:13.757 --> 01:23:14.570 align:middle line:90%
into our body.

01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:16.690 align:middle line:90%
And in all things, God.

01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Amen.

01:23:19.822 --> 01:23:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, let's try this.

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.830 align:middle line:90%
See how it tastes.

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:24.255 align:middle line:90%


01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It kind of
feels like lasagna.

01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It tastes like a noodle.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, it does.

01:23:30.692 --> 01:23:32.520 align:middle line:90%
It looks good.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That salad's real good.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the conditions we're
having now are because we moved

01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:40.290 align:middle line:90%
to this fast-food nation.

01:23:40.290 --> 01:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Before we would take
time to make food.

01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Now we don't do that.

01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Raw food requires that again.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to take the time to
put your energy, your love,

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.583 align:middle line:84%
into making food, and then
sharing it with others.

01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:51.750 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you one thing.

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole lot
less time involved

01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
by making food than having to
spend four days in a hospital.

01:23:58.230 --> 01:24:02.420 align:middle line:90%


01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So I've officially been back
to Baltimore for a little

01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:06.980 align:middle line:90%
over 60 days.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I got blood work
drawn on Tuesday.

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get
the results back.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:39.080 align:middle line:90%


01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.240 align:middle line:90%
The results were amazing.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Based off the lab results
I had before, I was type 1.

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not supposed to
be producing insulin.

01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:47.730 align:middle line:90%
This isn't supposed to happen.

01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see from the
results, I'm producing insulin.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I can go from being type
1, to not having diabetes.

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:54.380 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Diabetes is reversible.

01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:59.840 align:middle line:90%
We have the results to show it.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.160 align:middle line:90%


01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What we see in this one-month
experience is everybody went

01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:10.370 align:middle line:90%
off all their medications.

01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Cholesterol all went to normal.

01:25:12.370 --> 01:25:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Mind sharp, clear, happy.

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:18.575 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing
is they have walked

01:25:18.575 --> 01:25:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the mountain
of their human potential.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Their minds have come back.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Their bodies have come back.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Their joy has come back.

01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:28.550 align:middle line:90%
You now know you have a choice.

01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:29.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty.

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes is not
a death sentence.

01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Your chronic disease is
not a death sentence.

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You can choose life
and turn this around

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
in a matter of weeks.

01:25:37.490 --> 01:27:10.190 align:middle line:90%
