meet Glenda the Good.

You know, the witch who pranced
through enchanted poppy fields

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%
in the north of Oz?

Her real name was Val Gente.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And she was raised on
the island of Haiti,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
not with a litter of
prune-faced munchkins.

Val used the ancient skills

with the tools of the
DJ in the digital age.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
She was a sorcerer
of shamanic talent

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
with a gift for speaking to
both the living and the dead.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:10%
I was impressed,
but I also realized

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:10%
this was just the first
of my long journey.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%

I have experienced that in
certain other circumstances.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:10%
But I've only noticed
energy like this, like,

It's very electric.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Very calming.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's a whole
thing about art, spirituality,

>> If you put your hands close
to a speaker while there's some

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
heavy bass, you're going to
feel something in your hands.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:90%
That's frequency.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the physical
manifestation of frequency.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's some energy
coming out of there

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
that you can't see, but you feel
it in your hands sort of thing.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So frequencies, coming from the
Haitian culture, the Haitian

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Voodoo culture, we're dealing
with so specific rhythm

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:90%
patterns, specific chants.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:84%

And certain songs you don't
sing after 3:00 PM on Thursdays,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:90%
you just don't.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knows
not to sing it,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
frequency in that song

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want to manifest.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much, the sound
manifests in physical reality.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So the sound that
I'm creating in here

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.305 align:middle line:90%
is also what you're feeling.

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you walk into
the church or the temple,

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
because the frequency
is still there,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a remnant of
it that's in the space.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And it stays there.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:90%
You can't really get rid of it.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.615 align:middle line:84%

in Hamden, Connecticut.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%

I've lived in Los Angeles,

After 10 amazing years
in that city of ravens,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:10%
a place I felt was
my natural home,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:10%
Hamden, was the last
place I ever imagined.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:10%

If you're familiar
with me at all,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:10%
it's because I published
two books, "Negrophobia"

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:10%
and "That's Blacksploitation,
Roots of the Badass 'Tude"

house in January of 2007.

My time in Berlin had
come to an abrupt end.

My father had died.

He was 81 years old.

All that remained of my
father was his mask collection

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%

It was an unusual look at
Haitian spiritual traditions

through the lens of
contemporary art.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:84%
That's where I met its young
curator, Chanterelle Lewis.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Chanterelle reminds me
of a young Mohammad Ali.

She has the distinct lines
and grace of a dancer

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:90%
and the mind of a boxer.

I wanted to know more about her.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I had a feeling she was more
than professionally involved

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
with the themes
of her exhibition.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So a few weeks later, I dropped
by at her home in Brooklyn.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.226 align:middle line:90%

you move about the

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:90%
So your ancestors walk with you.

They're not just off somewhere
in this random kingdom.

But they protect you
every single day.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:90%
And so you'll see basic altars.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:90%
You might see glasses of water.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, each glass
representing a different group

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:90%
of ancestors.

acknowledge your ancestors?

>> Well, this is like
a daily practice.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I try to acknowledge
them on a daily basis.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But I generally try to refresh
my altar with the glasses

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.559 align:middle line:90%
of water on Sundays.

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it has something to
do with my Catholic upbringing,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:90%
the Christian upbringing.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But that's a day where
I'm starting my week off.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:84%

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:10%
But when I've tried to
talk with him about it

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:10%
in the past in terms of
spiritual powers of Africa,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:10%
he was kind of blind to that.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.780 align:middle line:10%
He was looking at it purely--

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.275 align:middle line:10%
>> From aesthetic reasons?

00:13:03.275 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what he
was telling me.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:10%
You know what I'm saying?

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Which kind of led
to this project

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
that there are these African
influences in people's lives

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
want to acknowledge.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, based on
what I know about yoy,

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.091 align:middle line:84%
you recognize those powers,
and you respect them.

00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:34.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:13:34.645 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
People have been
taught, and especially

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
generations prior
to ours have been

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
taught that anything
associated with Africa

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
was bad unless it was
an aesthetic thing.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
You can relate to the
aesthetic of a mask,

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.424 align:middle line:84%
or you can relate to
the aesthetic of fabric

00:13:50.424 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:90%
or this, that, or the other.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
But the actual culture,
the actual people, that

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:90%
was eschewed.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
You can go to any museum and
you can see African masks.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
But they don't concentrate.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:84%
They call it art, and
it's not really art.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
These are ritual
items and objects

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that people use
for points of power

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and for points of
spiritual reference.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:90%
They don't talk about that.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's eschewed.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's non-Christian
in this society that is looked

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:90%
at--

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But yet, you can look at the
same object as a European

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, this
is a great mask.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Let me put some wax on it
and shine it up and put it

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:90%
next to a Picasso or something.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you start
talking about it

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
in its natural setting
as a religious object,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:90%
people get upset.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we were taught.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> You're 100% right.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.770 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid, because
they really don't know.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But if we look a
little deeper, we'll

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:90%
see what the truth is in there.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:84%
People have walked in here
and looked at the stuff

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and turned around
and walked out.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.090 align:middle line:84%
People who talk a lot of black
stuff say, oh, no, no, no, man.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.896 align:middle line:84%
I can't be in the
room with that stuff.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the absence of faith--

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --to begin with, you know?

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And the more we look
at what we have here,

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
the more we look and get to
understand and let some of it

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
be revealed to you,
then you'll really

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.836 align:middle line:90%
see how fortunate you are.

00:15:12.836 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And you'll see
where you power lies.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Your power lies
in your history.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.174 align:middle line:84%
For me, I started
collecting African art--

00:15:20.174 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
well, my father
taught black history.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't necessarily
teach African history,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:90%
but African-American history.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But when I started painting
years and years and years ago,

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and I started looking
at the European masters,

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
immediately I was attracted to
Picasso and his cubist stuff,

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
not knowing at the time
that he had been referencing

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
African art or African objects
to create these paintings

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and to create this stuff.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a self-taught artist.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked deeper,
I started looking to,

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:90%
where did he get this from.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.936 align:middle line:84%
And where did all these
Europeans who are considered

00:15:54.936 --> 00:15:56.950 align:middle line:90%
masters getting this stuff from?

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I moved beyond
that and started

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:84%
looking at things
that were closer,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
like this painting by Wilfredo
Lamb, an Afro-Cuban painter.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And the way painted it, it
has deeper spiritual meaning

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:90%
than what Picasso put out there.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Picasso put figures out there.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Wilfredo Lamb tapped into the
spirits and Santeria and all

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:84%
those things that I had a
natural affinity for that

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:84%
beyond the surface to the actual
spiritual of what and object

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You mentioned the Cubans.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:84%
The Cubans, they were
able to maintain a lot

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:90%
of their African heritage.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:90%
My godfather in my religion--

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
I am a Palo Mayombe.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Cuba.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And what he was
came from Africa.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:10%
I felt, when I walked
into this house--

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:10%
I was, oh, man, I'm
amongst my people.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.716 align:middle line:10%
>> That's how I feel.

00:16:49.716 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:10%
>> That's how I feel.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm amongst my people.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.284 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad we're
now, some of us,

00:16:56.284 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:90%
are looking a little deeper.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.945 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Together with
my friend Kaneen,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I went to join our ancestors
occupying Wall Street.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
They weren't pounding drums
in Zuccotti park, though.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
They took their
movement underground,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
camping out in silent
protest underneath lower

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Broadway since the 1690s.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Kaneen is a dedicated New
York City public school

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:84%
teacher, actress, and Zora
Neale Hurston scholar.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Talking to her is like
staring into the high beams

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:90%
of a speeding oncoming car.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> --where dreams are made of.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know much of
the African burial ground?

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Ironically, I do
and I don't and I do.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was like
breaking news,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
because they were busy
building some building.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
That was the goal, some
financial building,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
whatever building they
were trying to build.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And they just had to
go dig up the ground.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And in that process of
building the foundation,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
this became breaking news,
like, oh, we can't just build

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:90%
a foundation on these graves.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it really
started to come out.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:90%
This is '95, I think, or '96.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:90%
I think it was '95.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was '95.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.120 align:middle line:90%
So I was in fifth grade, yeah.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:10%
And they were like, whoa,
shoot, we can't just

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:10%
build on this land.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion of the
fact that these are slaves,

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
this isn't just
any random grave.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But these are the slaves that
actually Built New York City.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
They literally built this city.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were buried
underneath rock and granite.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion of you
can't you can't erase it--

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny,
because even now,

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:90%
me as a social studies teacher--

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I taught fifth grade social
studies two years ago.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had to prepare them
for fifth grade state test.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's all this stuff
about New York history.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:90%
They need to know.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
At fifth grade they should know
the difference between rural,

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
suburban, and urban.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
They need to know about the
Niagara Falls and the new trade

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
routes that were developed
and beaver pelts.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:90%
They need to know these things.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.514 align:middle line:84%
And I usually feel like I don't
like teaching American history,

00:19:11.514 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:90%
because it's all wars.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It's all the
glorification of war,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:90%
War of 1812, French and Indian.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.995 align:middle line:90%
It's just war, war, war.

00:19:19.995 --> 00:19:21.495 align:middle line:84%
And it never talks
about the people.

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It never talks
about the real story

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:84%
is about people and the
rebellion and the revolution.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And so they gave me this book.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.191 align:middle line:84%
And it was like this thick,
just to prep them for the test.

00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:90%
The test is in November.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:90%
School starts in September.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.825 align:middle line:84%
And they had maybe two
paragraphs on slavery

00:19:38.825 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:90%
in this entire book.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
There's stuff on
the Constitution

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:90%
they have to learn.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:84%
There's stuff on the Supreme
Court, the judicial branch,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
legislative branch,
branches of government,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff, the Industrial
Revolution, all this stuff

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.040 align:middle line:84%
that these little fifth
graders need to know.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, which is interesting
because knowing about slavery

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:84%
would put everything
else into perspective.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It would, because the whole
capitalistic structure of New

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:90%
York City and all of America--

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
New York City was the hub
of capitalism at that time

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:90%
and still is.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Was all based on all
of the slave labor--

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:84%
like the whole notion
of Wall Street--

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Bank of New York, they
all either insured

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.559 align:middle line:90%
slaves, invested in slaves--

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
the East India Company,
West India company,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:84%
all these companies
that we do or do not

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
know, we do or do not
recognize, a lot of them--

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Lehman Brothers-- all these
companies that are on Wall

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:33.597 align:middle line:90%
Street today--

00:20:33.597 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
not all of them,
obviously-- but there

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
are some of them that really
do still have a legacy

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.185 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't be the
companies that they

00:20:39.185 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
were if they weren't
investing in slave labor way

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:90%
back to today.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The burial ground is at the
heart of American capitalism.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Which was an
interesting thing,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:84%
because as I was going
through the rotunda here,

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:90%
they had a symbol from Legba.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the crossroads.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the crossroads, which
told me that the crossroads

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:84%
wasn't about deciding what
direction you were going

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to take, what fated decision
we're going to make.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But rather, it was
about contradiction,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
which is probably
the reason why Legba

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:90%
is considered a trickster.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And I love Legba.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean Legba is Bugs Bunny.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
That whole notion
of what is reality,

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and I can shift it
based on perception

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and what you are
beholden to as reality--

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and that's existentialism.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
That could become
nihilism or denial.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Because what is reality?

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
New York would not be New York
without the backs of slaves.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Just like in the book by Zora
Neale Hurston about Moses,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
the whole story starts
off with the fact

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:90%
that these slaves in Egypt--

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that all this labor
is on our back.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.506 align:middle line:84%
And we can't do
anything about it.

00:22:04.506 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:90%
We learn nothing but sorrow.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:84%
If nothing else, that's
the lasting legacy

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that this leader,
this pharaoh wants

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:90%
to sit there and impart to us.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you mean nothing
other than your labor.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And so great, you see
these beautiful temples.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Great, you see these
beautiful pyramids, great.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:84%
But that lasting legacy of the
blood, the sweat, and the tears

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is still in everything
that we see.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.939 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, that's the
path that we must choose.

00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:10%
You know what I'm saying?

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And the path that a lot
of history books shows

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:84%
is in one direction,
which is eh, erase

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:90%
that, eh, it doesn't matter.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, nihilism,
denial of the truth.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally sitting
there, looking at this book,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
under the pressure of preparing
fifth graders, who 70% of them

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.997 align:middle line:84%
could not read on a fifth grade
level-- this is in 2008, OK?

00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't read
on a fifth grade level,

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:90%
you really can't read.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have two months
to prepare these kids.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at the history
again, looking at the history

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.226 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really thinking
to myself, wait a minute.

00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Did slavery not happen?

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to go back and find
other books and other resources

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and teach that whole
portion of history.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting,
because you talked about--

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of Manhattan's
financial district

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.430 align:middle line:90%
is a sacred space.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
It seems to exist as if
some mysterious circumstance

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of history has joined forces
with all the world's religions,

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
including Voodoo to confront
the very powers of Mammon

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:90%
that Wall Street represents.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And I find even
here, we all must

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.500 align:middle line:84%
ask Legba for his permission
to pass through the gates.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:90%
--and lines.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it's beautiful,
the way that they designed this

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
entire burial ground in terms
of, it does actually reference

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the Sankofa symbols.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:10%
But this is a monument
to give these people

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:10%
some form of a voice.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>The thing that
I'm thinking about,

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:90%
past and present coexist.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they're parallel.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And then as some times,
when you ask questions,

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:90%
they can become perpendicular.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power
of asking questions.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Why, how, where, who--

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and then they also
notice it's raining.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.237 align:middle line:90%
I'm noticing that.

00:24:28.237 --> 00:24:29.403 align:middle line:90%
>> I kind of like the image.

00:24:29.403 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm?

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.083 align:middle line:90%
>> I like the image.

00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:84%
My father never
really understood

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:90%
why I preferred living abroad.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I once wrote him a letter
and explained the reasons

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
why I vowed I would never live
again in the United States.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
His only reply was that
he didn't understand.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:90%
For me, why was simple.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.246 align:middle line:84%
This place had nothing
for me, or at least

00:25:06.246 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that's what I
thought until I was

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.930 align:middle line:90%
struck by a cold realization.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:84%
There was something,
maybe something unique.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I
started this journey

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
was to find out what
that something is.

Pastor MacArthur
McKinley, Baptist town's

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:10%
gold-toothed and Jheri-curled
reverend in a Stacy Adams suit.

asked, where can I

get me a suit like that.

Are you a married

No, why?

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's good, because
if you were married

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and you wore a suit like
mine, it would only lead you

now, we in Baptist town.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Baptist town
is like a safe haven

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:84%
for a blues singer like
Robert Johnson, Honeyboy

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Edward, Guitar Slim.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.910 align:middle line:84%
All those guys would
live in this area.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.837 align:middle line:84%
They would live in this
area so they wouldn't

00:28:49.837 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:84%
go to the cotton
field and go to work,

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:84%
because they lived
up across the river

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.269 align:middle line:84%
with the boss man would
make sure they'd be at work.

00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But they lived over here so they
could hide out in the houses

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.117 align:middle line:90%
and wouldn't go to work.

00:29:00.117 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what guys like Robert
Johnson and Honeyboy Edwards,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:84%
those guys would
do, because they

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
could make more money
playing music on the corner

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.608 align:middle line:84%
than they could
picking up cotton.

00:29:09.608 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Johnson would have
been 100 years old today.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.182 align:middle line:84%
But I really honestly
didn't understand who

00:29:50.182 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:90%

If what Mr. Hoover
said was true,

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.060 align:middle line:84%
how was it that a man
played the blues was being

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.240 align:middle line:90%
celebrated in a cotton museum?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I'd go
talk with Steve Levier.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Steve is a big presence in
Greenwood's blues community.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And he plays an even bigger
part keeping the legacy

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:90%
of Robert Johnson alive.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Greenwood is the world's
first long staple cotton

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And it moved to
Memphis about 1900.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So things don't move too quickly
in the delta, as you know.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Things have a tendency to
maintain and retain and be

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:90%
retained.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
that's all about.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But as far as who owns
Robert Johnson is concerned,

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.640 align:middle line:84%
which I think was one
of the early posits

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that you set forth in your
question, Robert Johnson

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and what is considered
country blues

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and, really, I think
that's just a small portion

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:84%
of all indigenous
American music, jazz,

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.180 align:middle line:84%
American black
gospel, white gospel,

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.340 align:middle line:84%
it has its roots in
two primary cultures

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that the world has produced,
the European culture

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.810 align:middle line:90%
and the African culture.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And they came together
on this continent.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
aspect to the story.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But from what I
understand, there's

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
this whole generation
of British musicians

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
who had discovered blues,
American blues, which

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
was discarded, I
think, by and large.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But they had picked
it up and created

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
this whole sensation in rock
music in the '60s and '70s.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When the British musicians
who were looking for songs

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.315 align:middle line:84%
to play rather than
write their own--

00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:30.940 align:middle line:84%
why write your own when there's
a guy like Robert Johnson who's

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.606 align:middle line:84%
written the great
song that we could do.

00:32:32.606 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's do "Dust My Broom."

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's do "Sweet Home Chicago."

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's do "Come on
in My Kitchen."

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they got their
energy behind that

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.530 align:middle line:90%
and sold it back to America.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I can see that, actually.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:90%
I heard a tape.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.120 align:middle line:84%
It was an acoustic tape
that Keith Richards had done

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.370 align:middle line:90%
covering Robert Johnson songs.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:59.230 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I began to have
respect for Keith Richards,

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.263 align:middle line:10%
knowing that he was a
serious student of the music.

00:33:02.263 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he said so on
numbers of occasions, yeah.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:34.190 align:middle line:90%

It's right out here.

00:33:40.812 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
You see, most of the people
do not have stones like this.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them, early 1900s.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And you will see some
of them is hand made.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them just
was made with just wood,

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.069 align:middle line:84%
you know just a cross
made out of wood.

00:33:56.069 --> 00:33:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And they just stuck
it in the ground.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Johnson, he
died right across the field

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.950 align:middle line:84%
over here, because he followed
a girl home that night.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.020 align:middle line:84%
He followed Turtletaub's
daughter home that night.

cotton all the way down

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.710 align:middle line:84%
to where you see
them trees, you would

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.565 align:middle line:90%
hear music coming from here.

00:34:20.565 --> 00:34:22.315 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would say,
you hear that singing,

00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:23.231 align:middle line:90%
you hear that singing.

00:34:23.231 --> 00:34:26.624 align:middle line:84%

>> Legend has it Robert Johnson
went down to the crossroads

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
and gave the devil his guitar
and a fried chicken sandwich.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
The devil turned the guitar
and ate the sandwich, saying,

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
but your soul would taste a
hell of a lot better, yum, yum.

shrugged his shoulders

and handed over his soul.

That's sort of a
Christian perspective.

But in African-American
culture, we

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.200 align:middle line:84%
don't all buy into
that, because we

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.350 align:middle line:84%
know that there's a larger
culture related to that,

such as understanding the
African perspective of that

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:84%

to African-American culture

as well.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:84%

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.770 align:middle line:10%
First of all, when
I hear disasters

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:46.330 align:middle line:10%
of monstrous proportions
and then I think,

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:10%
these are at least
natural, these

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:52.540 align:middle line:10%
are Mother Earth rising up.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about the
proportion of the disaster that

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:84%
was slavery and that was
the supposed founding

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.090 align:middle line:84%
of this country and
the discovery, again,

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:84%
of the New World,
I think at least

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:84%
there is something aligned and
that Haiti, like New Orleans,

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:84%
has somehow become
the conscience keeper

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.980 align:middle line:84%
for the Western world and
the violence that was done

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.190 align:middle line:90%
upon humanity at those times.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way
that people will

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:43.030 align:middle line:84%
say to me that
possession trance is

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.010 align:middle line:90%
this terrifying demonic thing--

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and I think instead that
it's exactly the opposite.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Our ego identities having
such control and such a lock

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.780 align:middle line:90%
hold on us is really scary.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And possession
trance, where you get

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:07.570 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond those boundaries
and become spirit for a while--

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:90%
So I see things always at askew.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.200 align:middle line:84%

from the time I was first born.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:90%

very much that way.

Haiti, everything's
backwards and upside down.

When I was initiating
myself in Haiti,

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.920 align:middle line:10%
all through the
initiation, which

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:35.260 align:middle line:10%
went on for a week, ahoungans,
priests, and, mambos,

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.970 align:middle line:10%
priestesses would come into
the chamber that I was in.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And they would all
say, don't think

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
this is going to make your
life any easier, it's not.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it's got
to make it harder,

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.090 align:middle line:84%
because you're basically upside
down and backwards compared

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:50.920 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:90%
And so what?

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:56.910 align:middle line:84%
You have entree
into the invisible.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It's got to make it hard for
you in the physical, mundane,

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.230 align:middle line:90%
material world.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Don't think it's going to
make anything easier for you.

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But what it does do is
tells you at what level

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and to what degree
you can engage

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in your own life and
your own experience.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And how we respond to
spirit is whether we're

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.760 align:middle line:90%
going to survive this or not.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that Haiti
or New Orleans is unique.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're being
punished by anybody.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Voodoo is not about
judging good and bad.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So that whole premise that
this is some great evil

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that God is going to punish
doesn't make any sense

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:90%

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:84%

and consciously creating

01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:36.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, here's the
story, as it come to me.

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:40.600 align:middle line:10%
When they moved the slaves here,
when they moved the Africans,

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.230 align:middle line:10%
their gods became like them.

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Powerful gods like
Legba would suddenly

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
be a cripple, a
drunkard, living in rags.

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that
when they came here,

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
two peoples had very
similar understanding

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, the
relationship with the planet,

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
the relationship with
trees, everything.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were both being
oppressed by the same guy.

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:middle line:90%
So they came together.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And they did this in the
hills and mountains of Haiti.

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:18.056 align:middle line:84%
The natives there that
Columbus hadn't killed

01:08:18.056 --> 01:08:19.930 align:middle line:90%
had run off to the mountains.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the Africans,
to do their religion,

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:25.839 align:middle line:84%
because you know it
was devil worship

01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:27.880 align:middle line:84%
according to the Catholics
that were around them,

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.979 align:middle line:84%
they had to go off
into the woods.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And when they was
in the woods, they

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.029 align:middle line:90%
run into the Native Americans.

01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And they got together.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.700 align:middle line:90%
They began to powwow.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Powwow really meant
healing ceremony.

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:42.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what powwow means.

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And they came together.

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And from this merging, all
the petra, the fire ceremonies

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and Voodoo in New
Orleans, Haitian Voodoo

01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:58.029 align:middle line:84%
came about through this blend,
which is where the Mardi Gras

01:08:58.029 --> 01:09:00.439 align:middle line:90%
Indian tradition comes from.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very telling
that the Mardi Gras Indians use

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.149 align:middle line:84%
the Indian, because they had
to have somebody who was going

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:12.049 align:middle line:90%
to fight the gods of Europe.

01:09:12.049 --> 01:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
talking to the Indians.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.965 align:middle line:84%
And the Indians fell in
love with the black people.

01:09:15.965 --> 01:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you are pretty, a
totally different view.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
White folks, well, they're ugly,
stupid, they look like monkey.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.029 align:middle line:84%
And to the Indians,
it's like, oh,

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:30.430 align:middle line:90%
beautiful, fearless, powerful.

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
There was no problem falling
in love, none at all.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that they had to
consider-- because the Indians

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.370 align:middle line:90%
had no slavery.

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:42.399 align:middle line:84%
If your a slave married
an Indian woman,

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that Indian woman was not your
slave, nor were their children.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't live
on your plantation.

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And they would help the husband.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
But they would have
their own garden.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And they would eventually
buy their husband's freedom.

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
get the whole thing

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.890 align:middle line:90%
of free people of color.

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:04.840 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the big
New Orleans things.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.547 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the few
places in the South

01:10:07.547 --> 01:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
where there were
free people of color.

01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It was the only
place in the South

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:13.570 align:middle line:84%
where the Africans
were allowed to drum,

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
because they were afraid
of the African drum,

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.844 align:middle line:84%
because it was too much like
the Native American drum.

01:10:17.844 --> 01:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And oh, are they
talking to the Indians?

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:21.799 align:middle line:90%
What are they saying?

01:10:21.799 --> 01:10:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And they would freak out.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.804 align:middle line:90%

>> I'm in my Easter Sunday best.

01:10:43.066 --> 01:10:50.570 align:middle line:90%


01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my brother.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.770 align:middle line:90%
How are things going?

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.300 align:middle line:90%

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.720 align:middle line:90%

>> "Treme?"

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> "Treme," yeah.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.500 align:middle line:90%

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
My episode was on last Thursday.

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:22.850 align:middle line:84%

first "Treme" episode I shot.

01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:25.120 align:middle line:90%

>> Yeah.

You heard that, right?

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:29.530 align:middle line:90%
I gave you a copy of that.

>> John the revelator,
Nostradamus and me,

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%

All I can think about is
air conditioning and the end

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Civil War and
how the newly freed

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:18.680 align:middle line:90%
needed to celebrate.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%

discarded in the streets by the

bands.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.100 align:middle line:84%
A new music evolved out of
the ashes of slavery and war.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
This new music was
called a lot of things,

01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:35.750 align:middle line:84%
but eventually it
was called jazz.

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Jazz is played for all
occasions in New Orleans,

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:40.804 align:middle line:84%
including funerals,
especially funerals.

see everybody out here,

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
because I always knew my
father was an icon right here

hey, with our father legacy,

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.334 align:middle line:84%
we glad to share
it with everybody

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%

are familiar with.

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But you need a first
line to have a funeral.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%

you have the deceased,

the grand marshal, the band,
and some very close members

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:26.089 align:middle line:84%

or whatever if you're cremated,

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:42.570 align:middle line:10%
is placed inside the vault,
it is the responsibility

01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:47.730 align:middle line:10%
and the honor of this spouse,
partner, child, husband,

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.890 align:middle line:10%
whoever's the closest
to the deceased

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:54.100 align:middle line:10%
to take their index finger and
make a gesture just like this.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.920 align:middle line:10%
And when they do
that, they have cut

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.980 align:middle line:10%
through an imaginary
tether which

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:02.160 align:middle line:10%
has bound that soul to earth.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.050 align:middle line:10%
When that occurs,
generally those people

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:06.360 align:middle line:10%
fall out, because
it's so intense.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.180 align:middle line:10%

is made, that's

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:12.630 align:middle line:10%

baton-twirling,

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:15.630 align:middle line:10%

an arts collective Mr.
Reed had been involved

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.085 align:middle line:10%
with in the very early '60s.

01:17:16.085 --> 01:17:20.240 align:middle line:90%


01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.110 align:middle line:84%
During Mr. Reed's frequent
visits to New York,

01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I was able to establish a
growing friendship with him.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.970 align:middle line:90%


01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:31.040 align:middle line:84%
What I love most
about Mr. Reed is

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
absolutely grotesque yet
incisive sense of humor.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
For example, we were
discussing Basquiat's fate

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.080 align:middle line:90%
at the hands of Andy Warhol.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It was like Renfield's encounter
with count Dracula, he said.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.838 align:middle line:84%
In the end, Warhol
had him eating flies.

01:17:46.838 --> 01:18:01.730 align:middle line:90%


01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
We've been on the road
for quite a few weeks.

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:06.870 align:middle line:90%
We've absorbed a lot.

01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realize I'm
just scratching

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:14.330 align:middle line:90%
the surface of my subject.

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's the essential
element is that it's a process

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:24.090 align:middle line:84%
that can absorb,
unlike prosynism,

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
where you're either with
them or you're not with them.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I think if
you just wanted

01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:32.215 align:middle line:84%
a summary, an abstract
of African religion,

01:18:32.215 --> 01:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
you could say that
something it's

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that's always able to
incorporate new ideas,

01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
incorporate religions
that are hostile to it,

01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:45.710 align:middle line:90%
like Christianity.

01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I went to a funeral at
the Church of God in Christ.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a 19th
century church, began.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And they keep the
African tradition going.

01:18:56.290 --> 01:18:57.560 align:middle line:90%
They got the drums.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.910 align:middle line:90%
They got the whole thing.

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
The middle class
people, the strivers,

01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:06.940 align:middle line:84%
bourgeois African-Americans
look down upon that.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:11.810 align:middle line:84%
In the situation that we're
in in this hemisphere,

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:16.660 align:middle line:84%
our religion has always had to
be one step ahead of the law.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Our culture has always had to
be one step ahead of the law.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.820 align:middle line:90%
We always have to improvise.

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And so improvisation
is something

01:19:23.710 --> 01:19:27.130 align:middle line:90%
that we have used as a tool.

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The spiritual force was able
to incorporate elements from

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:34.182 align:middle line:90%
other religions and practices.

01:19:34.182 --> 01:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at
the Haitian art--

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I went and I saw
a show in Paris,

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a show in New York
where people used scraps

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
to assemble these collages,
which is what I do in my work.

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:55.600 align:middle line:84%
My work is not
influenced by writings

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.450 align:middle line:84%
as much as by the
collage, because these are

01:19:57.450 --> 01:19:59.290 align:middle line:90%
the people I knew in New York.

01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The painters were
doing collages.

01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And the musicians were
doing collages in the sense

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that if you listen to John
Coltrane, Miles Davis, and all

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:12.230 align:middle line:84%
of them, they take bits and
snatches from popular tunes.

01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
They were mixing and sampling
before these kids had

01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
these machines and everything.

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> The blues players were also.

01:20:18.890 --> 01:20:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So we have to improvise
in order to stay alive.

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> When we talk about reclaiming
an African-based religion

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and how that religion has
informed the identities

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:45.820 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of Afrocentrists,
for example--

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and what I find interesting
is that the idea of identity

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
becomes meaningless in the face
of a genuine Vodon experience.

01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>> You need an interpretation
of religion that's modern,

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't involve a
lot of paraphernalia.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And I got SU up there.

01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:15.810 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't involve lot
of paraphernalia and ritual.

01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't consider myself
a follower of any religion.

01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:23.850 align:middle line:90%
All these saints require gifts.

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Sustenance.

01:21:24.670 --> 01:21:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think the
mind is like that.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And what one does
is to feed the mind.

01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:32.316 align:middle line:90%


01:21:32.316 --> 01:21:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's my
interpretation of it.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't
feel that religion

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.910 align:middle line:84%
can answer complex questions
about the universe.

>> The mind is a
house of the spirit,

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
unencumbered by trappings
of ritual and dogma.

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the last thought
Ishmael Reed had left me with.

01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I ponder this as I
leave Oakland to explore

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
how this view might play
itself out in contemporary art.

dance combined with a sharp eye

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
for found objects, visual artist
Nick Cave has made a unique

01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
contribution to
American culture,

01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%

01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So we spent a day looking at
your exhibition in Seattle.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to know is
how you made the transition

01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:20.940 align:middle line:90%
from fabric to movement.

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.110 align:middle line:90%
You went to art school.

01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But you also had this
interesting dance.

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And you managed to somehow
find a way to combine the two.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
What was that process,
that growth process?

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I went to art
school to study art.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time studied dance.

01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So I really had these dual
majors at the same time and was

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
interested , in at some point,
the collaboration of these two

01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.630 align:middle line:90%
disciplines.

01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I can look at it as
a sculptural object.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But then I also
can think about it

01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
as something that can
be brought to the body.

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And then how does
the body inform

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that object, may it be
through performance,

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.080 align:middle line:84%
may it be through
photography, may it

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.230 align:middle line:90%
be through collaborations?

story about how you came upon

01:24:42.450 --> 01:24:46.650 align:middle line:90%
the twig sound suit.

01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
You were going through a
period of questioning yourself

01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
or more importantly,
questioning the idea

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of what it meant
to be a black male

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
in this society around the time
of the Rodney King beating.

01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that whole
incident was very emotional,

01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and particularly for
me as a black male.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.880 align:middle line:10%
And to think about the
role of racial profiling--

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.380 align:middle line:10%
what I was responding
to was just the readings

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.080 align:middle line:10%
and just how they brought
description to his character,

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:29.000 align:middle line:10%

out with prison weights.

him down, scary.

visualize what that looked

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.620 align:middle line:10%
like as an image.

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And then created
this suit in response

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
to that looking
at materials that

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:44.930 align:middle line:90%
were discarded, less than--

01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:48.610 align:middle line:90%


01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
I saw it as a sculpture.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think that I could
physically put this thing on.

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.440 align:middle line:90%
And then I put it on.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Then I was thinking, am I making
a second skin, a suit of armor,

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.340 align:middle line:90%
something to protect my spirit?

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to think
about the role of persona

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and hidden identity and the
fact that the sound suits,

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.620 align:middle line:90%
they hide gender, race, class.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:28.100 align:middle line:10%
And so you're forced to
reckon with something

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.960 align:middle line:10%
without judgment.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It made me think about
myself as an artist

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:36.870 align:middle line:84%
differently, that there's
something more behind this

01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:39.478 align:middle line:90%
than I realized.

01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:27.330 align:middle line:90%
from my friend in Mississippi.

I think, Ingrid,
your part's often

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that you use fish
heads in your stuff.

01:28:40.290 --> 01:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I use fish heads, shrimp
shells, and vegetables

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.760 align:middle line:90%

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.420 align:middle line:90%

Well, not even
folklore-- actually,

01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:58.690 align:middle line:84%
when I went to Togo
several years ago,

01:28:58.690 --> 01:29:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get okra stew,
because in Ghana, okra stew

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.450 align:middle line:84%
is a really important
dish that I love.

01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, Ghana
is Anglophone and Togo

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.560 align:middle line:90%
is Francophone.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.910 align:middle line:90%
So I was having a hard time.

01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:14.000 align:middle line:84%
No one knew what I
meant when I said, okra.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, okra, okra stew.

01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And they were like, oh, gumbo.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So I was like,
gumbo au Francais.

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So like I found out then
that the word for okra

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in Francophone West Africa,
Dahomey region is gumbo.

01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And that basically, that's
how gumbo became gumbo

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
in Louisiana, in the
Louisiana bay side,

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.645 align:middle line:84%
in that area, because the
principal ingredient was--

01:29:43.645 --> 01:29:44.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Okra.

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Okra stew.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:50.535 align:middle line:84%
But then there was the
Native American influence

01:29:50.535 --> 01:29:52.610 align:middle line:90%
with the sassafras.

01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:54.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what I came from.

01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:55.450 align:middle line:90%

01:29:55.450 --> 01:29:56.755 align:middle line:90%
>> And I was just curious.

01:29:56.755 --> 01:29:58.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
brought that up,

01:29:58.130 --> 01:30:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I was just curious if the two
of you had the okra gumbo filé.

01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:07.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Ingrid and
I completely have--

01:30:07.824 --> 01:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
no, we just had an argument
about how to make gumbo,

01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:13.600 align:middle line:90%
because I actually did ask--

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.732 align:middle line:90%
I'm using partially her recipe.

01:30:15.732 --> 01:30:17.940 align:middle line:10%
But then she's like, well,
I don't make it like that.

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what's
gumbo without okra.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.124 align:middle line:90%
Gumbo is okra.

01:30:23.124 --> 01:30:24.972 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I understand that.

01:30:24.972 --> 01:30:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Not to deny
traditions, but there's

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who
eat gumbo without okra.

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>> But gumbo is okra.

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:34.153 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be called gumbo
if it didn't have okra in it.

01:30:34.153 --> 01:30:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> But there are
still other kinds--

01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:39.340 align:middle line:90%
there's lots of kinds of gumbo.

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> There are different--

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

>> Would you like to weigh
in on this discussion?

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea of
gumbo, the metaphor

01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a
stew that combines

01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:56.248 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
elements, a lot

01:30:56.248 --> 01:30:59.406 align:middle line:84%

elements and blends them.
