TV, it's just some

shows that you just--
that are pretend.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you explore,
you get more imagination

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle line:90%
than you already had.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
more imagination,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:84%
it makes you want to go deeper
in so you can get more and see

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:84%
beautifuller things, like
the path, if it's a path,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.872 align:middle line:84%
it could lead you to
a beach or something,

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:35.955 align:middle line:90%
and it could be beautiful.

>>You think this is just
another day in your life.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not just another day.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.715 align:middle line:84%
It's the one day that
is given to you today.

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:10%
It's given to you.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.722 align:middle line:84%
It's the only gift that
you have right now.

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:36.957 align:middle line:84%
And the only appropriate
response is gratefulness.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
If you do nothing else but
to cultivate that response

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:84%
to the great gift that this
unique day is, if you learn

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
to respond as if it were
the first day in your life,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:84%
and the very last
day, then you will

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:90%
have spent this day very well.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Begin by opening your eyes and
be surprised that you have eyes

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:90%
you can open.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
That incredible array of
colors that is constantly

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.645 align:middle line:84%
offered to us, for
pure enjoyment.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Look at the sky.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:90%
We so rarely look at the sky.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:84%
We so rarely note how different
it is from moment to moment,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.645 align:middle line:90%
with clouds coming and going.

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:90%
We just think of the weather.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Even with the weather,
we don't think

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of all the many
nuances of weather.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
We just think of good
weather and bad weather.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
This day, right now,
has unique weather.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It may be a kind that will
never exactly in that form

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
come again.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
The formation of
clouds in the sky

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
will never be the same
that it is right now.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.945 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes, look at that.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Look at the faces of
people whom you meet.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Each one has an incredible
story behind their face.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:10%
A story that you could
never fully fathom.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.027 align:middle line:10%
Not only their own story, but
the story of their ancestors.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:10%


00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.756 align:middle line:10%
We all go back so far.

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And in this present moment,
on this day, all the people

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
you meet, all that life from
generations, and from so many

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
places all over the world, flows
together and meets you here

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
like life-giving water, if you
only open your heart and drink.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Open your heart to
the incredible gifts

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.445 align:middle line:90%
that civilization gives to us.

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
You flip a switch, and
there's electric light.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You turn a faucet, and there
is warm water and cold water.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And drinkable water.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a gift that millions
and millions in the world

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:90%
will never experience.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So these are just a few
of an enormous number

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
of gifts to which we
can open your heart.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I wish you that you
will open your heart to all

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.122 align:middle line:84%
these blessings, and let
them flow through you.

00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Then everyone whom you
will meet on this day

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:90%
will be blessed by you.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Just by your eyes, by
your smile, by your touch.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.772 align:middle line:90%
Just by your presence.

00:05:28.772 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Let the gratefulness overflow
into blessing all around you.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Then, it will really
be a good day.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:06:14.336 align:middle line:90%
