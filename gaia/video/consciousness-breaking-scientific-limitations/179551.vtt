[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Science has provided
humanity with an incredible

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.790 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
our physical world.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.790 align:middle line:84%
However, when it comes to
the issue of the human mind,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.540 align:middle line:84%
progress has been slow
and littered with issues.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Materialist science
is attempting

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to prove that
consciousness is merely

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:84%
a byproduct of the complex
processes in the brain

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and that it's inseparable
from the physical body.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
In simpler terms, your mind
is the resulting process

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
of neurons firing
in your brain--

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:90%
nothing more and nothing less.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there is no
actual neurological proof

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:90%
to support this idea.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And for many who
are deeply studying

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
the question of the mind,
these materialist scientists

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
are not looking
in the right place

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:90%
or using the right methods.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Other scientists are
proposing theories

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
of non-local consciousness-- the
idea that our brains are merely

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:84%
the physical conduit
for the mind, not

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:90%
the source of its origin.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
These theories often
explore fringe cases,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
such as near-death
experiences, precognition

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and psychic phenomena,
in hopes that they

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
can provide a more complete
picture of the human mind.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the majority
of this evidence

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.520 align:middle line:84%
is not measurable to the
extent that most mainstream

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
materialist scientists
would accept.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Responding to eyewitness
accounts describing

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
near-death experience,
Neil deGrasse Tyson said,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the lowest forms of
evidence you could possibly

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:90%
invoke is eyewitness testimony.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Just give me something
that does not

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
have to flow
through your senses,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
because your senses are some of
the worst data taking devices

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:90%
that exist.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Modern science did
not receive maturity

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
until we had instruments that
either extended our senses,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:90%
or replaced them.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, from the
simplest microscope

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
to the Large Hadron
Collider, it is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
impossible to imagine
scientific progress

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:90%
without such instruments.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But if our senses are
considered fallible

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
as scientific instruments,
what should we make of the mind

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
we use to process and
interpret this collected data?

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Human consciousness must
be considered as unreliable

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:90%
as our senses--

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
perhaps even more reliable, as
we know far less about the mind

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
than we do about
our sense organs.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
This paradoxical reality is
a serious issue for science.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
How can we study the human
mind if the only tool

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
we have at our disposal
is the human mind itself?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:10%
In his book, Why
Science is Wrong,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:10%
science podcaster Alex
Tsakiris sums up the problem--

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:10%
"if my consciousness is
more than my physical brain,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:10%
then consciousness
is the X factor

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:10%
in every science experiment.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:10%
It's the asterisk in
the footnotes that says,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:10%
we came as close
as we could, but we

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:10%
had to leave out
consciousness in order

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:10%
to make our numbers work."

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Part of this consciousness
problem in scientific study

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:90%
is the observer effect--

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:84%
the theory that simply observing
a situation or phenomenon

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
necessarily changes
that phenomenon.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
On a quantum level,
physicists found

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that even passive observation
of quantum phenomena

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
can change the measured result,
leading to the popular belief

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:84%
that a conscious mind can
directly affect reality.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
If we do, in fact, co-create
a shared consciousness,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
then our beliefs
would necessarily

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:90%
influence our science.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Dan Siegel, a professor of
psychiatry at UCLA School

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of Medicine, has argued for
decades that we cannot simply

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:84%
look inside the brain when
trying to understand the mind.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
"I realized, if someone asked
me to define the coastline,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:84%
but insisted, is it
the water or the sand,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say the
coast is both sand and sea,"

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:90%
says Siegel.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
"I started thinking, maybe the
mind is like the coastline--

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts, feelings,
memories, attention.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
What you experience in
the subjective world

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:90%
is part of mind."

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
For Siegel and others,
it's impossible to conceive

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
of a mind that's purely
inside the brain.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But those exploring
the outer frontiers

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness study
are willing to take

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:90%
this idea much, much further.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Ervin Laszlo, PhD, is
one of many thinkers

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
who proposes the idea of
a cosmic consciousness,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
describing it as a web that
connects the entire universe.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
This conscious field manifests
locally in the human brain,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
theoretically meaning
that the brain is

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:84%
able to connect to
the consciousness

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:90%
of the entire universe.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
In support of his theory, he
presents numerous case studies

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.420 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiences,
after death communication,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and recollections of past
lives, as well as cutting edge

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:90%
research in quantum mechanics.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Laszlo writes, "we are beginning
to see the entire universe

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
as a holographically
inter-linked network of energy

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:90%
and information.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:10%
We, and all things
in the universe,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.170 align:middle line:10%
are non-locally
connected with each other

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:10%
and with all other
things in ways

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:10%
that are unfettered by the
hitherto known limitations

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:10%
of space and time."

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Those known limitations
of space and time

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
are the border walls
of materialist science,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and in the last century,
quantum mechanics

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.320 align:middle line:84%
has begun to tear that wall
down, one brick at a time.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement proves that
tiny particles can communicate

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously in defiance
of our known rules of space

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and time.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Many have hypothesized that if
these tiny particles can remain

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
connected outside of
standard physical means,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
then the entire universe is
inherently connected as Laszlo

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and others have suggested.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And while that may
someday be proven true,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
we have barely
scratched the surface

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the quantum
implications of the mind.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Although there is
extensive evidence

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:84%
for non-local consciousness,
it is rarely embraced

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:84%
by mainstream
scientists, because it

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
can't be measured using
currently available technology.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And that makes significant
progress challenging.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Accepting nonlocality
forces the rejection

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
of a purely
materialist worldview,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and that is a huge disruption
for our current scientific

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:90%
paradigm.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Yet the study of
consciousness is slowly

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
forcing materialistic
science to admit it may not

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:90%
be able to explain everything.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
As Nikola Tesla famously
said, "the day science begins

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to study nonphysical
phenomena, it

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
will make more
progress in one decade

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.990 align:middle line:84%
than in all the previous
centuries of its existence."

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:84%
The study of human
consciousness could

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
be the motivating factor pushing
us towards that new frontier.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:90%
