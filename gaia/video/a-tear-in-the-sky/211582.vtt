>> Weird, kind of amorphous
opalescent kind of thing.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:10%

It was coming in very fast.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:10%
>> It was staying perfectly
still and stationary in the sky

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:10%
for about four to five minutes,
until it started to move.

>> Made a hard right turn,
went up like 90 degrees.

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
They figured that it was
traveling at something

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:90%
like 800 miles an hour.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:10%

changed formation.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:10%
First, it was vertical,
then it went lateral

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:10%
and then they changed to
like a rectangle shape

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:10%

away from the others.

>> I started out at a very young
age witnessing anomalous events

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:10%
such as UFOs.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:10%
And that's what got me
interested in the field

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:10%
of ufology.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I became a researcher
and a speaker.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the years, I have
come across hundreds of people

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
from all walks of life, from
all around the world who

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
also have had similar
experiences, witnessing UFOs.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this
phenomenon is not new.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
It's very old and
very widespread,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
yet this entire subject has
been lacking credibility

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance from society but
also from the establishment.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until 2017 when
The New York Times came out

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
with an article featuring three
leaked videos from the US Navy

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that totally defied explanation,
that the conversation began

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.822 align:middle line:90%
to shift.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:90%

>> Roger that.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.615 align:middle line:90%
They start shooting--

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>> They are all going
against the wind.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:90%
The wind's 120 miles west.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, if there's
anything, it's rotating.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole fleet of them.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.445 align:middle line:90%
Look on MSA.

00:02:57.445 --> 00:02:58.245 align:middle line:90%

material, top secret
data recording.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:10%
In November in 2004,
we were doing workups

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.045 align:middle line:10%
in preparation for
our next deployment.

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I was on the USS Princeton.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:10%
I was the leading
operations specialist.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:10%
And basically, we control the
radars, we man the radars.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:10%
We fight the ship if
we ever go to combat.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:10%
My primary job was to
identify everything

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:10%
that flew in the sky.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
On November 10th,
I started to notice

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
some really strange contacts
off the coast of Catalina.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> During those workups,
we tracked unknown aircraft

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
for several days.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the context here--
at 28,000 feet going south about

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
100 knots, and I'm
thinking to myself,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I never seen anything
fly like that.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I had 15 and 1/2
years actual sea time

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
sitting behind that radar.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:10%
At one point, it
was raining UFOs.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:10%
I'd never seen
anything fly like this.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And all the other ships
are tracking it too.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.665 align:middle line:84%
Fast Eagle flight
happened to be airborne.

00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:10%
Commander Fravor, the
first one to launch off

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:10%
the Nimitz aircraft carrier.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:10%
These objects fell out.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:10%
These things went straight
back up to 28,000 feet

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:10%
again in less than a second.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And then at the very end, it
was right in front of him.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Disappeared.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:84%
>> They exhibited flight
capabilities that were well

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything that
I'd ever seen before.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty familiar with
just about the fastest things

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And these things kind of made
them look like they're toys.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Because these videos were
taken by military servicemen,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
the Navy and the Pentagon
eventually confirmed

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:90%
the veracity of these sightings.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Senator Reid, Senator
Rubio and others

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
prompted Congress to
investigate these events

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and publish an official
report on these findings.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:10%
Even though multiple credible
cases were investigated,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:10%
the UAP Report--

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:10%
Unidentified Aerial
Phenomenon, turned out

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:10%
to be inconclusive, which
unfortunately did not

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:10%
surprise many of us
in the UFO community.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:10%
>> When you don't know
what it is, of course,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:10%
nothing can be
conclusively ruled out.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Can they come up
with any explanation?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Really just a fraction of
evidence the government has

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.340 align:middle line:10%
on UFOs.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:10%
>> What does the US
government know about UFOs?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Had that bombshell not
come out in The New York Times

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:10%
and Politico and CNN, we
wouldn't be where we are today.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:10%
The Pentagon has not
been forthcoming at all.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
They have been a huge
pain in the ass regarding

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:90%
this topic, massively.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
needed with this topic--

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:90%
real evidence, real data.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:90%
However long it takes.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.435 align:middle line:84%
That's the stuff that
becomes foolproof.

00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The next morning, I get
up I say, what the heck?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write a very
detailed message about what

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I went back up the Combat
Information Center, CIC.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of the lead technicians,
he looks at me and says,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.797 align:middle line:84%
so chief, the data isn't
on the ship anymore.

00:05:55.797 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are you--
what are you talking about?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, somebody
came on-board our ship

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:90%
and they took our data.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they made
us erase everything

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
down in the computer room, even
black tapes had gotten erased.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We had our data recording for
all of our equipment taken off

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:90%
the ship.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
we were ordered

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to erase everything that
was left in the shop.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And for them to take
it, it was highly unusual.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I raised my hand
and said, I think

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:90%
we've got a safety issue here.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And I would try to
describe what happened.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And I got laughed at.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:90%
I got ridiculed.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:90%
There was jokes posted.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
There were cartoons
posted about me.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And I got--

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:90%
I got so frustrated.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:90%
It ended my career.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of my shipmates
lost careers, lost wives,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
lost the ability to be
able to see their children.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
consequences of these events

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
that happen that we're
told to not talk about.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was really scary.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:90%
It was really lonely.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I
ended up, I didn't

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:90%
know what I was going to do.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I had gone through all this
pain and suffering, if you will.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It is unimaginable to think
that a UFO encounter could

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
affect these guys to such a
point that they would lose

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
their careers, they would lose
their personal and social life.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I feel even more determined
to help find some answers

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:90%
about their experience.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:10%
I feel after all these years,
if the government is not

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:10%
officially at a point where
they can offer real answers

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:10%
to these very widespread
sightings, well maybe,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:10%
it is up to us to
look into the subject

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:10%
but from a new
scientific perspective.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Because that has
never been done.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I decided to take
on this challenge.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find a way to team
up with scientists and experts

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
on this and see if we can
capture these objects ourselves

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:90%
and offer some answers.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But first, I want
to invite someone

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:90%
that I really, really love--

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:90%
William Shatner.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I met him on multiple
projects, because he is

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:90%
the icon of the sci-fi world.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And he also has been involved in
the world of ufology and world

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%
mysteries for a long time.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I think his insight
is going to be

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
fantastic to help us
bridge the gap from sci-fi

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:90%
to real science.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:84%
And that will give us an
additional perspective

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:43.269 align:middle line:84%
on what this UFO UAP
phenomenon is really about.

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:10%
>> What has made mankind
is an insatiable curiosity,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:10%
insatiable.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows the phenomena.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> This time, we're
talking about UFOs.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the government is
coming up with all these videos

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:90%
and saying it's real.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, they're saying it's
real, that that it's really

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:90%
an unidentified flying object.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Have you seen the UAP report?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It's inconclusive.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:10%
So we're very frustrated--

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what do
you want to see?

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Data.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Data.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that there were a
lot of very credible cases--

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Air Force pilots,
Navy, Military.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There are so many of
those credible cases

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that you would think by now, we
have some sort of investigation

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and data reporting--

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:90%
They had investigations.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
You would think by now
that they would say,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
here's a piece of
something or here is--

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>> So I had an idea.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is?

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it was a good one.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought we need to go
all the way and do something

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:90%
at a much bigger scale.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We need to do a
scientific investigation.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that's marvelous.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Those Navy pilots were
off of the coast of Catalina.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:10%
And this is where they saw these
Tic Tac videos and other Navy

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:10%
ships as well, all
in the same area.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of
what I'm thinking.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:84%
We put a team of scientists,
experts, military folks

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:84%
as well, since they
have the experience,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and attempt to capture
something in real time.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:90%
If you could hone in--

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Electronically and visually--

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> On some unidentified
flying object,

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:90%
you'd certainly have made news.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The Tic Tac
video, for example.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
There is no other angles
of the same object.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any sort
of radiation detection.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any--

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't have a triangulation.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't have
any triangulation.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Although, the radar picked
it up as well as the cameras

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
on the ships if
I'm not mistaken.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:90%
All you need is a phenomena.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like you
think it's a good idea?

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's a wonderful idea.

00:11:12.388 --> 00:11:13.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:11:13.188 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't tell you
how much I'm looking forward

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to hearing and hopefully
seeing what you've uncovered.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what we need-- the
smoking gun that will clinch

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:10%
it, that once and for all
will settle the debate.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:10%
No ifs, ands, or buts.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.175 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, rewrite
all of human history.

00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:41.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I was ecstatic to find out
that the Navy personnel from

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:84%
the USS Nimitz encounter had
created the UAPx team with

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
renowned scientists and experts
to research the UFO phenomenon

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:84%
in more depth and with rigorous
scientific methodologies.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So the UAPx team was the perfect
fit for this first expedition.

00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh they're here, Gary.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, Gary.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:10%
Nice to meet you.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Nice to meet you in person.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Kevin.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Kevin, nice to meet you.

00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:22.635 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:12:22.635 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:90%
This is Jeremy.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to meet you.

00:12:24.273 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jeremy.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Kevin.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. Voorhis.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Glad to meet you.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the guys who
were on the USS Princeton

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:90%
everybody's been talking about.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So why should we work with
anybody else but the real folks

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.522 align:middle line:90%
who lived it?

00:12:39.522 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> You guys started it.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And so this moment
is very exciting for me,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:84%
because if you want to bring
credibility to this phenomenon,

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:90%
you have to go all the way.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean it has to be big.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.698 align:middle line:90%
It has to be scientific.

00:12:53.698 --> 00:12:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the very reason
why we started our company is

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
have those answers.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We agree.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.853 align:middle line:84%
>> It was great that they came
out and let everybody know this

00:13:00.853 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:90%
was a real thing.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:90%
But there needs to be more done.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, video is one thing.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to get more data.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Personally thinking, we need
to go back to where you guys

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:90%
were--

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Southern California.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:90%
What do you suggest?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:90%
What do you think we should do?

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well we got a couple
locations on that we kind

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:84%
of thought that we're going to
do good coverage of the South

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:90%
part of the island.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Ideally, Caroline, if we
could get a house on the beach

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:84%
right here somewhere,
that would be ideal.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe a place with
a flat roof on Catalina.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Our third location
could be on the truck.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we do have two
stationary positions,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and then we have
Jeremy in one spot,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
we could potentially achieve
some sort of triangulation,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.965 align:middle line:90%
which is very, very important--

00:13:45.965 --> 00:13:46.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:47.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>> In collecting data.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.085 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the day,
who do we have on the team?

00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've got
myself Gary Voorhis.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:90%
We've got Kevin Day.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.525 align:middle line:90%
We've got Jason Turner.

00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And we were all on
the Princeton together.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We also have Dave
Altman and Michael Hall,

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
both experienced
UFO researchers.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Then we have our
scientists Kevin Knuth

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:84%
who is an associate
professor in physics

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and an expert in
exoplanet research.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We also have Matthew Szydagis,
an associate professor

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:90%
in physics.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
His expertise is in dark
matter, radiation detection.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Then we have David Mason.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
He's invented several
of the devices that

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:84%
can detect communication
patterns coming from UAP.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So we have optical.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:90%
We have acoustic.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:90%
What else we got?

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> We got thermal.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We've got everything
we can throw at it.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> With all this equipment and
all of us over five days, 24/7,

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
if we don't see something, I'm
going to be very disappointed.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:10%

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:90%

Jason, anything to report?

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:10%
I think we're all good.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:10%
Let's get it going.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.577 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's work hard.

00:21:44.577 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's get everything
up and running by noon.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.135 align:middle line:84%
We need to get as much
as possible time, data

00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle line:90%
recording while we're here.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:90%
This is our opportunity.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's get it done.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Half of our equipment
is experimental.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
The other half is, well, some
of it's old and some of it's not

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:90%
and some of it's cutting edge.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's just a matter of--

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.500 align:middle line:90%
hopefully, it will all work.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.758 align:middle line:90%

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:90%

airspace over top of us.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:10%
So you guys-- this is
actually the little brother

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:10%
of what I've got
in the O.S.I.R.I.S.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
We've got the magnetometers.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:90%
We've got the GPS.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
We've got wireless connectivity.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We've got all the
barometric pressure,

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:90%
weather indicators, ADSB.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
We can track known
aircraft with this.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And the best part about
this is, I can see this,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I can control this
from the O.S.I.R.I.S.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So if this thing is
putting out any signals,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get it.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>> One of my friends,
Travis Taylor,

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:10%
who is an astrophysicist has
been involved in studying

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:10%
anomalous events and UAPs
from a scientific perspective

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:10%
for a long time.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I would invite
him to check out our setup

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and get his take on some of the
new technology and equipment we

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.748 align:middle line:90%
brought along.

00:23:25.748 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm really optimistic.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:90%

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, Trav, it's
been a long time.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Two years, I think
since the conference.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's been
a couple of years.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:90%

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> This is David Mason.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
He's the brains behind
all the inventions,

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:84%
but we have two major

Wait until you see
what's upstairs.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy stuff.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you like
to give him a tour?

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'd love to see it.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm really excited to
see the instrumentation,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.360 align:middle line:10%
the planning that these guys
have put into this experiment

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.388 align:middle line:10%
is going to change the
culture in the world.

00:24:06.388 --> 00:24:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are going to
have to start taking this

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
more seriously, if
we're going to get

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom of the phenomenon.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So I hear some
chirps and clicks.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:10%
>> The chirps are gamma
radiation which are higher

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:10%
energy particles and then the
clicking is the beta radiation.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:90%
That's your software energy.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.708 align:middle line:84%
>> What part of the spectrum
are you able to look at?

00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> From about 10 megahertz
up to about 2 gigahertz.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can see all the
radio stations and TV stations

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and Ham bands and everything
that everybody would use.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So if something's there
that shouldn't be there,

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:90%
then you'll see it.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:36.442 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> So what else you got here?

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:84%
We've got eight FLIR
thermal cameras running.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see pretty
much the whole sky and FLIR

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:90%
if you want to at night.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Normally, UAP researchers
have one FLIR looking like that

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:90%
way or that way.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can look
all over, right?

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the unknown objects
I have recorded often register

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:90%
temperatures -20 Fahrenheit.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:10%
I've even had some down
to -80 Fahrenheit, which

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:10%
is just extraordinarily
cold, exhibit no

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:10%
exhaust and no
explanation for it.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> So what's this thing.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a light
wave transmitter.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have a-- it's
connected to a laser

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:10%
>> That's connected to a light
wave transmitter assembly.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be an
oddity about them,

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
because people report
that they pulsate.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And my theory is that there
must be some sort of information

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:90%
or data.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So what if a UAP is
off in the distance,

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's modulating
its brightness,

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:84%
changing its brightness
with an information pattern.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:84%
They're communicating
with us, right?

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you convert
that to sound,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
our brains and our ears and
various computer algorithms

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:90%
could find a pattern in that.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.978 align:middle line:84%
>> We can also take that sound
that we receive and put it

00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:90%
right back on the transmitter--

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And send it right back to it.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right back to them.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.325 align:middle line:84%
So if they're sending out
data we don't understand,

00:25:52.325 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:90%
we can say, here you go.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, see, and that's
the first protocol in any

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:90%
As you say hello, world.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:84%
If you hear hello,
world, you say hello,

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:90%
world right back to them.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.690 align:middle line:10%
So what's really
cool about this is,

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:10%
you've got a capability here
to maybe detect communications

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:10%
and rebroadcast
those communications

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.090 align:middle line:10%
in both electromagnetic, our
radio station, microwave,

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:10%
all that, optical, ultraviolet,
visible, and infrared light,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:10%
as well as temperature.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That gives you a broad range of
where potential communications

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea how the
UAPs might be communicating.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm really impressed.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:90%
This is exciting.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait
to see it working.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.262 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we see
a UAP and talk to it.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:90%

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:20.550 align:middle line:10%

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.440 align:middle line:10%
And it has some motion to it.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:10%
It looks like it rotates
or tilts and appears

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.772 align:middle line:10%
and then dissipates
out of the frame.

00:38:31.772 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:10%

the other things you showed me.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Another interesting fact
about this is that this

>> Yeah.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they're triangulating
from their perspective,

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and then we're triangulating
and converging at two points.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.440 align:middle line:10%
>> That would mean that we
have seen the same object,

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:10%
not only from different angles
but also three different

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.580 align:middle line:10%
wavelengths, visible light,
and two different kinds

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:10%
of infrared, right?

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.380 align:middle line:10%
So that is unprecedented in
the history of UAP research.

different wavelengths,
including radiation,

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:10%
that's just phenomenal.

>> In science, it's
very important,

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:52.150 align:middle line:10%
especially when studying
an unknown phenomenon,

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:56.380 align:middle line:10%
to be able to have multiple
different modes or modalities

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:10%
of studying it and being able
to look at correlations between

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.040 align:middle line:10%
different devices that are
studying the same phenomenon.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.715 align:middle line:10%
This reduces the probability of
equipment malfunction, glitches

00:40:07.715 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:10%
and things like that.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.720 align:middle line:10%
Because the
probability was greatly

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:10%
reduced of something being
accidental if you can see it

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.816 align:middle line:10%
across different
devices, especially

00:40:17.816 --> 00:40:21.940 align:middle line:10%
if those different devices are
based on different technologies

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.200 align:middle line:10%

6:07 PM, a high energy
radiation registers 32.32 MeV.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.980 align:middle line:84%
6:09 PM, we capture
another Tic Tac

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.140 align:middle line:90%
like object traveling sideways.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.780 align:middle line:10%
Could this be the
same Navy Tic Tacs

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.530 align:middle line:10%
that were observed in
2004 by the USS Nimitz

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:10%
then by other ships from
2014 all the way to 2019?

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.090 align:middle line:10%
That would be incredible.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:10%
Later that evening, at
9:29 PM, the Catalina Team

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.050 align:middle line:10%
captures an anomalous object--

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:18.820 align:middle line:10%
solid in color, on two night
vision cameras and one CCD

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.570 align:middle line:10%
camera, which correlates
with a solid object caught

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:10%
on our FLIR camera.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Now this object
registers cold, which

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
means it has no propulsion
system that we know of.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.030 align:middle line:10%
The object suddenly
disappears simultaneously

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.550 align:middle line:10%
out of sight from
the multiple angles.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.940 align:middle line:10%
Even more intriguing is
that at the same time,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.660 align:middle line:10%
the O.S.I.R.I.S registers
one anomalous object

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.360 align:middle line:10%
on one camera,
but not the other.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.170 align:middle line:84%
These are very intriguing,
very compelling events

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and astounding correlations.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I think today was a breakthrough
in our expedition and research.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I am very hopeful we're
finally on the right track

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:84%
in uncovering what these
Tic Tac objects may be

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.830 align:middle line:84%
or at least getting more
evidential data on UAPs

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:09.655 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs.

00:42:09.655 --> 00:42:13.130 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes just one credible
irrefutable piece of evidence

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:90%
to change all of world history.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The entire literature
of the human race

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:28.040 align:middle line:84%
would have to be changed if
we had just one incident that

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:90%
is irrefutable.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Science is also about
the skills of data analysis.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the hardware,
it's the software.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't just mean
computer software.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:41.750 align:middle line:10%
I mean, our human minds
and our intelligence

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.490 align:middle line:10%
and applying it to
analyzing the data.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:10%
So here's the first
one right here.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.230 align:middle line:10%
And the night was pretty clear.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.590 align:middle line:10%
So you have to be
careful not to be

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:55.010 align:middle line:10%
fooled by a lot of fuzzy
splotches, obviously stars.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:84%
You also see a lot of
fast objects go by,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.170 align:middle line:84%
which I'm pretty
sure are meteors.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> But what is that?

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's very odd.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What is that
slow moving object?

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's changing speed.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It just slowed down and
curved a little bit.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.153 align:middle line:84%
>> It's changing angle,
and it's not blinking.

00:43:10.153 --> 00:43:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not blinking
like an airplane

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.880 align:middle line:90%
would with airplane lights.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Part of the scientific
analysis is to carefully rule

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:10%
out objects that can
easily be taken for UFOs.

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:10%
For example, human-made
advanced technology

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:10%
or a mirage-like
object or an orb

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:33.260 align:middle line:10%
that can easily mimic a
UFO, because of reflectivity

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:10%
or some other atmospheric event.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a phenomena
that you haven't mentioned--

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that
whales sing songs.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
whales can hear them

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:84%
across the ocean
1,000 miles away.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The sound bounces
off layers of water

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.200 align:middle line:84%
of different
temperatures, and then can

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:90%
be heard many miles away.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.130 align:middle line:84%
That same phenomenon applies
to light, you're aware of that,

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:06.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Fata Morgana is a mirage
when people and I've

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:90%
seen this myself.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I've seen something on
a rock or some distance

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.120 align:middle line:90%
away in the desert.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.760 align:middle line:10%
And you could sometimes
see a weird thing.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you came upon
it, it disappeared.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Something happening over there.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.220 align:middle line:10%
The light bounces off a
hot layer of air over there

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.910 align:middle line:10%
and appears over here.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So those floating
ships that we've seen,

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:84%
mirages and many, many other
objects, the explanation

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:49.570 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of phenomena
are natural and explicable.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:54.880 align:middle line:10%
Now it's also possible
that some of the phenomena

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.480 align:middle line:10%
aren't explained.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:10%
And that's what you're
applying yourself to.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.540 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the idea
of this research,

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.590 align:middle line:10%
is to explain the explainable
that the average person would

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:06.970 align:middle line:10%
think is an anomaly.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:07.940 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, it's not.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> When the normal, average
person looks up at the night

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.510 align:middle line:84%
sky, or even the daytime sky,
and they see something that

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.470 align:middle line:84%
confuses them, typically,
they're making the cognitive

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.390 align:middle line:90%
jump right to UAP.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you for a 100%
fact that we have technology

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that does some crazy things
that looks so unconventional

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
that the vast majority of
the citizenry in this country

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what's actually
flying in our skies.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, Northrop
Grumman's X-47B.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:47.550 align:middle line:10%
This is a Mach 0.9
plus-capable aircraft.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.910 align:middle line:84%
It is shaped almost in
an equilateral triangle.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:84%
This thing has a service ceiling
of roughly 40 to 50,000 feet.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So at that altitude, you're
not going to hear sound.

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing that
a person may be seeing

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.630 align:middle line:84%
is just the reflection
of ambient light

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:84%
from the surface of
the aircraft which

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.510 align:middle line:84%
makes it look as if there is
an illuminated triangle flying

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:10.590 align:middle line:90%
across the sky.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the other
examples of a drone

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that most people don't know
about is Northrop Grumman's Bat

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.500 align:middle line:90%
They're much, much smaller.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The Bat could probably fit
in the trunk of my vehicle.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So these things can be launched
from a catapult on a ship

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:32.070 align:middle line:84%
without having to have a
runway or a flight deck.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.380 align:middle line:84%
They are propeller powered,
electrically driven,

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and they have an endurance
of up to 18 hours.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is a drone that
has a small battery pack,

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.530 align:middle line:84%
but it still maintains a
very robust sensor capability

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and an extended duration of
almost 20 hours of flight time,

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.750 align:middle line:84%
giving it the capability of
getting out to sea, potentially

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.690 align:middle line:84%
swarming around the
vessel and returning.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.330 align:middle line:84%
The things that the
Tic Tac was doing

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:04.920 align:middle line:84%
in my understanding of
aircraft and flight dynamics

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.866 align:middle line:90%
we still are not at that level.

00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:11.247 align:middle line:10%

00:47:16.077 --> 00:47:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for coming out, Ryan.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No problem.

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:21.785 align:middle line:84%
I'll sit down and pick your
brain for a little while.

00:47:21.785 --> 00:47:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds good.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.340 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.260 align:middle line:10%
So it's been a while.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It has been.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for
coming by, shipmate.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you
visiting us here

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.520 align:middle line:90%
while we're doing our research.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.220 align:middle line:84%
You were on board
when Commander Fravor

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:84%
did his famous intercept and
the Tic Tac video was created.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Could you walk me through
exactly how you found out

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.090 align:middle line:10%
and what you were
doing on board.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I honestly never had met you,
and it's a pretty small ship.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I was part of the
air detachment.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I was leading Petty Officer
of HSL-43's detachment

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.290 align:middle line:84%
on board you guys
with the Princeton.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I had actually been
in combat at the time

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.480 align:middle line:84%
on the phone with the command
back home because we needed

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.870 align:middle line:90%
something for our aircraft.

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So we were working out
the logistics of that.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.732 align:middle line:84%
During that time frame,
the intercept was going on.

00:48:05.732 --> 00:48:08.190 align:middle line:84%
There was radar screen, so I
was able to see that and then,

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:09.523 align:middle line:90%
of course, all of the commotion.

00:48:09.523 --> 00:48:14.192 align:middle line:84%
And what was going on around
me during that time frame

00:48:14.192 --> 00:48:15.275 align:middle line:90%
was definitely heightened.

00:48:15.275 --> 00:48:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you there when the
civilians that come on board?

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I refer to them now as the men
in khaki because, you know?

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I was there
when they showed up.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I was in the hangar
during flight ops.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.510 align:middle line:84%
They came in, walked pretty
much straight out of the hangar

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and left, came back a short
time later with some bags

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:37.330 align:middle line:90%
and took off.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I can fill you in
on what they took.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know you can do that.

00:48:40.562 --> 00:48:42.020 align:middle line:84%

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:48.410 align:middle line:84%

video and the Gimbal videos

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff that we know
about what actually happened

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and the flight characteristics
of what it could actually do.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:49:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You being really familiar with
aircraft being in the air deck,

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:90%
what did you think about it?

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:05.870 align:middle line:10%
>> What I thought about it is
there's absolutely no aircraft

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:09.140 align:middle line:10%
that can do what those things
we're doing that I know

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.520 align:middle line:10%
of or have seen.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So no nobody wants
to be the UFO guy.

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:15.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is just--

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.590 align:middle line:84%
it's usually hard to
talk about anyways.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.938 align:middle line:84%
What made you be able to get
over all that to talk about it?

00:49:21.938 --> 00:49:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Was there a real big stigma
in the air deck about stuff

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.715 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:49:24.715 --> 00:49:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's always a
stigma when you talk about UFOs.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
people believe you or not,

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
something for it.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I was planning on
making a full second career

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.820 align:middle line:10%
in the Department of
Defense as a contractor.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.010 align:middle line:10%
But because I was
clowned and ridiculed

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:10%
and lost my reputation a little
bit, it destroyed me almost.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.190 align:middle line:10%
I saw this video on the TV.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.540 align:middle line:10%
I was like, oh, my [MUTED] God.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.410 align:middle line:10%
It's happening.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.140 align:middle line:10%
And I dropped a plate of food,
and I jumped on the internet

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.890 align:middle line:10%
and found out what
had just happened.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.640 align:middle line:84%
That moment shook me
to the core because I

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.650 align:middle line:84%
knew my life was
about to change again.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I had gone through all this
pain and suffering, if you will.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:08.575 align:middle line:90%
So I feel validated right now.

00:50:08.575 --> 00:50:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> My thing is I saw what I saw,
and I can't unsee what I saw.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:18.330 align:middle line:10%
And if I saw it then it happened
and I want to back that up.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:22.710 align:middle line:10%
>> For me, I was lucky that I
didn't have the level of PTSD

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.100 align:middle line:10%
that some of the other guys did.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But instead of trying to make
this public, I internalized.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:34.410 align:middle line:84%
For a long time after the event,
I was emotionally completely

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:35.400 align:middle line:90%
void.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really care honestly
whether I lived or died

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.990 align:middle line:84%
or whether or not anybody wanted
to have a relationship with me,

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:48.130 align:middle line:84%
nor was I capable
of having any type

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:90%
of interpersonal relationship.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to tell the truth
about the things that we see.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and that's the one
thing that really bugs a lot

00:50:55.050 --> 00:51:00.480 align:middle line:10%
of us about that too, is that
we couldn't tell the whole truth

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.280 align:middle line:10%
about things.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.620 align:middle line:10%
And if you did, nobody
would believe you

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.390 align:middle line:10%
because the government
didn't tell the truth either.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:51:04.915 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you want to see what
we've got going on upstairs?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'd love to see it.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.508 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, let's go do it.

00:51:09.508 --> 00:51:14.992 align:middle line:90%

finding out what these Navy Tic

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:30.260 align:middle line:10%
in a way, in coming to terms
with the event that changed

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.520 align:middle line:10%
their lives.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.340 align:middle line:84%

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of the puzzle that
will hopefully

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:84%
someday bring some answers
to these very strange events.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.220 align:middle line:10%
I am getting really
excited about the results

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.270 align:middle line:10%
we have so far.

Hopefully, we'll
have more tomorrow.

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.980 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, David
Mason's inventions

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.920 align:middle line:10%
that convert light to
sound and sound to light

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.130 align:middle line:10%
have been operational 24/7.

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:07.200 align:middle line:10%
They've been capturing
the light that

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.680 align:middle line:10%
comes from objects in the
sky and retransmitting

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.250 align:middle line:10%
the same pattern back
to space non-stop.

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I decided to give
it a try and see

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.980 align:middle line:84%
if we could capture the
sound of an anomalous object

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and broadcast our own music and
sound back to them in space.

00:52:27.215 --> 00:52:28.130 align:middle line:10%
This is, of course--

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.520 align:middle line:10%
>> That's Altair.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.460 align:middle line:10%
>> --which star is that--

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.627 align:middle line:10%
>> You're looking at Altair.

00:52:30.627 --> 00:52:32.892 align:middle line:10%
So if you aim the
goggles and keep it

00:52:32.892 --> 00:52:34.100 align:middle line:10%
in the center field of view--

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:34.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, right.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.075 align:middle line:90%

00:52:36.075 --> 00:52:37.095 align:middle line:90%

00:52:37.095 --> 00:52:40.251 align:middle line:84%
>> You can hear
the rumble from it.

00:52:40.251 --> 00:52:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there's an airplane.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I can hear the
airplane it's different.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Can you see over
there, over there?

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Can you see?

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.232 align:middle line:90%
It's getting a different sound.

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:51.080 align:middle line:84%

could be a satellite.

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:10%
How cool?

[LAUGHS]

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.310 align:middle line:90%
So is this the middle one?

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that the visible light?

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So we have two different types
of music being transmitted

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.670 align:middle line:90%
on two different spectrums.

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:08.337 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
like radio stations

00:53:08.337 --> 00:53:09.670 align:middle line:90%
that have different frequencies.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So that way, we can separate
them out and just put out

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:12.530 align:middle line:90%
different data.

David Mason's inventions.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:84%
If we are able to capture the
sound of objects in the sky,

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:26.430 align:middle line:84%
then we can potentially identify
the acoustic pattern of a UFO

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.740 align:middle line:84%

more information

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.020 align:middle line:84%
about the properties
of these objects.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And the music that we broadcast
can reach all points in space,

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and potentially a UFO
would receive our music

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:90%
as a mode of communication.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully it will attempt
to communicate back with us here

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:45.570 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:49.290 align:middle line:84%
The only way to find out if
this mode of communication works

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is to keep the devices
running continuously

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and see if we can then correlate
them with an actual UFO

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.490 align:middle line:90%
sighting in a measurable way.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:02.190 align:middle line:90%

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.435 align:middle line:90%

00:55:43.065 --> 00:55:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a heli.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Helicopter.

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:45.330 align:middle line:90%

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:45.815 align:middle line:90%

00:55:45.815 --> 00:55:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> But wait.

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Just messing with you, man.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Couldn't this be
corporate espionage?

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:52.035 align:middle line:90%
>> I called the company.

00:55:52.035 --> 00:55:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> --not much of
a corporation yet.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.100 align:middle line:84%
That's a video of it
going over the top of us.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.195 align:middle line:90%
>> That's crazy.

00:55:57.195 --> 00:55:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.595 align:middle line:90%
Get back to work, man.

00:55:59.595 --> 00:56:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> So, Gary.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Navy guy walks into a bar.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.550 align:middle line:84%
He's got a 3 foot salami
under one arm and a poodle

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:06.380 align:middle line:90%
under the other.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like a good time.

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.384 align:middle line:90%

00:56:14.758 --> 00:56:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> This has been hard because
it's a huge amount of work,

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.210 align:middle line:84%
a huge amount of
data and equipment.

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'm getting really excited
because David Mason tells me

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.215 align:middle line:84%
he recorded a flurry of
raining objects falling down

00:56:30.215 --> 00:56:31.015 align:middle line:90%
from the sky.

00:56:31.015 --> 00:56:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Kevin Day said at one point
it was raining Tic Tacs.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if these
are the same raining Tic

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Tacs that Kevin Day
was talking about.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But it sure sounds
very intriguing,

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:48.516 align:middle line:90%
and I can't wait to find out.

00:56:48.516 --> 00:56:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you guys got?

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got something really
interesting here, Gary.

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, watch the screen.

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:56.060 align:middle line:84%
What we have is
objects that appear

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.650 align:middle line:90%
to be dropping from the sky.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:90%
And do you see that?

00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah--

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.985 align:middle line:84%
>> --there momentarily and looks
like they're actually dropping

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:02.940 align:middle line:90%
into the ocean.

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> That's crazy.

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've looked at
this and I'm thinking,

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:08.390 align:middle line:90%
could this be a camera artifact?

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:11.425 align:middle line:84%
However, there's a
transition of decay time.

00:57:11.425 --> 00:57:12.425 align:middle line:90%
So this is very strange.

00:57:12.425 --> 00:57:16.070 align:middle line:10%
>> So could these be like
ice forming and dropping

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:17.540 align:middle line:10%
into the water or I mean--

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.660 align:middle line:10%
>> No, because what we're also
seeing is it's transitioning

00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.990 align:middle line:10%
where it's appearing in the
field of view momentarily

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:25.280 align:middle line:10%
and then disappearing.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.915 align:middle line:10%
But it's clearly having a
trajectory that's downward.

00:57:27.915 --> 00:57:31.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm seeing them come in and
then out and then in again when

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:31.850 align:middle line:10%
they hit the water.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>> It looks like
they hit the water.

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:34.820 align:middle line:10%
It looks like they
illuminate in the water.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:35.720 align:middle line:10%
>> That's amazing.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Does this remind
you of anything?

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure it does.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of the
Tic Tacs from '04.

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They would go from 28,000 feet
down to sea level like that,

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just straight
down, just like that.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I first saw the first group
of those whatever they were

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.130 align:middle line:90%
on the 10th of November.

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And the intercept with fast to
go flight happened on the 14th.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And I continued to
see these things up

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.980 align:middle line:84%
until about the
19th of November.

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were always
in groups of 5 to 10.

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:06.513 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to
add up all the groups,

00:58:06.513 --> 00:58:08.180 align:middle line:84%
it was about a hundred
of these objects.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.980 align:middle line:10%
>> There were dozens of
such tracks like this,

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:14.120 align:middle line:10%
which correlate not only with
high energies but also high

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.860 align:middle line:10%
rates in the cosmic watch.

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>> After we examined the
videos that we recorded,

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:22.190 align:middle line:10%
we were able to calculate
the size of the objects based

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:26.960 align:middle line:10%
on the camera field of view and
the distance of the horizon.

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.400 align:middle line:10%
We found that the objects
were at least 4 feet across

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.460 align:middle line:10%
and falling at least
at 5,000 miles an hour.

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And the objects
that were distant

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:40.670 align:middle line:10%
were measured out
at 69 feet across

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:44.790 align:middle line:10%
and falling at a speed of at
least 84,000 miles per hour.

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:48.800 align:middle line:10%
So even if we were off
in calculations by 50%,

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.960 align:middle line:10%
we have some
extraordinary numbers

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.810 align:middle line:10%
that can't explain this
phenomenon as being something

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:55.620 align:middle line:10%
natural or known.

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, you guys,
what are you up to?

00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> They're showing me some
basically objects falling from

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:02.370 align:middle line:90%
the sky to the ocean.

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:07.830 align:middle line:10%
They found some correlating data
with the radiation detection.

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:10.720 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, honestly, it reminds
me of the stuff we were seeing

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:11.520 align:middle line:10%
in '04.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:14.220 align:middle line:10%
Tic Tacs.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.180 align:middle line:10%
They may be Tic Tacs.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:15.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe.

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:16.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Caught on our cameras.

00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:17.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.110 align:middle line:10%
>> That's incredible.

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:21.135 align:middle line:10%
>> And the fadeout makes it look
like it is really something--

00:59:21.135 --> 00:59:22.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:25.590 align:middle line:10%
>> --dropping from the sky
based on the way it fades out.

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:26.590 align:middle line:10%
>> That's great.

00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:27.390 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.070 align:middle line:10%
We got a lot of stuff actually.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.115 align:middle line:10%
>> Honestly, I'm very surprised
by everything that we've got.

00:59:32.115 --> 00:59:35.530 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, David, yesterday we
were doing all the night vision

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.330 align:middle line:10%
stuff.

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We just continuously
broadcast this over ultraviolet

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.260 align:middle line:84%
spectrum and wide spectrum
and infrared spectrum.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's say we provoked it.

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.045 align:middle line:90%
>> We provoked it.

as the raining Tic Tacs that

Our measurements of

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.960 align:middle line:10%

by the Scientific
Coalition of UAP Studies

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:14.520 align:middle line:10%
as well as Dr. Knuth's
scientific paper Entropy.

These in-depth scientific
analysis of the Navy Tic Tacs

detail similar estimated
size and velocities

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:26.130 align:middle line:10%
in the tens of thousands
of miles per hour,

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
just like the objects we have
captured on our FLIR cameras.

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:33.600 align:middle line:10%
We are getting more
validation from

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.580 align:middle line:10%
other legitimate organizations
about potential UAP properties,

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.450 align:middle line:10%
which is exactly what
is needed for this level

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:43.810 align:middle line:10%
of rigorous research.

01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:46.358 align:middle line:90%


01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So what kind of category
do we think these things are?

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Are they physical objects,
natural phenomena?

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Are they mental manifestations?

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Are we all imagining
seeing these things?

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I doubt that because we measure
it with scientific instruments.

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We're not all being hacked
and spoofed on this.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So my thoughts are
it is from some sort

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
of intelligent creation and
intelligent construction.

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, it's a
technological device.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:13.263 align:middle line:90%
It could be organic.

01:01:13.263 --> 01:01:14.430 align:middle line:90%
It could be electromagnetic.

01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:15.675 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows what?

01:01:15.675 --> 01:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> On this hand, it's ours.

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:20.610 align:middle line:90%
And on this hand, it's not ours.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And the answer lies
somewhere in between.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.080 align:middle line:90%
So my mind right now is open.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
If it turns out to be our stuff
or some other country stuff,

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:29.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm good with that.

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:31.210 align:middle line:90%
I have my answer.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
If it turns out to be
something not from this planet,

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm good with that too.

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:36.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, I have my answer now.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That stuff, knowledge,
information, engineering,

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that right now, to my knowledge,
nobody on this planet knows how

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.760 align:middle line:90%
to do.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:46.675 --> 01:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So that suggests that it's
somebody from some other place

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.942 align:middle line:84%
has done this or
maybe other time.

01:01:53.942 --> 01:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that's
an important point.

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:58.438 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned earlier
the multiple cases.

01:01:58.438 --> 01:01:59.730 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned the Bethune case.

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:01.230 align:middle line:90%
That's from 1951.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:03.480 align:middle line:10%
And you've got
these objects moving

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.640 align:middle line:10%
at very high accelerations
and taking off at high speeds.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
The pilot estimated
it as leaving

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
at about 1,500 miles
an hour, and it

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
was tracked on radar
from Newfoundland

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.180 align:middle line:90%
at 1,800 miles an hour.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.690 align:middle line:84%
This is two years
before the air speed

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
record of 695 miles
an hour was broken.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So this thing was moving
three or four times

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
faster than the
air speed record.

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
There are also now declassified
reports, thanks to FOIA,

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.677 align:middle line:84%
mentioning flying
white butane tanks.

01:02:31.677 --> 01:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like a lot
like a Tic Tac to me.

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:35.135 align:middle line:10%
And that was the late
'40s, early '50s.

01:02:35.135 --> 01:02:36.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Let me put this
in perspective.

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:41.430 align:middle line:10%
Einstein, Rosen,
and Podolsky came up

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.580 align:middle line:10%
with these concepts
in the 1905 time frame

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.800 align:middle line:10%
into later about 1913.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So in about 100 years
is all that humanity

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
has had a basic
construct to say faster

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
than light travel, wormholes,
warp drives are even possible?

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:05.490 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't until 1994 that
someone was clever enough,

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:10.080 align:middle line:10%
Alcubierre came up with the warp
physics that says, OK, well,

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.185 align:middle line:10%
the physics we've learned since
1905 tells us, OK, maybe it

01:03:13.185 --> 01:03:15.060 align:middle line:10%
is possible to do what
they do in "Star Trek"

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.852 align:middle line:10%
and other science
fiction movies and books.

01:03:16.852 --> 01:03:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But that's only
100 to 120 years.

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Not thousands, not millions--

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The universe is
13.7 billion years old.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a civilization
somewhere near us

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.260 align:middle line:90%
that's thousands of years old.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Their Einstein was 10,000
years ago, for example.

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.225 align:middle line:90%
So where does that put them now?

01:03:33.225 --> 01:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> What if you have multiple
civilizations and they have

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:37.200 align:middle line:90%
different technologies?

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:37.632 align:middle line:90%
And they use different--

01:03:37.632 --> 01:03:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, they do.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>> --things.

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing that happens
is space gets compressed

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:42.840 align:middle line:90%
because the distance is shorter.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.130 align:middle line:90%
The space isn't empty.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
You've got about one hydrogen
atom per cubic meter.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So as you compress space
at very high speeds,

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer flying
through a vacuum.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
You're flying through a cloud
at close to the speed of light.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's going to rip your
ship apart in no time,

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
unless you have
a technology that

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.100 align:middle line:84%
allows you to travel through
matter without affecting it,

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.960 align:middle line:84%
like, we actually
see here with--

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That is an excellent point.

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:07.680 align:middle line:10%
>> --crafts moving through
the air without sonic booms

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.390 align:middle line:10%
or moving through
water without splashes.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.930 align:middle line:90%
We observe--

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:12.013 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the other counter
that's always giving--

01:04:12.013 --> 01:04:13.656 align:middle line:90%
>> That's data.

01:04:13.656 --> 01:04:15.260 align:middle line:10%
>> We made it, guys.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.065 align:middle line:10%
We got a lot of great data.

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:18.440 align:middle line:10%
And I just wanted
to let you guys

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.850 align:middle line:10%
know I'm very proud of the way
that you guys have performed

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:24.960 align:middle line:10%
above and beyond
any expectations

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.080 align:middle line:10%
I could have ever had.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
We got some great
results, and let's start

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.990 align:middle line:90%
getting ready for the next one.

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:35.280 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%


01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The past five days have been
very hard and very exciting.

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
We managed to capture multiple
anomalies in multiple locations

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
across multiple
devices in real time.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a first in
the field of ufology.

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:58.640 align:middle line:10%
What are the odds that we would
capture the exact Navy Tic

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Tacs that these guys saw
over their ship in 2004?

01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:05.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's up to the
scientists to continue

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:08.210 align:middle line:10%
analyzing the data
over the next few weeks

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:12.080 align:middle line:10%
and tell us more about the
properties of these objects

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.255 align:middle line:10%
and what this phenomenon
is really about.

01:05:15.255 --> 01:05:32.805 align:middle line:90%


01:05:32.805 --> 01:05:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, you guys.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.130 align:middle line:90%
We've made it.

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, glad you're here.

01:05:37.187 --> 01:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to need
to sit down for this

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
because it's pretty
mind blowing.

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So grab a seat.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.730 align:middle line:90%
We want anomalies.

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Is this very different?

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and the story starts
with the list of anomalous

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:50.150 align:middle line:90%
events in the cosmic watch.

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:53.480 align:middle line:10%
So I made a list
of all events that

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.330 align:middle line:10%
were either high in energy,
high in rate or both.

01:05:57.330 --> 01:06:03.890 align:middle line:10%
So the highest energy we
recorded in the cosmic watch

01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:08.720 align:middle line:10%
was 43.37 megaelectron
volts, MeV.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the highest we
recorded the entire week.

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:14.720 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of the maximum
for terrestrial radiation.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.470 align:middle line:90%
2 MeV is more average.

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> That high energy event I
just mentioned was at 4:01 AM.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
At 3:59 AM, this is what
the UFODAP recorded.

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a hole in
the clouds, which

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is not abnormal to have a hole
in the clouds that closes.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:35.720 align:middle line:84%
But notice those
strange dots within it.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you
go frame by frame,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.190 align:middle line:84%
it closes in a
fraction of a second.

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:44.345 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be too fast
for natural cloud formations.

01:06:44.345 --> 01:06:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>> For clouds to move
in and close the hole,

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:49.130 align:middle line:10%
they would have had to be
going something like 700 miles

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.650 align:middle line:10%
an hour.

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> How far away was it?

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:52.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I can show
you a diagram I've made

01:06:52.362 --> 01:06:53.780 align:middle line:90%
of the situation.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's
basic trigonometry.

01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
We're using the known angles.

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So we know which direction
the camera's aiming.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
We know the field of
view of the camera.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:07.170 align:middle line:10%
And that hole was about 18
degrees above the horizon.

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:10.400 align:middle line:10%
And so given a cloud
ceiling of about 1,700 feet,

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:15.030 align:middle line:10%
you can say that hole was about
1.2 kilometers off the coast.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.090 align:middle line:10%
And so it's an elliptical hole.

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:20.570 align:middle line:10%
It's about 0.4
kilometers long and then

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.850 align:middle line:10%
about 0.1 kilometers wide.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's a
hole in the clouds,

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.230 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
fallstreak cloud.

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Those typically happen when
you have very high altitude

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
clouds and a section of the
cloud that then spontaneously

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
freezes, and then
the crystals fall out

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.130 align:middle line:90%
and leaves a hole in the cloud.

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:43.850 align:middle line:84%
That isn't possible in this case
because the cloud ceiling was

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
only 1,700 feet, and
it wasn't cold enough

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.290 align:middle line:90%
for it to be that kind of cloud.

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:50.600 align:middle line:84%
A hole like that could
also be explained

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
from an airplane
or another aircraft

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
flying through the clouds
that can cause a hole as well.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any aircraft
going through at the time.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO depth cameras
didn't pick up any craft.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cameras
did start recording

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.530 align:middle line:90%
because they detected something.

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, and Jeremy
slowed it down.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.042 align:middle line:10%
There's also a new
dot that appears

01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:13.250 align:middle line:10%
in the last couple of frames.

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.850 align:middle line:10%
The dots-- there are a
few dots appearing, yeah.

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, but there's one fresh--

01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:20.644 align:middle line:10%
there's one lonely dot,
fresh dot that appears.

01:08:20.644 --> 01:08:23.569 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you check the radiation
data with any outside

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:24.529 align:middle line:10%
organizations?

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the data from
Fermi, the NASA spacecraft that

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
looks at gamma ray bursts
from distant astrophysical

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.560 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%
There is no correlation there.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We did have to check
also for solar activity.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.835 align:middle line:10%
This event is not correlated
with the solar activity.

01:08:42.835 --> 01:08:45.352 align:middle line:90%
>> So what about the FLIR?

01:08:45.352 --> 01:08:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Anything with the FLIR.

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Unfortunately--

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --the FLIR about seven
minutes before this event took

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.859 align:middle line:84%
place, all eight FLIR
cameras shut down.

01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:55.939 align:middle line:90%
We lost power.

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:58.505 align:middle line:84%
And power was distributed
from two different sources.

01:08:58.505 --> 01:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think
it's a coincidence.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So this really
bothers me because it

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
reminds me of how the
phenomenon is often

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:09.020 align:middle line:84%
associated with
electromagnetic anomalies

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that cause things to
break, cars to turn off

01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:16.729 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, that I
think it's really "convenient"

01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:18.290 align:middle line:90%
that the FLIR went down.

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> How about the people
who would say, well,

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe there is something
malfunctioning with the camera?

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:25.700 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to that?

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We actually have several
minutes before the video we

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.720 align:middle line:90%
looked at.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
We have another video that
doesn't have the speckles

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.479 align:middle line:84%
but has the hole
several minutes before.

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But then even better, we
have the entire week's worth

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:42.439 align:middle line:84%
of UFODAP video
and imagery where

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:44.300 align:middle line:90%
it's functioning perfectly.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.740 align:middle line:90%
It's triggering on birds.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.270 align:middle line:90%
It's triggering on planes.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And it even has a built-in
classification system

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
where it says
percentage probability

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.540 align:middle line:90%
it's a plane or a bird.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, we also
have direct controls

01:09:57.350 --> 01:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
from a nearly identical part of
the sky, day and time, no hole,

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
just clouds.

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And the camera's functioning
perfectly normally.

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's just too many
strange coincidences here

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
with all the different
events stacked together.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
easy to take one video

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and say it's this or that
or it's not really anomalous

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.040 align:middle line:90%
because it can be anything.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But it can't be anything because
we've done these calculations,

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.110 align:middle line:90%
and we have these correlations.

01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's extremely
unlikely that it was

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:27.380 align:middle line:90%
a malfunction in the camera.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any correlative
data with weather radar

01:10:30.738 --> 01:10:31.655 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

01:10:31.655 --> 01:10:32.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:32.455 --> 01:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
We were able to
obtain weather radar.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Just before 4 o'clock, you
see a large clump of area

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
where you have a
lot of turbulence.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And so this is correlated with
the presence of that hole.

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
The radar shows that
there was actually

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.020 align:middle line:90%
reflective objects in the area.

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.230 align:middle line:10%
>> High energy particles and
gamma rays would have bombarded

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:55.420 align:middle line:10%
the entire CCD
chip on the camera,

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:58.760 align:middle line:10%
resulting in spots uniformly
spread across the image.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.060 align:middle line:84%
As a result, these really
appear to be physical objects

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
somehow appearing
or materializing

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.630 align:middle line:90%
in the hole in the clouds.

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:07.270 align:middle line:10%
The radar return suggests
that we are seeing the objects

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:09.670 align:middle line:10%
through the hole in the
clouds at a distance of about

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:11.140 align:middle line:10%
5 kilometers away.

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.130 align:middle line:10%
Thus the objects are most
likely about 35 to 50 feet

01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:19.390 align:middle line:10%
in size, which is the estimated
size of the Tic Tac objects

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:21.190 align:middle line:10%
in the 2004 Nimitz encounter.

01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:23.716 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

01:11:23.716 --> 01:11:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have something
anomalous in different devices

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
at the same time that reduces
the probability, this is why,

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
for example, I've never bought
in to the claims that the, oh,

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
the Nimitz encounter or that
was just the radar didn't work.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.980 align:middle line:10%
So then the pilot's eyes
were also deceiving them.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:48.120 align:middle line:10%
At the exact same time, the
radar wasn't working properly.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And the radar wasn't working
properly at the exact same time

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.950 align:middle line:90%
the FLIR cameras wasn't.

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:middle line:10%
It's just so absurd to
claim that multiple devices

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.540 align:middle line:10%
and multiple different
imaging modalities were

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.200 align:middle line:10%
all conveniently malfunctioning
at the same time,

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.210 align:middle line:10%
telling you the same thing?

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:07.725 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely insane.

01:12:07.725 --> 01:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with all
this, well, what is it?

01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of how it looks like
a hole that is open and then

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
closing, we called
it a wormhole,

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
which got me obviously
extremely excited.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
However, we have to be careful
because that would be obviously

here.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Our main problem is that
we assume they're just

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%
as primitive as we are.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They can digitize
their consciousness

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and put it on a laser beam
and shoot the laser beam

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.600 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.990 align:middle line:84%
What's at stake is our
understanding of reality

01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:54.100 align:middle line:90%
itself.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Our worldview could shatter
with one credible incident that

01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:02.060 align:middle line:90%
cannot be refuted.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The only explanation
that makes any sense is that

01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:07.930 align:middle line:84%
there's something of higher
intelligence that's got

01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:10.718 align:middle line:90%
advancement over our technology.

01:17:10.718 --> 01:17:12.760 align:middle line:10%
I think it's going to
change things in the world.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.340 align:middle line:10%
People are going to understand
there's something out

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:18.280 align:middle line:10%
there that isn't us.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
It isn't harming us, and
we can learn from it.

01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:25.370 align:middle line:90%
This is a paradigm shift.

01:17:28.685 --> 01:17:29.510 align:middle line:90%

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:31.475 align:middle line:84%

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I've shown you
some things before

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
that we found that were
very, very interesting.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.300 align:middle line:90%

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:18:11.606 --> 01:18:13.217 align:middle line:90%

>> Everyone.

01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, our scientists
have taken all the data

01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
for eight weeks nonstop, looking
into what could this possibly

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:43.510 align:middle line:90%
be.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:45.450 align:middle line:90%
This is radiation emission.

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And look at that.

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And there is a--

01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:48.910 align:middle line:90%

>> Exactly of 43.37.

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
That happens exactly
at the same time

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.880 align:middle line:90%
as that opening and closing.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Then it correlates with radar.

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.620 align:middle line:84%
They saw this
cluster that happens

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:12.915 align:middle line:84%
to be exactly in the
location of that anomaly.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:13.715 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:16.335 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a spike
in the radiation.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got a figure.

01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying
is that it's amorphous.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:22.830 align:middle line:90%
It opens and closes.

01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:24.100 align:middle line:90%
It contracts.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's nothing like
we know, nothing

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.255 align:middle line:90%
that is human knowledge.

01:19:28.255 --> 01:19:29.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:19:29.055 --> 01:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%

could be a wormhole,

some sort of gateway,
some sort of--

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What about it's
expanding and contracting?

01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, wormhole is
a separation in time.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that you can go
through this separation.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You can go into
another time zone.

01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> That is what the
scientists are investigating.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.830 align:middle line:10%

explored before in this way

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.383 align:middle line:10%

measured in this way.

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:05.550 align:middle line:90%

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%

you've gone to all this time

01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%

that we don't know anything

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.240 align:middle line:90%
about, trying to measure it.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.980 align:middle line:90%

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:33.405 align:middle line:84%
>> And probably don't really
want to be associated with

01:23:33.405 --> 01:23:34.205 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of morons.

01:23:34.205 --> 01:23:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> They're definitely on some
science that we're not at yet.

01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if anything,
we've taken from them.

01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They might be ahead
of us or behind us.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.400 align:middle line:90%
We never know.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably they
have the iPhone 21.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.960 align:middle line:10%
They're just waiting
till the right time

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.580 align:middle line:10%
to give that
information to Apple.

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:54.290 align:middle line:10%
>> If hypothetically a
spaceship would land right now

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:57.140 align:middle line:10%
and an extraterrestrial
will say, hey, Bill,

01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.410 align:middle line:10%
come on board with me.

01:23:58.410 --> 01:23:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I would love to.

01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I would embrace that
and say, come in peace.

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.480 align:middle line:90%
We live in peace.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
We want knowledge, and
I'd go into the spaceship

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.290 align:middle line:90%
and let them give me a baby.

01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Aw.

01:24:10.730 --> 01:24:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:16.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The next time you are
kidnapped by an alien

01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:19.550 align:middle line:10%
civilization, for God's
sake, steal something,

01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:23.630 align:middle line:10%
an alien hammer, an alien
pencil, an alien paperweight.

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:26.660 align:middle line:10%
There's no law against stealing
from an extraterrestrial

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:27.560 align:middle line:10%
civilization.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.540 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to
go to jail, and you'll

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:32.600 align:middle line:10%
have proof, living
proof that you've

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.205 align:middle line:10%
been in that flying saucer.

01:24:34.205 --> 01:24:37.520 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's extraordinary
that you've spent your time

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.870 align:middle line:10%
and your money doing that.

01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:43.520 align:middle line:10%
If we could explain something
that humans don't understand

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.960 align:middle line:10%
and we have a valid certified
explanation of something that

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.230 align:middle line:10%
has been a mystery and
no longer is a mystery,

01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:56.150 align:middle line:10%
that only adds to this
textbook of knowledge

01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:59.930 align:middle line:10%
that human beings are
striving every day to fill.

01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you can fill that
with one sentence, let alone

01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:06.200 align:middle line:90%
a chapter, it would be wondrous.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I am filled
with joy that you're

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:16.610 align:middle line:84%
making these forays out into
the stuff we see and don't see

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and trying to find
an explanation.

01:25:18.710 --> 01:25:21.635 align:middle line:84%
That's wonderful,
and I wish you well.

01:25:21.635 --> 01:25:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:44.000 align:middle line:90%
