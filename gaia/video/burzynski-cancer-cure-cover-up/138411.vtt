00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It is very difficult for
some reason to obtain permission

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.380 align:middle line:84%
to treat patients in
the United States.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
I think this country has the
finest bureaucratic regulations

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:10%
in the world, and the other
countries are way behind.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Here, the patient has to
go through very difficult

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
bureaucratic process, which
usually, most of the patients

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:84%
will not be able to go
through because they

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:90%
die during the process.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, they don't
want to have cure of cancer.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.292 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is
Sergeant Rick Schiff.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm an 11-year veteran of
the San Francisco Police

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:10%
Department.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:10%
I hold the department's highest
Medal of Honor for Bravery.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:10%
That used to mean a lot
more to me than it does now.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to talk
to you about today

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:84%
is my now
seven-year-old daughter.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:10%
This is an identical twin.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.084 align:middle line:10%
Her sister is now dead.

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
Her sister, when she
was four years old,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:10%
Kristen, developed a highly
malignant brain tumor

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
that had spread throughout
her spine and her brain.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:10%
The doctors told us that
we had really two options--

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:10%
take her home and let
her die, or bring her

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.547 align:middle line:10%
in for massive dosages of chemo
and radiation simultaneously.

00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:10%
In either event, she
was going to die.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:10%
They were quite certain
of that, and very quickly.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Believing her only chance
to be the standard route,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:10%
we gave her the
chemo and radiation.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:10%
It burned her skull so bad
she had second degree burns,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.586 align:middle line:10%
and her hair never came back.

00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:10%
To change her diapers, we
had to wear rubber gloves

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:10%
because her urine was so
toxic, and it burned her.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:10%
At the end of six
months, miraculously,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:10%
she survived the
standard treatment,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:10%
although there was a high
expectation she wouldn't.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:10%
She still had cancer.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:10%
We were told, sorry, we've
done everything we can.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:10%
Now she's going to die, probably
within a couple of months.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:10%
My wife and I, choosing not to
accept that, started reading.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:10%
The first book I picked
up, the third chapter,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:10%
discussed Dr. Burzynski.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.921 align:middle line:10%
As you may guess, I have
some expertise in fraud.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I'm quite
certain there are

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:10%
enough attorneys in the room
that could be voir dired

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:10%
as an expert in fraud.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:10%
And I conducted my
own investigation.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:10%
I've no doubt the
man is not a fraud.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:10%
I have no doubt
that he does what

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.474 align:middle line:10%
he does out of earnest belief
that his medicine works.

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:10%
And now you're in a position
to judge for yourselves

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:10%
whether it works or not.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:10%
But it's well-established by
the FDA that it's nontoxic.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:10%
18 months later,
we took my daughter

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:10%
off the antineoplaston.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:10%
She had not died.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:10%
She had no signs of tumor.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:10%
She remained free for
18 months of cancer.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:10%
Within a month, the cancer
was widespread in her brain.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:10%
We put her back on
Burzynski's, by the way,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:10%
at the objections
of our doctors,

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:10%
for some reason felt
that it had failed her.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:10%
We put her back on.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:10%
Within nine weeks, the
tumor was completely gone.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:10%
She died last July of
neurological necrosis.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:10%
Her brain fell apart
from the radiation.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:10%
The autopsy showed that she
was completely cancer free.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:10%
Out of 52 cases of that disease
ever, no one died cancer free.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:10%
Just Krissy.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:10%
So she didn't die of
a terminal illness.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:10%
She died of my inability
to care for her properly,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:10%
and she died from bad advice.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:10%
She died because there's a
government institution that

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:10%
disseminates false information
and is not looking out

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.289 align:middle line:10%
for the welfare of the people.

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:10%
You know, ladies and gentlemen,
I swore an oath 11 years ago,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.288 align:middle line:10%
and I think most
of us in this room

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:41.187 align:middle line:10%
swore it at one time or another
to uphold the Constitution.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:10%
It says "life" right
in the beginning.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.746 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I first heard of Dr.
Burzynski back in the late

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:10%
1980s, when he was in a battle
with the Texas Medical Board

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:10%
and the FDA regarding his
innovative approach to cancer.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't surprised by that.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:10%
Anyone who's
innovative in medicine

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:10%
creates waves in
the medical system.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:10%
However, in his case,
I was continually

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:10%
surprised that they didn't
put him out of business.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:10%
I kept hearing about him.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:10%
So in the mid-1990s,
I said Dr. Burzynski,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:10%
I want to come down
to visit your clinic

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:10%
and find out what you're doing.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:10%
It's very new to me.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:10%
When I arrived, he had seven
charts ready for me to review

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:10%
that had been reviewed by the
National Cancer Institute, who

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.667 align:middle line:10%
also made site visits
the year before.

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:10%
The National Cancer
Institute reported

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:10%
that these seven patients were
either in complete remission,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:10%
or there was
substantial improvement.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:10%
I was astounded.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski had MRIs
of brain tumor none

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:10%
to be universally fatal
that had simply disappeared.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
A Polish native named
Stanislaw Burzynski attended

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Lublin Medical University,
where he graduated first

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
in his class at age
24, and then received

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
his PhD in biochemistry
the following year.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
While undergoing his
research to acquire his PhD,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski made a
profound discovery.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
He found a strain of peptides
in human blood and urine

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
that had never
before been recorded

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:90%
in biomedical research.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
As his curiosity in
these peptides evolved,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
he made another
profound observation.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:10%
People who were
inflicted with cancer

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:10%
seemed to lack these
newly discovered peptides

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:10%
in both their blood
and urine, while those

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:10%
who were healthy
and free of cancer

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:10%
appeared to have an
abundance of these peptides.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski theorized that if
he could somehow provide a way

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:10%
to chemically extract these
peptides from the blood

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:10%
and urine of healthy
donors and administer

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:10%
these peptides to
those with cancer,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:10%
perhaps it could be useful
in treating the disease.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I started, I asked
the lawyers for the advice.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.550 align:middle line:10%
Can I use experimental
treatment,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:10%
which was the treatment
with antineoplastons.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:10%
Can I use this in
my private practice?

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:10%
And can I be involved
in cancer research,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:10%
simple as a private company?

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Burzynski's attorneys
investigated both state

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:10%
and federal law to find out if
it was legal for him to start

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:10%
his own biomedical research
company making Antineoplastons

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:10%
and administering them to his
patients within his private

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:10%
practice.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:10%
They found that according
to both the Texas

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:10%
State and federal law, the
use of any drug or new drug

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:10%
can be used to meet the
immediate needs of the patients

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:10%
of a licensed
doctor, particularly

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:10%
when there is no other
available option for them.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:10%
The law stated that
such activity was not

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:10%
governed at the time by the
Texas Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:10%
Act, and is not otherwise
unlawful under the laws

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:10%
of the state of Texas.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:10%
However, Dr. Burzynski
would not be legally allowed

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:10%
to introduce or
deliver Antineoplastons

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:10%
into interstate
commerce, which means

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:10%
he had to keep his activities
only within the state of Texas

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:10%
to avoid breaking
any federal laws.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:10%
As long as he did
this, his actions

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:10%
were not within the regulatory
authority of the FDA.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
However, once word began to
spread that Dr. Burzynski was

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
successfully treating
what was once considered

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
terminal incurable
cancer patients,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
people began traveling
from all over the country

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to receive
antineoplaston treatment.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:10%
>> We're talking with
Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:10%
who is an M.D. and a PhD has
done an experimental work

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:10%
in the area of cancer, and
has come up with some very

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:10%
interesting studies, which have
been backed up by about four

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:10%
and a half years
of investigation.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:10%
We've had two
patients who appear

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.481 align:middle line:10%
to be in differing
states of remission.

00:08:03.481 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, we started to
talk a little bit

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:10%
about the medical community's
acceptance of all this.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:10%
How is your research funded?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Initially, my research was
funded from National Cancer

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:10%
Institute and from Baylor
College of Medicine.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:10%
After I decided to
open my laboratory,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:10%
the only funds available for new
loans from the banks, patients

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:10%
fees, and payments from
the insurance companies.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Could you stand for
just a minute, Dr. Gardner.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.065 align:middle line:10%
This is Dr. Harold Gardner.

00:08:33.065 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, is there
anything about this

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:10%
that you find controversial?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:10%
I mean, his treatment.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:10%
Does it have a good scientific
background, hypothesis,

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:10%
and really controlled
studies behind it?

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, as the science of
investigation goes, Dr.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski's studies have
been quite professional,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:10%
certainly as creditable
as most at Wayne State

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:10%
and the University of Michigan
and others which I'm tied

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:10%
to directly.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:10%
The controversy is less in his
approach on a therapy basis

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:10%
than it is his approach
organizationally.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And much of the medical
and hospital industry

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:10%
operates as a very
closed shop, and if you

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:10%
have ideas that might
in one way or another

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:10%
jeopardize that economic
base, that you fall

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:10%
into disfavor very quickly.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:10%
>> That is an incredible
statement that you've just

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.530 align:middle line:10%
made.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And I've been involved
with several patients who have

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.060 align:middle line:10%
chosen options in
Europe and in Canada.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:10%
And those options are not
available in this country

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:10%
because of economic and
organizational reasons,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:10%
not because of
scientific reasons.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.334 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:48.334 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> For a long time, I didn't
have any contact with Texas

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Board of Medical Examiners,
until around 1984,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
some of my patients told me
that they were approached

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
by the agents sent to them
from Texas Board of Medical

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Examiners who were trying
to convince them to file

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:90%
complaints against me.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:90%
So this was shocking to me.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:10%
And what is surprising is that
they are using the state money,

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:10%
the taxpayers' money, to
travel a long distance,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.821 align:middle line:10%
like from Houston to California,
to convince our patients

00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:10%
to go to California to
file complaints against me.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:90%
This was completely irrational.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:10%
But nothing else
happened at that time,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:10%
until I met, by coincidence, the
vice president of MD Anderson

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:10%
Cancer Center,
Dr. Hickey, that I

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:10%
would have a problem this time
with Texas Board of Medical

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:10%
Examiners.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And obviously, the
problems began.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:10%
And I was called to Teas
Board of Medical Examiners.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:10%
They began investigating me.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:10%
However, there were no
complaints from the patients.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:10%
The patients were happy.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.086 align:middle line:10%
We were taking patients who
were very advanced, for whom

00:10:57.086 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:10%
there was nothing available, and
they were getting good results.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:10%
So apparently, there was no
justification for such action.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:10%
This was a very
unpleasant investigation.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:10%
They were trying to convince
me again to stop my research,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:10%
to stop treating patients.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
After about two years
of going back and forth

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and being called to
the board, finally they

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
proposed to me that I
should present to them

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
a number of cases of patients
who benefited from my practice.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And they informed me that
such medical records would

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
be a reviewed by
expert oncologist,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and if they are satisfied that
I am not harming patients,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
that the patients are
benefiting from my activity,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
then they would
leave me in peace.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:90%
I was very happy with this.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I believed that
Texas Board will do

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:84%
objective review of our
result, and finally, they

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:84%
will leave me alone,
because it has

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
amazing results in the treating
of very difficult cancer cases.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I supplied to them twice
as many medical records,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
which showed without any doubt
great results in the cancer

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:90%
treatment.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Incurable forms of cancer
completely disappearing,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.661 align:middle line:84%
with patients going
into complete remission.

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:84%
The patients who
were cured, they're

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
living normal life after that.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> After submitting these
cases to the medical board,

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
he didn't hear back from them,
leaving him to assume that

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
the board was satisfied and
would leave him in peace.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:10%
However, two years
later, the board

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.780 align:middle line:10%
came back again pretended
that the cases he submitted

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:10%
were not successful,
and claimed he

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:10%
was violating a law
that didn't exist,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:10%
which was grounds for the board
to cancel, revoke, or suspend

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.341 align:middle line:10%
his license.

00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a shock to me.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I believed in justice.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe in high
ethics of the board.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:90%
But this was just a lie.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:10%
>> The medical board had
no case against Burzynski,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:10%
which prompted the board to file
their first amended complaint

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:10%
in 1990.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:10%
Still, the board
had no case, which

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:10%
prompted them to file a second
amended complaint in 1992.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:10%
After about five years of this,
60 of Dr. Burzynski's patients

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:10%
petitioned the board to
stop harassing their doctor.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:10%
The board then tried to ignore
these petitions by attempting

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:10%
to strike them from the record.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:10%
Finally, in May of 1993,
this case went to trial.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I had never heard
of Dr. Burzynski.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know
anything about him.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:10%
I never was quite clear what
the board's problem was.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:10%
The board did not bring
any expert witnesses

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:10%
to contest points that were
raised by Dr. Burzynski.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:10%
Now without an expert
witness to render

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:10%
an opinion in certain areas,
I can't give any credence

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:10%
to opinion raised by a laymen.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:10%
And Dr. Burzynski brought
in Dr. Nicholas Patronas.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of the most
dramatic testimony on Dr.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski's behalf came
from Dr. Nicholas Patronas,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:10%
a Georgetown University expert
who is a member of the National

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:10%
Cancer Institute team
that analyzed seven of Dr.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski's cases.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The basic conclusion was that
in five of the patients with

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:10%
brain tumors that were fairly
large, the tumor resolved,

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:10%
disappeared.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they
are leaving, it's

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:90%
impressive and unbelievable.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>> He was quite a witness.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:10%
He said he had
never seen anything

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:10%
like what Dr. Burzynski
was able to accomplish

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:10%
with his antineoplastons
in brain cancer.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:10%
He had one young boy there
who had been treating.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:10%
He was about 12 at the hearing.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:10%
Strapping lad, a good-sized boy.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.404 align:middle line:10%
But when he was first
started on treatment

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:10%
when he was about
four years old--

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:10%
I think his name was Paul--

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:10%
he was given up on by
his original doctor.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When Mary Michaels took
the stand on behalf of her son

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.977 align:middle line:84%
Paul, she trained her eyes
on the state's attorney.

00:15:00.977 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I have enough to
worry about when I go to bed

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.037 align:middle line:84%
at night, about my
son and my family.

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to worry
that this treatment is

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.583 align:middle line:90%
going to be taken away.

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you think
might happen if--

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.644 align:middle line:10%


00:15:16.644 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:10%
never mind.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.785 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

00:15:20.785 --> 00:15:24.294 align:middle line:90%
I have no other questions.

00:15:24.294 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> For all I know, the
kid may still be alive.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> The tumors will grow.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
They will lose their vision.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
They will be paralyzed,
and they will

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:84%
die, because there's nothing
in the world which can be used

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:90%
to save these patients' lives.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You intend to continue doing
just what you've been doing

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
until somebody is
able to stop you.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that not true?

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to do what the
law will allow me to do, Mr.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
[? Holcomb. ?] I do whatever is
necessary to bring my medicines

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to approval in the United States
and everywhere in the world,

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and bring you to justice for
causing the deaths of 200

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:90%
patients.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And they will come back here to
haunt you until you are dead.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you threatening
me, Dr. Burzynski?

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:07.973 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not threatening you.

00:16:07.973 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But that's what's going
to happen in the future.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that's
something that remains to be

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.322 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:16:14.322 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> They weren't
real happy with me.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I could tell that from the
way they were talking to me

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:90%
and asking questions.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Then they told me
after, they were

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
going to rewrite my
proposal for a decision

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and take adverse action
against Dr. Burzynski.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I thought
that was rather foolish.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The state of Texas
wants Houston doctor,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Stanislaw Burzynski, to stop
treating his patients with

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:84%
drugs he produces at his
own pharmaceutical plant.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
The drugs called Antineoplastons
are nontoxic compounds

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of proteins and
amino acids, often

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
lacking in cancer patients.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Even though the state
of Texas acknowledges

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that the drugs may be helping
some who are terminally ill,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
the state says the
drugs shouldn't be used.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the State Board of
Medical Examiners, which

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:90%
licenses doctors in Texas.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the agency challenging
Dr. Burzynski in court.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.390 align:middle line:84%
One judge has already
told the board members

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
that they don't have a case.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> All of this nonsense with
them now should disappear,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
because they should realize
that I am right, OK?

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:10%
They are fighting losing battle.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I am saving human lives, and
if they put me out of business,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:90%
then people will die.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the brain of an
8-year-old boy with a huge

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
tumor most thought
would kill him.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:90%
He used Dr. Burzynski's drug.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Images of his skull
taken six years later

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
show the tumor has
almost disappeared.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Bruce Cohen is the
Director of Neurologic Oncology

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.109 align:middle line:84%
at the prestigious
Cleveland Clinic.

00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The only explanation
is that it's shrunk

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
because of the therapy
Paul has received.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> He confirmed Dr.
Burzynski's results on Paul.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Seven years that we've had
Paul, and he's been healthy,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:90%
and I owe it to this man.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
way that I'd ever

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
be able to thank him enough
for what he's done for us.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, that boy Paul Michaels
and his anxious family sit

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
in the courtroom
with other patients.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Undeterred by
the 1993 ruling,

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
the Texas Medical Board took Dr.
Burzynski to a higher district

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:90%
court.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this
time they knew they

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
couldn't raise any issues
about whether or not

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
his treatment was effective.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The Texas State Board
of Medical Examiners,

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:84%
which has fought to suspend Dr.
Burzynski's license because his

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
treatments have never
been approved, says quote,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:84%
"the efficacy of antineoplastons
in the treatment of human

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
cancers is not of issue
in these proceedings.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes a bureaucrat
to come up with that idea,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:84%
because a layman, that would
really be the question.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Dr. Burzynski has
won his latest round in court.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.180 align:middle line:84%
The medical examiner's
order was reversed.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
But that is not expected to
be the end of his trouble

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:90%
with the state of Texas.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The Texas Medical Board
took this case all the way

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:84%
to the Texas State
Supreme Court,

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
leaving the Texas Medical
Board completely unsuccessful

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.270 align:middle line:84%
in their efforts to remove
his medical license.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So if efficacy was not an
issue, and Dr. Burzynski

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
wasn't breaking
any laws, then why

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
would the Texas Medical
Board continue on

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
with this empty pursuit?

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was
eventually realized,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:84%
even by the mainstream
press, that the Food and Drug

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Administration had been
pressuring the Texas Medical

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Board to continue trying to
take away Dr. Brzezinski's

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:90%
medical license.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> For this story, we wanted
to talk to the FDA about its

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:90%
policies and procedures.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The agency did agree to talk
to us on background where

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be quoted, but it
repeatedly refused our requests

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:90%
for on-camera interviews.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> While they were busy
pressuring the Texas State

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Medical Board to
try to revoke Dr.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski's medical license,
they were even busier trying

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to revoke Dr. Burzynski
completely from society

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
by trying to place
him in prison.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:10%
On March 12th, 1976, FDA Bureau
of Drugs Director Richard Crout

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.120 align:middle line:10%
states in the
cancer letter, "When

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:10%
anyone other than
large institutions

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:10%
ask permission to
conduct clinical trials,

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:10%
you want harsh regulations.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes we say it is
proper to hinder research.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And once these
guidelines were adopted,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the FDA would consider
itself bound by them."

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:10%
In 1982, Krout states
again, "I never

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:10%
have and never will approve
a new drug to an individual,

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:10%
but only to a large
pharmaceutical firm

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:10%
with unlimited finances."

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:10%
And so the fiercest fight
in FDA history began.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Burzynski's dealings
with the FDA commenced in 1983.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:10%
At that point, the FDA
commenced a civil action

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:10%
to try to close the clinic
and stop all patients

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:10%
from receiving the medicine.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Before the judge in this
case had announced her ruling,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:10%
the FDA sends her a letter
warning her in advance,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:10%
"if this court declines to
grant the injunction sought

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:10%
by the government, thus
permitting continued

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:10%
manufacture and distribution
of antineoplastons,

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.160 align:middle line:10%
the government would then be
obliged to pursue other less

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.060 align:middle line:10%
efficient remedies, such
as actions for seizure,

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:10%
also known as raiding
his clinic and home,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:10%
and condemnation of the drugs,"
also known as a propaganda

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:10%
campaign, "or criminal
prosecution of individuals,"

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:10%
also known as throwing
Dr. Burzynski in prison.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of these
threats from the FDA--

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The judge in the case
basically said that he can

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
treat anybody he wants in Texas,
but he can't ship his medicine

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:90%
in interstate commerce.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.900 align:middle line:84%
The FDA viewed that as a
failure and told Dr. Burzynski

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
at the time, his
attorneys at the time,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that they have other
ways to get him.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the other ways.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
In 1985, the FDA
convened a grand jury

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to hear evidence to try
to indict Dr. Burzynski.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
In connection with that, they
had a raid of his clinic,

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84%
where they seized
200,000 pieces of paper,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.255 align:middle line:84%
including all of his medical
records of all patients.

00:22:00.255 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:84%
A little difficult
to practice medicine

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
when you don't have
medical records.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, they came out,
and they confiscated all

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:90%
of our medical records.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:18.725 align:middle line:84%
And took us about
12 years or 14 years

00:22:18.725 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
to recover these
medical records.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
we are permitted

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to make copies of the medical
records in the office,

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:84%
but it was also the neglect
of human well-being.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:84%
We are treating
very sick people.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:90%
They took medical records.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And we needed these
medical records

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
to really fight for the
lives of these patients,

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:90%
but they took this away.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:84%
They didn't care
for these patients.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:90%
The patients could die.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.709 align:middle line:90%
They were not involved.

00:22:44.709 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> They presented the
evidence to the grand jury.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:90%
No indictment.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
1986, they come back and seize
another 100,000 documents.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:90%
No indictment.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I just have real trouble in
knowing how much pain and what

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:10%
people go through with cancer.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:10%
And since 1967,
you've been saying,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:10%
I can take care of that, and
people are going, forget it.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:10%
Don't pay any attention.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And you've gone outside the
country, and they say fine,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.630 align:middle line:10%
and here we say no?

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:09.843 align:middle line:10%
Are we that backward, Doctor?

00:23:09.843 --> 00:23:10.643 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:23:10.643 --> 00:23:11.836 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you mean, yes?

00:23:11.836 --> 00:23:13.234 align:middle line:10%
Are we that backward?

00:23:13.234 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:10%
It's really unfortunate
that there's

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:10%
a big gap between people's
pain and suffering,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:10%
and what the powers that
be are willing to accept

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:10%
to give to be able to treat.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:10%
It's difficult for doctors to
belay 10, 12 years of training

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:10%
and go against that, and
believe that some man,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:10%
some guy from Houston, has
come up with something.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Isn't part of your problem
that the treatment of cancer is

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.285 align:middle line:10%
a very profitable industry
for a lot of companies,

00:23:46.285 --> 00:23:49.760 align:middle line:10%
and that your treatment
right now will eat into those

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:10%
company's profits?

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Bingo.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.436 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:55.436 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.385 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that there
are the people who give

00:24:01.385 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:10%
the chemotherapy,
and people like that,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:10%
and the drug companies would
have a very good reason for not

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:10%
helping you out.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I would disagree with that,
from the standpoint that,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:10%
as Dr. Burzynski's
pointed out himself,

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:10%
the patients he's treating are
patients who are not currently

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:10%
eligible for chemotherapy
or radiation.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:10%
If we were to find a new
drug that had a high cure

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:10%
rate of cancer, it would
give us the opportunity

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:10%
to treat many patients in
whom we don't have potentially

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:10%
effective therapies now.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> 1990, another grand jury,
either the second or the third.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:90%
They present more documents.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski
testifies extensively

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:90%
before the grand jury.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:42.880 align:middle line:90%
No indictment.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:90%
1991 to 1993.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:90%
FDA investigates Dr. Burzynski.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if
evidence was presented

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:90%
to another grand jury.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:90%
1994.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Another grand jury.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:90%
No indictment.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:90%
1995.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Another grand jury.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
This grand jury started
in March of this year.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.940 align:middle line:10%
On March 25th, I believe,
it was Dr. Burzynski

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:10%
along with a few of his
patients appeared on CBS show,

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.857 align:middle line:10%
"This Morning."

00:25:07.857 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Let me play devil's advocate.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:10%
Here you all, very
desperate folk,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:10%
had undergone some cancer
treatment, correct?

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.090 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:16.456 align:middle line:10%
>> None?

00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:17.289 align:middle line:10%
None at all for you?

00:25:17.289 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I had no treatment.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Let me go ahead and
go after these guys.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:10%
They had undergone
some treatment.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:10%
Could it not have been that
the treatment that you received

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:10%
prior to Dr.
Burzynski's treatment

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:10%
was what, in fact,
really cured you?

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'll jump on that.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:10%
No way, because the
recurrence I had

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:10%
was in a brand new spot that
had not been involved before.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.387 align:middle line:10%
So if all the punishment that
I went through for the year

00:25:40.387 --> 00:25:42.220 align:middle line:10%
went out of my system,
and after it went out

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:10%
of my system, all of a
sudden, a new tumor comes in,

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:10%
how could that
first treatment have

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:10%
helped the subsequent tumor?

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Later that day, the
FDA came, another raid.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:90%
More patient documents.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:90%
More subpoenas.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:10%
>> We were flooded with calls
last Friday with people wanting

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.985 align:middle line:10%
to know how to
get a hold of you.

00:25:59.985 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:10%
They're going to see
this story, this morning

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:10%
see that you've been
raided by the FDA,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:10%
and they're going to want
to know if you are for real,

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:10%
or if the concerns of the
FDA may have something

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:10%
to do with your treatments
and the viability

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.826 align:middle line:10%
of your treatments.

00:26:15.826 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I don't think--
let me jump in here.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:10%
I don't think there's
really an issue,

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:10%
as I mentioned, regarding
the safety of the drug.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:10%
And the FDA isn't
contending at this point

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:10%
that the drug doesn't work.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:10%
The only issue is that
according to the FDA,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:10%
it has not been proven by
controlled clinical trials.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:10%
So at least in terms
of safety, the FDA

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:10%
isn't saying that it's not
safe, and the FDA isn't even

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:10%
saying that it doesn't work.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:10%
Right now, they're
just contesting--

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.110 align:middle line:10%
or apparently,
they're contesting

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:10%
whether Dr. Burzynski himself
has been shipping the medicine

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:10%
out of state, which
in some respects

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:10%
is quite ridiculous
since he has approval

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:10%
to ship the medicine
out of state

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:10%
to various cancer institutions
around the country.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:10%
He ships it out of the
country to various countries

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:10%
because it's being
used in other places,

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:10%
and he ships it
to individuals who

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:10%
have been granted
permission by the FDA

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:10%
to receive the medicine under
what's called a Compassionate

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:10%
Use IMDs.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> May, June, and July, more
witnesses testified before

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:90%
the grand jury, more documents.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So we've had now four,
five, or six grand juries.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk about the
subpoena practices.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Most recently, the FDA has now
subpoenaed the medical records

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of every patient
who has gone on TV

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and told their story
about Dr. Burzynski.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll let the committee judge
what they think of that.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
You talk about dissemination of
false information by the FDA.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:90%
1985, FDA tells anyone who--

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:84%
calls inquiring
about Dr. Burzynski

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that he's being
criminally investigated.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:84%
When the judge on the
case found out about that,

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
he issued a cease and desist
and a strong reprimand

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:90%
against that.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The FDA now has
refined this tactic.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Instead of waiting for
people to call up the FDA,

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
what they've done is
subpoena all the records

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:84%
from Dr. Burzynski about
his business associates

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and all the researchers
around the world--

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.106 align:middle line:84%
and there are many of
them who are researching

00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:90%
antineoplastons, his therapy.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Now what they're doing
is systematically

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
contacting everyone
who does business

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:84%
with him, who may do
business with him,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.826 align:middle line:84%
and telling about the
grand jury investigation

00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:21.200 align:middle line:90%
subpoenaing documents.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they're
doing this in order

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
to make it more difficult
for him to do business.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like the following questions
to be asked to the FDA.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
How much money have they
spent in the last 10 years

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to try to put Dr.
Burzynski out of business?

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:84%
How many documents
can they subpoena?

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And how many more grand
juries does he have to go to?

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And why can't patients
who have advanced cancer

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.780 align:middle line:84%
seek medical treatment
of their choice?

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Upon the commencement of the
FDA's 1995 grand jury against

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski, an oversight and
investigation subcommittee was

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:10%
organized by Congressman
Joe Barton in an attempt

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:10%
to intervene in the FDA's
relentless harassment of Dr.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.570 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski and his patients.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:10%
>> In my opinion, you have every
right to use the investigative

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.970 align:middle line:10%
authority and the judicial
resources of the federal

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:10%
government to the Justice
Department to convene a grand

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:10%
jury.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:10%
That's very appropriate,
the first time, perhaps even

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:10%
the second time.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:10%
It becomes questionable
the third time.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:10%
The fourth time and the
fifth time, it is not,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:10%
I think, an unlogical
conclusion to think

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:10%
that the FDA has a vendetta
against Dr. Burzynski,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.200 align:middle line:10%
or wants to retaliate
for some reason.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:10%
Now that's my opinion.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:10%
How many grand
jury investigations

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:10%
have to occur that result
in no finding of fault

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:10%
before you as
commissioner of the FDA

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:10%
would encourage those
within your organization

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:10%
to cease and desist?

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. Chairman, how do you
know that there were no findings

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:10%
of fault that were returned
from that grand jury?

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:10%
>> There have been no
indictments returned.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. Chairman, I've
asked counsel to comment,

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:10%
but I don't think
those are the same--

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:10%
as a matter of law, those
are the same things.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm baffled by the
splitting of hairs here.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just trying to
understand the exchange between

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:10%
the witness and the chairman.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:10%
>> What I understood the
chairman to say is that there

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.590 align:middle line:10%
have been four grand
juries convened?

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:10%
>> At least four.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I just am left, then, with
the rather strong inference

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:10%
that if you convene four
separate grand juries

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:10%
and there's no
indictment returned,

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:10%
notwithstanding the
prosecutors tell us always that

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:10%
it's possible to indict a
ham sandwich, that probably,

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.800 align:middle line:10%
there's not much there.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Dozens of Dr. Burzynski's
patients who had traveled

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
to Washington, DC from all
corners of the United States

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.995 align:middle line:84%
stood up and expressed
their outrage with the FDA

00:30:57.995 --> 00:30:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and Commissioner David Kessler.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The FDA has made a list and
decided who can live and who

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.060 align:middle line:90%
will die.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.970 align:middle line:90%
I guess I didn't make that list.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I've had no chemotherapy.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I've had no radiation I
chose Dr. Burzynski instead,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:84%
after a lot of research
and a lot of searching.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been in
remission since 1989.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kessler, I'm
not a statistic.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We're frustrated that our
rights, constitutional rights,

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:90%
have been violated.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:90%
This has got to end.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.887 align:middle line:84%
My children are
asking me, Daddy,

00:31:33.887 --> 00:31:34.970 align:middle line:90%
what does the future hold?

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:10%
My one daughter wrote a
letter to the president

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:10%
of this country and said,
please don't pull the plug

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:10%
on my daddy.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And that just broke my heart
and broke my wife's heart.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> My husband is
a walking miracle.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:84%
16 months ago, the
doctors told us there's

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.630 align:middle line:84%
nothing else they
can do, and he told

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.650 align:middle line:84%
us to enjoy what little
life he has left.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Look at him.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:10%
He biked 32 miles after being
on Dr. Burzynski's treatment

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.410 align:middle line:10%
for two months, and they're
saying we can't have it?

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a report from
my family physician,

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.040 align:middle line:90%
which tells how well I am doing.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
My tumors are leaving my
body, and my condition

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.880 align:middle line:90%
is improving every day.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Now the FDA is saying to me,
no, your doctor is a criminal?

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
He should be put in jail and
he needs to be shut down?

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.580 align:middle line:90%
This is criminal.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I want the FDA to get out
of our lives and stay out

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
of our doctor-patient
relationship.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What the classical
conventional medicine had to do

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:45.080 align:middle line:90%
for me was there nothing.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.530 align:middle line:84%
For me, the next thing
was the minister.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I did not want to
undergo chemotherapy,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:84%
which I had a new
name for, kill him

00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
therapy, or any
type of radiation.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I was extremely lucky
I found Dr. Burzynski.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want the FDA
to take this right from me.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I came 18 years ago
from communist Romania,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and the tyrannous
dictator Ceausescu never

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:24.860 align:middle line:84%
stopped a doctor from
treating anybody.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:84%
How can we have something like
this in the United States?

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Barely a week after these
hearings, on November 20th,

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:84%
1995, Dr. Stanislaw
Burzynski was indicted.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski was charged with 75
counts of violating federal law

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and fraud.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.050 align:middle line:84%
If convicted,
Burzynski would face

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:84%
a maximum of 290 years in
a federal prison and $18

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 million in fines,
not to mention what

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:90%
would happen to his patients.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> He is their last
chance for life,

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:84%
but now the federal government
is issuing a death sentence

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.980 align:middle line:84%
for the patients of
this cancer doctor.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> On February 9, Houston court
judge, Sim Lake, ruled Dr.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski's treatments
have been quote,

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:23.260 align:middle line:84%
"illegal under Texas and
federal law since 1984,"

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.679 align:middle line:84%
and he ordered them stopped on
all but a handful of patients.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Then he put a stay on his own
order, a stay of execution.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that most of these
300 people will die within

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.980 align:middle line:10%
a short period of time if
the treatment is stopped.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1996, not only
did scores of Dr.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.650 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski's patients
return to Washington,

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:10%
DC to protest his indictment,
but many of them testified

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:10%
again, before another
congressional hearing headed

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.330 align:middle line:10%
by Congressman Joe Barton.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.085 align:middle line:10%
>> Our first witness
is Mariann Kunnari.

00:34:56.085 --> 00:34:56.885 align:middle line:10%
Is that correct?

00:34:56.885 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, that's correct.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.330 align:middle line:10%
>> From Aurora, Minnesota.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.610 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Dustin
Kunnari, and he is on Dr.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.910 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski's
antineoplaston treatment.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:10%
This is my husband,
Jack Kunnari.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:10%
Now in February of 1994, our
lives were drastically changed.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:20.140 align:middle line:10%
My son Dustin was only two and
a half years old at the time.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.030 align:middle line:10%
He was diagnosed with a brain
tumor the size of a golf ball.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:10%
The surgeon removed 75% of his
tumor, and the remaining 25%

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:10%
was diagnosed from a
biopsy as a malignant, very

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:10%
aggressive, medulloblastoma
brain tumor, one of the most

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:10%
deadly forms of brain cancer.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.790 align:middle line:10%
The doctors told us Dustin
had only a few months to live.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:10%
The first treatment offered
to us was radiation,

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:10%
but the radiation doctor
told us at his young age,

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.230 align:middle line:10%
Dustin would become a
vegetable, and it would only

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:10%
extend his life for
maybe a few months.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.690 align:middle line:10%
The next doctor
wanted us to enroll

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:13.750 align:middle line:10%
Dustin in an experimental
chemotherapy, which

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.180 align:middle line:10%
was highly toxic.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:25.000 align:middle line:10%
The side effects would include
hearing loss, kidney and liver

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.037 align:middle line:10%
damage, bladder, stunted
growth, and a possible leukemia.

00:36:31.037 --> 00:36:34.450 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:10%
One question I would
like to ask is, would you

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.702 align:middle line:10%
do that to your child?

00:36:37.702 --> 00:36:40.300 align:middle line:10%


00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:10%
We weighed the harm these
experimental drugs would cause

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.530 align:middle line:10%
against the fact that they
would not cure Dustin,

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:10%
and decided not to subject
him to these drastic measures.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:10%
But an oncologist told us that
their opinion took precedence

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:10%
over us as parents.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:10%
This put added stress to the
already stressful situation

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:10%
we were in.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:10%
In April of 1994, we visited
Doctor Stanislaw Burzynski

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:10%
in Houston.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski made
us no promises,

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:21.880 align:middle line:10%
but said that he often had very
good results with brain tumors.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.820 align:middle line:10%
At worst, it would
not hurt Dustin,

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:10%
and it offered the best hope
and a longer quality of life.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.440 align:middle line:10%
An MRI six weeks after we
started Doctor Burzynski's

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.825 align:middle line:10%
treatment revealed no tumor.

00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.130 align:middle line:10%
We were very overjoyed.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.220 align:middle line:10%
Dustin continued
antineoplaston therapy,

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:58.880 align:middle line:10%
and one year later, a tumor
1 inch by 1 inch in size

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.441 align:middle line:10%
was found on the MRI.

00:38:00.441 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:10%


00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:10%
That would be April of 1995.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski immediately
raised Dustin's dose

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.328 align:middle line:10%
of antineoplastons.

00:38:12.328 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.050 align:middle line:10%
There were still no harsh
side effects at all.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:10%
The next MRI in
September of 1995

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:10%
revealed that the tumor had
almost disappeared again.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:31.584 align:middle line:10%
To this day, it
has not reappeared.

00:38:31.584 --> 00:38:43.500 align:middle line:10%
If you look at Dustin
right now, [CRYING],

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:10%
he is a happy,
healthy four-year-old

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.130 align:middle line:10%
who has outlived his prognosis.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:10%
There is no
traditional treatment

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.571 align:middle line:10%
that would have kept him alive
with such good quality of life.

00:39:05.571 --> 00:39:08.150 align:middle line:10%


00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.790 align:middle line:10%
FDA commissioner
David Kessler loves

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:10%
to grab headlines as a
man who loves children

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:10%
so much he wants to protect them
from the ravages of smoking.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:10%
If Dr. Kessler loves
children so much,

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.930 align:middle line:10%
why have he and his agencies
been trying so hard to cut off

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.720 align:middle line:10%
my son's last hope for life.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.975 align:middle line:10%
Without this treatment,
my son will die.

00:39:32.975 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a photo of Dustin
Kunnari at four years old

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:10%
in 1996.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.660 align:middle line:10%
This is a photo of Dustin
Kunnari at 22 years

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:10%
old in 2013, happily
married, and this

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.020 align:middle line:10%
is a photo of Dustin
Kunnari today,

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.410 align:middle line:10%
paying it forward by helping
to save the lives of others

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.434 align:middle line:10%
as a firefighter and paramedic.

00:39:59.434 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:10%
>> American Cancer patients
from now on will have faster

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.840 align:middle line:10%
and easier access to
more promising therapies.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:10%
Here in a nutshell
is the importance

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:21.910 align:middle line:10%
of each of the president and
the FDA's four proposals.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:10%
First, for patients
with refractory,

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:10%
hard to treat cancer,
instead of requiring evidence

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:10%
of clinical benefits
such as survival,

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:10%
FDA will rely on
objective evidence

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.920 align:middle line:10%
of partial response,
such as tumor shrinkage,

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:10%
as an initial
basis for approval.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
This will allow us to rely
on smaller, shorter studies

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.620 align:middle line:84%
for the initial approval
of cancer drugs.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:10%
The second proposal.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.570 align:middle line:10%
We will expedite
the availability

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:10%
of promising medications
that had been approved

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.460 align:middle line:10%
in certain other countries.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Third, we will include
representatives

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:84%
of cancer patients in FDA's
Cancer Advisory Committees,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and thereby make sure that
their views are heard,

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:19.050 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to recommending
approval or non-approval

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.760 align:middle line:90%
of cancer drugs.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.840 align:middle line:10%
And forth, we will eliminate
unnecessary paperwork

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:10%
that use to delay
or discourage cancer

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:10%
research by noncommercial
clinical investigators.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd be happy to take
a few questions.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir?

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:38.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Will the FDA's initiatives
that you announced today

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:middle line:10%
expedite the current review
of antineoplastons treatment?

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:52.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The FDA's initiatives
will allow the agency to rely

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:57.990 align:middle line:10%
on smaller trials,
fewer patients,

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:10%
if there is evidence of partial
response in clinical trials.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to get into
any particular agent.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.390 align:middle line:10%
Except let me point out
that the information needs

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.190 align:middle line:10%
to be part of clinical trials.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:10%
We will accept less
information upfront.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:20.000 align:middle line:10%
We're going to require
further study after approval,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:10%
because the science has matured.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:10%
But the important point
is that information

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.640 align:middle line:10%
needs to be gathered
through scientific means

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:10%
through clinical trials.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.880 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's a very
important, very important

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:10%
point.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't just use an
agent here or there.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to use it as
part of a clinical trial

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.170 align:middle line:84%
so we can get information
on whether the drug works.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Will patients who have
taken other forms of cancer

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.990 align:middle line:84%
treatments, chemo, or
radiation treatments be allowed

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to participate in trials
for antineoplastons?

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:06.960 align:middle line:10%
>> The Agency has approved
trials for patients with

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:10%
antineoplastons.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.020 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:10%
>> What are antineoplastons
for the layman here?

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Again, I don't want to focus
on any one particular cancer

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:10%
compound.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.330 align:middle line:84%
They relate to
certain compounds that

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:84%
are being used
and being promoted

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.100 align:middle line:90%
by a physician in Texas.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:10%
We are committed to
providing expanded access

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.030 align:middle line:10%
and availability to American
patients for any drug

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.635 align:middle line:10%
that there's no reason
to believe may work.

00:43:33.635 --> 00:43:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.510 align:middle line:10%
>> They would not back
down in making sure

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:45.880 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski's criminal
trial moved forward.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.240 align:middle line:10%
Federal prosecutors concede
that a cancer doctor

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:10%
they were put on
trial here in January

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.430 align:middle line:10%
for using an innovative
but unapproved drug

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:57.040 align:middle line:10%
has been saving lives.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:10%
The prosecution
marks the first time

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.200 align:middle line:10%
the FDA has tried to jail
a scientist for using

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:10%
a drug on which he is conducting
FDA-authorized clinical trials.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.800 align:middle line:10%
In a pretrial motion, Assistant
US attorney Mike Clark

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:10%
objected to a defense
request for the jury

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.390 align:middle line:10%
to visit the chemical
plant where Dr. Burzynski

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.460 align:middle line:10%
manufactures antineoplaston.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.000 align:middle line:10%
The jury visit request is
"a thinly veiled effort

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.940 align:middle line:10%
to expose the jury to the
specter of Dr. Burzynski

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.930 align:middle line:10%
in his act of saving lives."

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.800 align:middle line:10%


00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.510 align:middle line:10%
"Whether antineoplaston does or
does not work is not an issue,

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:10%
and the jury should not be
asked to decide the question.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.410 align:middle line:10%
He added that if the
issue comes up at trial,

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:44.960 align:middle line:10%
it would be an
irrelevant, emotional,

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.248 align:middle line:10%
prejudicial, and
misleading concern."

00:44:47.248 --> 00:44:50.960 align:middle line:90%


00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The issue of whether
antineoplastons work may not

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:55.580 align:middle line:10%
even come up during the trial.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.090 align:middle line:10%
The judge says
that's not relevant.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But the defense contends
that's exactly the point,

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that what was done in
developing the drug

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and administering it
was done to save lives.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> This trial cost the American
taxpayer $60 billion dollars

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.020 align:middle line:84%
while costing Dr. Burzynski
over $2.2 million.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:84%
$700,000 of Burzynski's legal
defense was raised primarily

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.400 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Julian Whitaker
through his newsletter "Health

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and Healing."

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:84%
After Dr. Whitaker wrote of
the plight and injustice being

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.330 align:middle line:84%
done to Dr.
Burzynski, his readers

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:33.350 align:middle line:84%
sent in close to 18,000
checks in small donations

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:36.500 align:middle line:90%
for Burzynski's legal defense.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The trial is expected
to last about two months.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.480 align:middle line:84%
The jury will then decide
whether Burzynski is

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.569 align:middle line:90%
a fraud or a medical pioneer.

00:45:43.569 --> 00:45:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.010 align:middle line:10%
>> On March 4th, 1997,
due to a deadlocked jury,

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.770 align:middle line:10%
the judge declared a mistrial.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And after saying the
government had not

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.170 align:middle line:84%
presented sufficient
evidence, he

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
ordered that Dr. Burzynski
be acquitted of nearly half

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.000 align:middle line:90%
of the 75 counts.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> You voted to acquit?

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> To acquit.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Not guilty.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Not guilty.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.111 align:middle line:90%
>> I voted for acquittal.

00:46:12.111 --> 00:46:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I voted my mind.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.060 align:middle line:90%
In my heart--

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I do not believe that
Dr. Burzynski is a criminal.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And I had voted to acquit.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But the FDA was
still not backing down.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They took Dr. Burzynski
to trial again.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Though after apparently
accepting the absurdity

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
of their case, on
May 19th, the FDA

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.730 align:middle line:84%
suddenly dropped 40 of
the 41 remaining charges.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:84%
The FDA's facade in
trying to convince

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.530 align:middle line:84%
the world that
Burzynski was a criminal

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.630 align:middle line:90%
was completely unraveling.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Even the jurors, who voted
not guilty in the first case,

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.240 align:middle line:84%
took time off of work
to join the patients'

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.920 align:middle line:84%
protest in front
of the courthouse

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.600 align:middle line:90%
during the second case.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I am appalled at the
Food and Drug Administration

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and their actions.

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> We are today basically
to protest the witch hunt

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:90%
that's going on by the FDA.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to stick together and
really support these patients

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that are suffering,
not only healthwise,

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:13.650 align:middle line:84%
but having to come down here to
make a stand against the FDA.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Please don't waste my money
abusing the system to make sure

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.080 align:middle line:90%
that you maintain your power.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The jury spent about three
hours deliberating this house

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:10%
of cards, leaving Burzynski
acquitted of the final charge.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Every one of Dr.
Burzynski's patients now,

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.340 align:middle line:10%
every future of
Burzynski patient,

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.350 align:middle line:10%
is and will be on
a clinical trial.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:41.684 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.684 --> 00:47:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many patients
who would like to testify

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:48.680 align:middle line:84%
on our behalf and convince the
jury and the judge that without

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.280 align:middle line:90%
the treatment, they will die.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But the judge did not
admit any statements

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.680 align:middle line:84%
which could show that the
treatment is effective.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The judge did not allow the
jury to visit our facility where

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.880 align:middle line:90%
we produce medicine.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to keep
it away from the jury.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:84%
If this information would
be presented to the jurors,

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.810 align:middle line:84%
then this trial would be
finished very quickly.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the jurors
told, because after the trial,

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:19.780 align:middle line:84%
we talked to the jurors,
and they were shocked

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.332 align:middle line:84%
that such information
about the treatment,

00:48:23.332 --> 00:48:25.040 align:middle line:84%
which is saving the
life of the patients,

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:90%
was not presented to them.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was sick listening
to the lies of prosecutors

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.950 align:middle line:90%
from US attorneys.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It was not necessary
for them to do.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:90%
They could tell the truth.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.110 align:middle line:84%
They represented
the biggest power.

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But they still were
doing this all the time.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying
to do it a sneaky way.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.495 align:middle line:90%
And that's what is horrible.

00:48:44.495 --> 00:48:46.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what should be exposed,
because I think the United

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:48.070 align:middle line:90%
States deserves better.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:middle line:10%
>> While all of this
was taking place,

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.190 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski knew that the easiest
way to keep the government from

00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.030 align:middle line:10%
putting him out of business or
in prison was to partner with

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:01.980 align:middle line:10%
an established
pharmaceutical company.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.320 align:middle line:10%
And interest was shown from
Japanese pharmaceutical

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.220 align:middle line:10%
company, Chuo-ku and to the
Italian pharmaceutical company

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.510 align:middle line:10%
Sigma-Tau.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.300 align:middle line:10%
But both deals
eventually evaporated,

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.630 align:middle line:10%
likely due to the
rapport developed so far

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:20.850 align:middle line:10%
between antineoplastons and
the FDA, being an issue indeed,

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.220 align:middle line:10%
and were unable to
verify the likelihood

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.180 align:middle line:10%
that they could openly and
effectively work with the FDA.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Then by 1990, it seemed that
Burzynski's luck had finally

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:32.950 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Berzinski had apparently
treated the sister-in-law

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:42.390 align:middle line:84%
of the chairman and CEO
of a Elan Pharmaceuticals.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Elan enthusiastically
drafted a letter of intent,

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
stating they would
aggressively pursue

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.860 align:middle line:84%
the filing of
necessary protocols

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.480 align:middle line:84%
with the Food and
Drug Administration

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:84%
for approval and marketing
of antineoplastons as quickly

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.680 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They soon negotiated financing,
licensing agreements,

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.050 align:middle line:90%
and royalties.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.810 align:middle line:10%
In the midst of closing
this deal with Elan,

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:05.700 align:middle line:10%
more good news emerged.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.050 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Dvorit Samid, a scientist
and medical professor

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:12.960 align:middle line:10%
from Maryland, who Burzynski
had hired to further study

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.720 align:middle line:10%
antineoplastons, managed
to present her work

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.630 align:middle line:10%
at an oncology symposium
in Switzerland, which

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:23.610 align:middle line:10%
landed her and antineoplastons
a cover story in a 1990

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:26.570 align:middle line:10%
issue of "Oncology News."

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:32.980 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1989, we retained Dr.
Dvorit Samid as our consultant.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Samid at that time, worked
at Uniformed Services Medical

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.210 align:middle line:84%
School in Baltimore,
and later, she

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:44.610 align:middle line:84%
moved to the National
Cancer Institute.

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:49.020 align:middle line:84%
She did a lot of work with
antineoplaston ingredients.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, when the
pharmaceutical company

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:56.690 align:middle line:84%
entered the picture, such
as Elan Pharmaceutical,

00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.210 align:middle line:84%
our consultant, Dr.
Samid, became too close.

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:03.550 align:middle line:10%
She really became consultant
for Elan Pharmaceutical,

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:08.490 align:middle line:10%
and she was working with
Elan from this time.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:10%
>> And suddenly, Elan
Pharmaceuticals terminated

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.210 align:middle line:10%
their licensing agreement,
stating Elan has significant

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:18.090 align:middle line:10%
doubt as to whether the
active substances comprising

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:21.270 align:middle line:10%
of antineoplastons
have patent protection,

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:24.355 align:middle line:10%
thereby rendering an
agreement meaningless.

00:51:24.355 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Antineoplastons are
not just one chemical.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.640 align:middle line:84%
They have different
ingredients in antineoplastons.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:36.150 align:middle line:84%
One of these ingredients
was known before.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:40.020 align:middle line:84%
We discovered that is a
metabolite of antineoplaston,

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and was known and
was available before.

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:47.593 align:middle line:84%
So when we patented
our invention,

00:51:47.593 --> 00:51:50.520 align:middle line:84%
our lawyers told
us, look, you can't

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.350 align:middle line:84%
patent this
particular ingredient

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:53.850 align:middle line:90%
because it was known before.

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:54.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's list it in your
patent, but don't patent this,

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.730 align:middle line:84%
because you'll never
get patent for that.

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:01.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But this is the least important
ingredient of antineoplastons.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> While this was an
odd turn of events,

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.910 align:middle line:84%
more good news
continued to pour in.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:16.080 align:middle line:10%
It was in October 1991
when Dr. Nicholas Patronas

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.480 align:middle line:10%
led the National Cancer
Institute on their site

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.110 align:middle line:10%
to visit, the very same site to
visit Dr. Patronas would later

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.510 align:middle line:10%
base his testimony when
defending Burzynski

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:26.460 align:middle line:10%
against the Texas Medical Board.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.850 align:middle line:10%
This site visit not only
confirmed that antineoplastons

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:33.180 align:middle line:10%
were curing what was previously
considered incurable brain

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.120 align:middle line:10%
cancer, but it
garnered their interest

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.150 align:middle line:10%
in conducting a confirmatory
trial under Division

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:42.090 align:middle line:10%
of Cancer Treatment sponsorship
at the National Cancer

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:43.770 align:middle line:10%
Institute.

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:46.740 align:middle line:10%
These trials involved
most of their top experts,

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:51.540 align:middle line:10%
including Dr. Michael Friedman,
the Associate Director

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.480 align:middle line:10%
of the Cancer Therapy
Evaluation Program.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.060 align:middle line:10%
In a memo addressed
to his director,

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.520 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Friedman wrote,
"I thought you

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.350 align:middle line:10%
would be interested in this.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:10%
Antineoplastons
deserve a closer look.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:09.390 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that the agents
are well-defined, pure chemical

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:11.250 align:middle line:10%
entities.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.942 align:middle line:10%
The human brain tumor
responses are real."

00:53:13.942 --> 00:53:16.780 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The National Cancer
Institute's Decision Network

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.870 align:middle line:84%
then convened and
gave the green light

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to conduct government-sponsored
clinical trials

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:27.720 align:middle line:90%
of antineoplastons.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, everybody was
really excited about it.

00:53:29.907 --> 00:53:31.240 align:middle line:10%
Everybody would like to proceed.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The people who
reviewed our results,

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:38.080 align:middle line:84%
the experts from the NCI,
they did a very good job.

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.600 align:middle line:84%
They were critical, of
course, but they were also

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.390 align:middle line:84%
highly complimentary for
the way we treat patients

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:46.600 align:middle line:90%
and the results we got.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It looks like everything should
open, and we move forward.

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, everything
came to a stop.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.485 align:middle line:84%
And then we found out
a few months later,

00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Elan had received permission
to do clinical trials

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.970 align:middle line:90%
with this particular ingredient.

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Ours was pushed back for
something like 40 years,

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and then Elan was allowed to
proceed with this one suddenly.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When Elan terminated their
business deal with Burzynski,

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.420 align:middle line:84%
they went behind his
back, recruited Dr.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:18.770 align:middle line:10%
Dvorit Samid and partnered with
the National Cancer Institute,

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:22.280 align:middle line:10%
where Dr. Samid soon
became a section chief.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.950 align:middle line:10%
Elan then co-sponsored
laboratory research

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:28.430 align:middle line:10%
and clinical trials testing
only this single ingredient

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.370 align:middle line:10%
called phenylacetate,
the same chemical

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.430 align:middle line:10%
that Burzynski was advised
he couldn't patent, and had

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:37.160 align:middle line:10%
already proven to be quite
limited against cancer

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.234 align:middle line:10%
as a single substance
as far back as 1980.

00:54:41.234 --> 00:54:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> After the treatment of
a small number of patients,

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:47.400 align:middle line:84%
we found that the activity
was quite limited.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why we decided to
abandon phenylacetate,

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and we use the other
antineoplastons.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.610 align:middle line:84%
One of them contains
phenylacetate

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:58.240 align:middle line:90%
as the second ingredient.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.830 align:middle line:10%
Phenylacetate alone has
very small activity.

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.850 align:middle line:10%
It's not very effective.

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:10.430 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1994, I started
working for Dvorit Samid.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:14.870 align:middle line:10%
She didn't let me know
that one of those compounds

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:17.710 align:middle line:10%
is from Burzynski,
Dr. Burzynski.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.360 align:middle line:10%
You know, she just
said phenylacetate,

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.010 align:middle line:10%
and she showed me
all the published

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:25.500 align:middle line:10%
papers about phenylacetate
and its analogs

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.230 align:middle line:10%
and their anticancer activity.

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:35.420 align:middle line:10%
It was quite amazing in
the lab, because if you

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:38.770 align:middle line:10%
find a compound that
has anticancer activity

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:43.130 align:middle line:10%
and then you find
a bunch of analogs,

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:48.620 align:middle line:10%
it's like you stumbled
in a pile of gold.

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.200 align:middle line:10%
So people would think
and they'd say, you know,

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.960 align:middle line:10%
"patents," "patents," "patents."

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.500 align:middle line:10%
You know, that sort of thing.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.900 align:middle line:10%
With Dvorit, under
her leadership,

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:07.230 align:middle line:10%
we found a lot of biological
activities in these compounds.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:11.400 align:middle line:10%
So it would have
anti-cancer activities.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.420 align:middle line:10%
So the scientists
at Johns Hopkins

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:18.170 align:middle line:10%
tried to patent these compounds.

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.500 align:middle line:10%
But of, course
Dvorit was working

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.270 align:middle line:10%
with Elan Pharmaceutical
company at that time,

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:29.100 align:middle line:10%
so those guys at Johns
Hopkins didn't have any chance

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.420 align:middle line:10%
of patenting those compounds.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:36.320 align:middle line:10%
So you know, but
it's interesting

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.480 align:middle line:10%
that she would
complain in the lab,

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:43.470 align:middle line:10%
and saying that these guys
tried to go behind her back

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:46.640 align:middle line:10%
and patent these compounds.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.610 align:middle line:10%
>> While Burzynski was facing
continuous harassment from

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:53.270 align:middle line:10%
state and federal agencies, the
earliest phenylacetate studies

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:57.410 align:middle line:10%
were published in April of
'92, authored by Dvorit Samid,

00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:00.240 align:middle line:10%
hosted by the National
Cancer Institute.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.710 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski sat in awe as he
witnessed the National Cancer

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:06.140 align:middle line:10%
Institute recruit one
of his researchers,

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:09.710 align:middle line:10%
push his research aside, and
begin to test phenylacetate

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:12.410 align:middle line:10%
without him, reporting
"phenylacetate

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:14.600 align:middle line:10%
is both effective in
inducing tumor cell

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.800 align:middle line:10%
maturation and free of cytotoxic
and carcinogenic effects,

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.750 align:middle line:10%
a combination that
warrants attention

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:23.530 align:middle line:10%
to its potential use in
cancer intervention."

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:29.060 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1995, in the lab,
I was still with Dvorit,

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.460 align:middle line:10%
but I smelled fishy.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.620 align:middle line:10%
Something is not right.

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.030 align:middle line:84%
The first paper Dvorit
published about phenylacetate,

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:41.020 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
methodology section,

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:90%
there's a BRI abbreviation.

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:48.740 align:middle line:10%
She got materials from
Burzynski Research Institute,

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.430 align:middle line:10%
Houston, Texas.

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:54.260 align:middle line:10%
But it didn't say Burzynski
Research Institute.

00:57:54.260 --> 00:58:01.250 align:middle line:10%
For us as scientists,
it's a funny practice.

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:04.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Burzynski's name failed to
appear in the acknowledgements

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.430 align:middle line:10%
or any of the references
listed in this report.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski knew these
tests would fail,

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:12.350 align:middle line:84%
since he had already proven
this in his own laboratory 12

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:13.400 align:middle line:90%
years before.

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.530 align:middle line:10%
Abandoned by the National
Cancer Institute,

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.660 align:middle line:10%
he sat powerless
on the sidelines

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.090 align:middle line:10%
as the attempted
hijacking of his discovery

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:23.750 align:middle line:10%
unfolded before his eyes, ending
in the hideous trainwreck he

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:25.160 align:middle line:10%
warned them it would.

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.340 align:middle line:84%
The National Cancer
Institute, Elan, and Dr. Samid

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.100 align:middle line:84%
spent over four years
and tens of millions

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.510 align:middle line:84%
of dollars testing
phenylacetate.

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Phenylacetate,
really by itself,

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:40.266 align:middle line:10%
has very little clinical effect.

00:58:40.266 --> 00:58:43.385 align:middle line:84%
>> The SEI or Elan could not
use the other ingredients

00:58:43.385 --> 00:58:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of antineoplastons because they
were covered by the patents

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.610 align:middle line:90%
owned by me.

00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:49.390 align:middle line:10%
They were trying to
commercialize this,

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.260 align:middle line:10%
but without the
other ingredients,

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.380 align:middle line:10%
they couldn't do much with this.

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:57.150 align:middle line:84%
This needed to be given in
conjunction with the others.

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> While coming to
terms with this reality,

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the National Cancer
Institute decided to honor

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.110 align:middle line:84%
the government-sponsored
clinical trials

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of antineoplastons they had
initially promised Burzynski

00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:09.900 align:middle line:90%
in 1991.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> These trials have been
conducted at the Mayo Clinic

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.210 align:middle line:84%
in Minnesota and the
Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:16.110 align:middle line:90%
York.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Currently, there are only
eight patients enrolled.

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.610 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm very
dissatisfied with that,

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:25.170 align:middle line:10%
because our desire is to
achieve the proper enrollment

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:28.410 align:middle line:10%
in as quickly a manner as we
can in order to really test this

00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:29.610 align:middle line:10%
hypothesis.

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:32.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Friedman blamed Burzynski
for this slow motion,

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:35.850 align:middle line:10%
saying Burzynski restricted
admissions to the trials too

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:37.320 align:middle line:10%
stringently.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.530 align:middle line:84%
To speed things up, admissions
standards for the trials

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:42.750 align:middle line:84%
have been lowered
to bring in patients

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:46.590 align:middle line:84%
in worse physical condition,
this over Dr. Burzynski's

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:48.240 align:middle line:90%
strenuous objections.

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> They got the idea that the
main interest is to let this

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:55.450 align:middle line:84%
patient die rapidly and make
sure the treatment would never

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:56.250 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Burzynski has threatened
legal action to halt these new

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:02.880 align:middle line:84%
admissions, and NCI has
suspended recruiting,

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.520 align:middle line:84%
leaving the trials with
just those scientifically

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.490 align:middle line:90%
unsatisfactory eight patients.

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, both the FDA
and the Texas Medical Board

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.490 align:middle line:84%
are still trying
to stop Burzynski.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:17.520 align:middle line:10%
>> On May 8 of '95, less
than two weeks before this

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.760 align:middle line:10%
broadcast, the National Cancer
Institute issued an internal

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
memo to all of those involved
in the antineoplaston trials.

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.380 align:middle line:10%
For the record, the clinical
trials monitoring service

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.980 align:middle line:10%
has been instructed not to
send any antineoplastons

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.530 align:middle line:10%
clinical trial data
to Dr. Burzynski,

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:37.830 align:middle line:10%
the Burzynski Research
Institute, or anyone inquiring

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:40.800 align:middle line:10%
about the antineoplastons
clinical trials.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Any inquiries that may be
related to the trials or Dr.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:48.150 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski are to be referred
to the Associate Director, Dr.

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:49.710 align:middle line:10%
Michael Friedman.

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Friedman then taunts Burzynski.

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.690 align:middle line:10%
"I must convey my
deep pessimism.

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:58.560 align:middle line:10%
We are in no way obligated
to obtain your consent.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.780 align:middle line:10%
Your insistence on dictating
the manner in which we conduct

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.870 align:middle line:10%
or review these
clinical trials is

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:06.540 align:middle line:10%
both presumptuous
and inappropriate.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%
The future of these trials
rests entirely with the NCI,

01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:15.390 align:middle line:10%
since our primary obligation
is to the American public."

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:16.890 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski responds.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:20.370 align:middle line:10%
"Your letter of June
6 conveys pessimism.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.590 align:middle line:10%
My letter conveys outrage.

01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:25.470 align:middle line:10%
Patients were admitted
against admission criteria.

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Their treatment
was discontinued,

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.270 align:middle line:10%
and their lives were jeopardized
for frivolous reasons.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.370 align:middle line:10%
In spite of your
promise, we never

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:35.820 align:middle line:10%
received any detailed
data on these patients.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.680 align:middle line:10%
There must be a
reason why you are

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.230 align:middle line:10%
afraid to provide us
with complete copies

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.080 align:middle line:10%
of medical records.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.240 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It took us at least half
a year before we force NCI

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to release some of
this information to us.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we found that they
severely violated protocol.

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
They did not comply to
always the protocol.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
On top of that,
patients were forced

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to stop the treatment of
antineoplastons because

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
of massive fluid retention.

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Did

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is something which we
don't see with antineoplastons.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.570 align:middle line:10%
Typical with antineoplastons
is dehydration,

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:16.934 align:middle line:10%
which means elimination
of the fluids.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.100 align:middle line:10%
The patients are losing a
lot of fluids to the point

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.010 align:middle line:10%
that they have to drink
a lot of extra fluids.

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:24.650 align:middle line:10%
We don't see increased
fluid retention.

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:26.555 align:middle line:10%
I was curious why
this could happen.

01:02:26.555 --> 01:02:28.180 align:middle line:10%
I knew that the
patients were receiving

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.850 align:middle line:10%
a lot of intravenous fluid.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.600 align:middle line:10%
But then, we learn
that because the fluid

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.500 align:middle line:10%
which they were receiving
were not antineoplastons.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:41.090 align:middle line:10%
In October of 1995, the National
Cancer Institute's Cancer

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.090 align:middle line:10%
Information Service
issued a public statement

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:46.850 align:middle line:10%
for anyone inquiring about
their clinical trials

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.100 align:middle line:10%
of antineoplastons.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:53.270 align:middle line:10%
In it, they stated "because
these studies were closed prior

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.060 align:middle line:10%
to completion, no
conclusions can

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.450 align:middle line:10%
be made about the
effectiveness or toxicity

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:01.640 align:middle line:10%
of antineoplastons."

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.060 align:middle line:10%
To their credit, and according
to the scientific standards set

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.160 align:middle line:10%
by the National
Cancer Institute,

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.770 align:middle line:10%
this was indeed the truth.

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:13.460 align:middle line:10%
However, four years after
these trials were closed

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.430 align:middle line:10%
and two years after
Burzynski defeated the FDA

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:19.940 align:middle line:10%
and won his freedom, the
National Cancer Institute just

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.670 align:middle line:10%
couldn't leave well
enough alone and decided

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:26.070 align:middle line:10%
to vindictively publish
these scientifically invalid

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:29.540 align:middle line:10%
antineoplastons trials in
the peer-reviewed medical

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.800 align:middle line:10%
literature.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
In it, they described how
nine patients were treated

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and no patient demonstrated
tumor regression.

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:41.390 align:middle line:10%
However, whoever was responsible
for publishing this report was

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:44.120 align:middle line:10%
apparently careless
enough to also include

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.490 align:middle line:10%
the antineoplastons
concentrations

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:50.390 align:middle line:10%
detected in the blood of the
nine patients during treatment.

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:54.800 align:middle line:10%
>> We compared this to the data
which we have in our studies.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
We found that they were
severely diluting the medicine,

01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and this was why the
patient had fluid overload.

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Antineoplaston AS2-1
consists of two ingredients,

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
which is called phenylacetate
and phenylacetylglutamine,

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and about 2.7 lower
level of phenylacetate

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
in patients' blood compared to
what we see in our patients who

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:20.466 align:middle line:90%
receive successful treatment.

01:04:20.466 --> 01:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Phenylacetylglutamine, there
is about 36 times lower level

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
in patients' blood
compared to what

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.275 align:middle line:84%
we see in our patients
given the right dosage

01:04:29.275 --> 01:04:31.810 align:middle line:90%
of antineoplastons.

01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And the concentrations of
phenylacetylisoglutamine,

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the main ingredients
of antineoplaston A10

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:42.200 align:middle line:84%
were close to 170
times lower than what

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.473 align:middle line:84%
we see in the treatment of
patients with antineoplastons.

01:04:46.473 --> 01:04:49.610 align:middle line:90%


01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we found
from the patients' husbands

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.810 align:middle line:90%
or the patients themselves.

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:56.525 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
were doing good.

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.400 align:middle line:90%
So this was horrible.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.510 align:middle line:90%
This was like a criminal act.

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:02.342 align:middle line:84%
They should be prosecuted for
that, because obviously, they

01:05:02.342 --> 01:05:03.800 align:middle line:84%
knew what they were
doing, and they

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.594 align:middle line:84%
knew that these
patients have no change

01:05:06.594 --> 01:05:07.760 align:middle line:90%
to respond to any treatment.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.400 align:middle line:90%
They are going to die.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
After we realized
what they do, we

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
decided to force them to
stop the clinical trials.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And since then, obviously,
National Cancer Institute

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.900 align:middle line:90%
hates us, OK?

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.100 align:middle line:90%
They do whatever they can.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
They do not cooperate
with us anymore.

01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:34.060 align:middle line:10%
In the past, when NCI
or its assigned entity

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:39.280 align:middle line:10%
is conducting an
alternative cancer therapy,

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.600 align:middle line:10%
they always altered
the protocol and let it

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.420 align:middle line:10%
fail to discredit the therapy.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.270 align:middle line:10%
But this time, the
pharmacokinetic data

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:56.890 align:middle line:10%
shows that they
didn't do it right.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:01.450 align:middle line:10%
And most scientists would
not look at it carefully,

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:04.160 align:middle line:10%
because "papa is
telling you something,

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.776 align:middle line:10%
and you don't question him."

01:06:05.776 --> 01:06:08.950 align:middle line:90%


01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> After the National Cancer
Institute intentionally

01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
violated all protocols of their
own antineoplaston trials,

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and after all state and
federal agencies had failed

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
in their 14-year campaign to
remove Burzynski from society,

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
after all of the dust settled, a
profound truth began to emerge.

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:33.010 align:middle line:10%
It was October 4th, 1991 that
America's National Cancer

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:36.190 align:middle line:10%
Institute hosted their site
visit to Burzynski's clinic

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:40.120 align:middle line:10%
and verified for themselves
that anti-tumor activity was

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:45.650 align:middle line:10%
documented by the use
of antineoplastons.

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:51.190 align:middle line:10%
17 days later, on
October 21st, 1991,

01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:54.140 align:middle line:10%
the United States of
America, as represented

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:59.520 align:middle line:10%
by the Department of
Health and Human Services

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.970 align:middle line:10%
and Dr. Dvorit
Samid, filed a patent

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.400 align:middle line:10%
for antineoplastons AS2-1.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.310 align:middle line:10%


01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:09.530 align:middle line:10%
They even had the
audacity to include

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:13.130 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski as a reference.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:17.090 align:middle line:10%
"The invention described herein
may be manufactured, used,

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:20.120 align:middle line:10%
and licensed by or
for the government

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.550 align:middle line:10%
for governmental purposes."

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:25.850 align:middle line:10%
At the time, Burzynski had
no idea this had happened,

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:29.060 align:middle line:10%
but did have his suspicions
when they began to openly test

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.540 align:middle line:10%
phenylacetate without him, and
the National Cancer Institute

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.390 align:middle line:10%
knew it.

01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
In an April '93 NCI
memo distributed

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.000 align:middle line:84%
to those involved
with Burzynski,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.560 align:middle line:90%
they state their concerns.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.200 align:middle line:10%
"Political issues
are a real concern.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.300 align:middle line:10%
Congressman Bedell
is concerned we

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:48.040 align:middle line:10%
are taking the antineoplastons
away from Burzynski.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.500 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski has patents
on antineoplastons.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Since phenyacetic
acid, or phenylacetate,

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
may be the active component
in antineoplastons,

01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
our involvement has
become an issue.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.350 align:middle line:10%
Five months later,
the United States

01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:06.250 align:middle line:10%
of America and Dr.
Dvorit Samid filed

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:09.740 align:middle line:10%
their second extended
patent on antineoplastons.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.110 align:middle line:10%
And guess who else was in it?

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:15.230 align:middle line:10%
In March of the
following year, America

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:20.660 align:middle line:10%
files its most extensive updated
antineoplaston patent to date,

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.350 align:middle line:10%
spanning 111 pages.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.200 align:middle line:10%
Seven months later,
they file a fourth one.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.220 align:middle line:10%
June 6, 1995, the
United States government

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.250 align:middle line:10%
has a field day filing
their fifth, sixth,

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:39.620 align:middle line:10%
seventh, and eighth extended
patent on antineoplastons.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:44.120 align:middle line:10%
The following day, America
files its ninth, 10th,

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.890 align:middle line:10%
and the 11th extended
antineoplaston patent.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:52.029 align:middle line:10%
And a couple of months after
the 11th patent was filed,

01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:55.899 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Michael Friedman leaves his
position at the National Cancer

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:59.170 align:middle line:10%
Institute and becomes
Deputy Commissioner

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:02.590 align:middle line:10%
of Operations for the Food
and Drug Administration

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:07.050 align:middle line:10%
working directly under
Dr. David Kessler.

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:10.260 align:middle line:10%
And by November of that
year, after a decade

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.109 align:middle line:10%
of failed grand juries,
the United States

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:15.600 align:middle line:10%
of America's Food and
Drug Administration

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.080 align:middle line:10%
finally manages to
indict Dr. Burzynski.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.029 align:middle line:10%
One month into
America's criminal trial

01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:24.240 align:middle line:10%
against Burzynski, America's
first patent on antineoplaston

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.600 align:middle line:10%
AS2-1 is approved.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.210 align:middle line:10%
A month after America
fails in their second trial

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:33.390 align:middle line:10%
against Burzynski, their
second and third antineoplaston

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:34.859 align:middle line:10%
patents are approved.

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of
the next three years,

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.240 align:middle line:84%
the United States Patent Office
approves all 11 copycat patents

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.560 align:middle line:90%
on antineoplastons AS2-1.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:49.520 align:middle line:90%


01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.399 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's enough.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
All of this was done based
on the fact that the United

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
States, which is the
National Institute of Health,

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.274 align:middle line:84%
together with pharmaceutical
companies such as Elan

01:09:58.274 --> 01:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Pharmaceuticals, were trying
simply to steal my invention.

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:03.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what they wanted.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we had successful
visits from the National Cancer

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Institute in which
they determined

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:12.470 align:middle line:84%
that this treatment
works great, and they

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
decided that we should
go through Phase II

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
clinical trials, which would
be responsible by them.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
This gave the idea of
some higher-ups at FDA

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.427 align:middle line:84%
to conspire with
pharmaceutical company

01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
so that they can steal the
invention from me and get it,

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.130 align:middle line:90%
because it was good, OK?

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:30.680 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it started, OK?

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they knew that
if I was still free,

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.470 align:middle line:90%
they won't be able to do it.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that
if I would sue them,

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have
a chance in court,

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
because we have
our patents before.

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
attempts from them

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to wipe me out financially,
to put me to prison,

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:54.975 align:middle line:84%
to attack me from every
possible angle, the FDA, which

01:10:54.975 --> 01:10:58.130 align:middle line:84%
is federal government,
state government, to be

01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%
able to steal my invention.

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:00.310 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:04.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the real thing from
the National Cancer Institute

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.150 align:middle line:90%
and Elan pharmaceuticals.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:09.030 align:middle line:90%
But they failed.

01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:11.472 align:middle line:84%
We survived, and
we move forward.

01:11:11.472 --> 01:11:14.210 align:middle line:90%


01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>> These patents are full
of useful information.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.050 align:middle line:10%
Aside from noticing their
blatant infringement,

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:23.810 align:middle line:10%
compositions and methods
for treating and preventing

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:29.030 align:middle line:10%
cancer using the distribution
of antineoplastons AS1-2

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:31.820 align:middle line:10%
ingredients, they
enthusiastically

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.460 align:middle line:10%
state that "neoplastic
conditions treatable

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:38.410 align:middle line:10%
by this method include
neuroblastoma, leukemia,

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:43.070 align:middle line:10%
myelodisplasia, acute glioma,
prostate cancer, breast cancer,

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:46.400 align:middle line:10%
melanoma, lung cancer,
medulloblastoma,

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.250 align:middle line:10%
and lymphoma" to name a few.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:52.940 align:middle line:84%
They also point out how
antineoplastons can also be

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.600 align:middle line:90%
used as a cancer preventative.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.590 align:middle line:10%
However, the most
revealing piece

01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:59.630 align:middle line:10%
of information found
on these patents

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:01.940 align:middle line:10%
is where they state
"current approaches

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:06.050 align:middle line:10%
to combat cancer rely primarily
on the use of chemicals

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:09.890 align:middle line:10%
and radiation, which are
themselves carcinogenic and may

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:13.010 align:middle line:10%
promote recurrences
and the development

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:14.660 align:middle line:10%
of metastatic disease."

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.320 align:middle line:10%
Let's read that one
again, shall we?

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.740 align:middle line:10%
Current approaches
to combat cancer

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.290 align:middle line:10%
rely primarily on the use
of chemicals and radiation,

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:24.710 align:middle line:10%

of metastatic disease."

01:12:29.862 --> 01:12:34.580 align:middle line:90%


01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:37.130 align:middle line:10%
>> They sometimes have a creed.

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:41.310 align:middle line:10%
It's to separate medicine
from the medicine man.

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:45.525 align:middle line:10%
And of course, these higher up
at NCI or whatever, they think,

01:12:45.525 --> 01:12:49.440 align:middle line:10%
hey, guys we have been
doing this for years.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.050 align:middle line:10%
We know what's going on.

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:54.090 align:middle line:10%
So they think,
well, we know what's

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:58.530 align:middle line:10%
going on with phenylacetate
phenylacetylglutamine.

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:01.950 align:middle line:10%
If you can outsmart
the medicine man,

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:05.720 align:middle line:10%
you can cut a piece
of a pie for yourself.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.100 align:middle line:10%
That's the name of the game if
you cannot be the first one.

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:15.110 align:middle line:10%
If you can be the second one and
be bigger than the first one.

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:16.170 align:middle line:10%
Steal.

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:17.980 align:middle line:10%
Why not?

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.300 align:middle line:10%
That's the mentality.

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:24.470 align:middle line:10%
You know, under capitalist
sun, there's nothing sacred.

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:26.152 align:middle line:90%
Money talks.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:30.158 align:middle line:84%
>> The smear campaign against
us continues from good doctors,

01:13:30.158 --> 01:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
from American
Medical Association,

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
from American Cancer Society,
despite the fact it should stop

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.410 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you mean
by this plaston study?

01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:42.920 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Antineoplastons are peptides
which I discovered which can

01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:50.320 align:middle line:10%
stimulate genes
which fight cancer,

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.020 align:middle line:10%
and which can decrease the
activity of the genes which

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:54.821 align:middle line:10%
cause cancer.

01:13:54.821 --> 01:13:56.028 align:middle line:10%
These are molecular switches.

01:13:56.028 --> 01:13:57.080 align:middle line:10%
>> You published that?

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:57.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:58.270 align:middle line:10%
We published.

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.080 align:middle line:10%
I published about 300 articles.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.900 align:middle line:10%
I presented numerous
at tumor conferences.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.400 align:middle line:10%
>> That seems revolutionary.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.480 align:middle line:10%
Do you discount that?

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I've known of
what he's been doing.

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And I think the work
that he's doing,

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:13.610 align:middle line:10%
there's no scientific evidence
that it provides any benefit

01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:14.647 align:middle line:10%
for cancer patients.

01:14:14.647 --> 01:14:16.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you discounting
all the work he does?

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.940 align:middle line:10%
He also states that there
is no complications or very

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:22.100 align:middle line:10%
little complications
in his treatment.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.320 align:middle line:10%
And I've actually had one
patient that went to him

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:29.580 align:middle line:10%
and had the treatment
and almost died.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Four years
after my diagnosis,

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:36.450 align:middle line:10%
I had run into one of the
neuro-oncologists I met with

01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:40.920 align:middle line:10%
and told him that I had gone to
Dr. Burzynski and I was cured.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.980 align:middle line:10%
And he kind of wrote it off.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.160 align:middle line:10%
I was very excited to
tell him that I was cured,

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.690 align:middle line:10%
and he really burst
my bubble about it,

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:53.310 align:middle line:10%
so it was somewhat
depressing for me.

01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:56.550 align:middle line:10%
>> You have an amazing story
of survival sitting right next

01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:59.070 align:middle line:10%
to you, a young woman
named Jodi Gold.

01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:01.020 align:middle line:10%
Jodi, I understand
that you actually

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:05.580 align:middle line:10%
had a very advanced malignant
brain tumor diagnosed right

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.200 align:middle line:10%
before you turned 32 years old.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.970 align:middle line:10%
And here you are with us today.

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:10.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:13.140 align:middle line:10%
And I'm actually here today
because I participated

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.580 align:middle line:10%
in a clinical trial.

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:17.366 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know why Dr. Black
is not telling the truth.

01:15:17.366 --> 01:15:20.630 align:middle line:10%
We conducted 12 Phase II
clinical trials and strict FDA

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:23.880 align:middle line:10%
supervision in every
one of these trials.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.280 align:middle line:10%
We have objective
responsibility.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.330 align:middle line:10%
We proved the treatment works.

01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:30.210 align:middle line:10%
The treatment can cure
incurable brain tumors.

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:33.690 align:middle line:10%
The patients can live not only
the five years tumor, but over

01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:36.840 align:middle line:10%
10 years tumor free,
from the types of tumors

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.360 align:middle line:10%
chemotherapy can do
absolutely nothing.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.590 align:middle line:10%
This is well-documented.

01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:43.330 align:middle line:10%
This was reviewed by the top
specialists in the United

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:44.130 align:middle line:10%
States.

01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:46.440 align:middle line:10%
But it was never
reviewed by Dr. Black.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.660 align:middle line:10%
He didn't agree with even
a single case did by us.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.130 align:middle line:10%
Why is that?

01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:50.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Why are you not open--

01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:52.800 align:middle line:10%
>> We treated patients who Dr.
Black advised should not come

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.550 align:middle line:10%
to us 11 years ago with
incurable brain tumors.

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.530 align:middle line:10%
Her tumor was gone
in two months.

01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:59.800 align:middle line:10%
Here it is now 11 years
later, in perfect health,

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.446 align:middle line:10%
living here in LA.

01:16:01.446 --> 01:16:02.820 align:middle line:10%
And Dr. Black told
her, "you will

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.195 align:middle line:10%
be wasting time and money
going to Dr. Burzynski."

01:16:05.195 --> 01:16:06.620 align:middle line:10%
Why are you doing
this, Dr. Black?

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Why are you not open to this?

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, I'm open
to anything that would benefit

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.370 align:middle line:90%
my patients.

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:17.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The doctors I know and
the clinicians I know,

01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:19.200 align:middle line:10%
these people are evangelical.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.790 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they are hugely
vested and invested

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:27.780 align:middle line:10%
in doing what they believe is
very important and good work.

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.330 align:middle line:10%
It helps them get up in
the morning to go to work.

01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:38.060 align:middle line:10%
So folks who are invested
in that kind of zealous way

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:43.916 align:middle line:10%
are going to look at anything
that isn't within that vision.

01:16:43.916 --> 01:16:45.540 align:middle line:10%
You know, they've
got to look at scans.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.390 align:middle line:10%
They've got to look at, you,
saying that really weird,

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:50.730 align:middle line:10%
or that's a charlatan.

01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:55.740 align:middle line:10%
>> My oncologist, the
radiologist, the MRI guy,

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:58.060 align:middle line:10%
everybody we talked to said,
you know, he's a quack.

01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.580 align:middle line:10%
You can't do-- you can't--

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.870 align:middle line:10%
you should not do that.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he's dangerous.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And we basically said,
well, we did our research,

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:09.900 align:middle line:10%
and this is what we want to
do, and you can't do anything

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:11.580 align:middle line:10%
for me, so why not?

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's not good.

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:13.630 align:middle line:10%
It's not smart.

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:14.430 align:middle line:10%
It's a fake.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:15.410 align:middle line:10%
It's a scam.

01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:16.740 align:middle line:10%
He's going to take your
money, and you're not

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.656 align:middle line:10%
going to get anything.

01:17:17.656 --> 01:17:20.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it was
everything that you'd

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:22.590 align:middle line:10%
hear from someone that didn't
know anything about it,

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:25.950 align:middle line:10%
but really didn't want to do it.

01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:28.980 align:middle line:10%
But they weren't in the
position that we were in.

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:32.790 align:middle line:10%
>> It didn't seem that they
had any facts and figures

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:35.580 align:middle line:10%
and concrete evidence
to debunk him.

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:36.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Good point.

01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:41.920 align:middle line:10%
>> It was just maybe
what they had heard?

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:49.420 align:middle line:10%
>> One doctor told Susan, if you
were my sister and you wanted

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:54.550 align:middle line:10%
to go to Dr. Burzynski's clinic,
I would stand on the runway

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:59.140 align:middle line:10%
in front of the airplane to
keep you from flying to Houston.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.420 align:middle line:10%
He got a little
dramatic about it.

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:05.590 align:middle line:10%
I got pretty thoroughly
annoyed with some

01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:07.960 align:middle line:10%
of these doctors
who would tell me,

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.730 align:middle line:10%
he's a crook, a
quack, a charlatan.

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:13.300 align:middle line:10%
He's never really cured anybody.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:17.690 align:middle line:10%
And I would ask them,
how do you know this?

01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:22.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's just what I've heard.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:27.180 align:middle line:10%
So I would say to them, if
you think you're a scientist,

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:31.860 align:middle line:10%
how can you go based on
just what you've heard?

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.350 align:middle line:10%
>> If Dr. Burzynski's
treatment is so effective,

01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:37.080 align:middle line:10%
and so many of his
patients say that it is,

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.440 align:middle line:10%
why then is it not used
here, at M.D. Anderson,

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.900 align:middle line:10%
one of the nation's
leading cancer hospitals?

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.670 align:middle line:10%
Simple, say doctors here.

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:46.159 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't cure cancer.

01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:48.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I don't have any
evidence, that's for certain.

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:51.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Maurie Markman is head
of research at M.D. Anderson.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.230 align:middle line:10%
>> His claims have certainly not
reached the level of acceptance

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.750 align:middle line:10%
in the medical community.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>> He says there could be lots
of explanations why certain

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.330 align:middle line:10%
patients recover, but to say
it's because of Burzynski's

01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:04.230 align:middle line:10%
treatment?

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:05.850 align:middle line:10%
You can't say that, he says.

01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:07.320 align:middle line:10%
And if there was such proof--

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.130 align:middle line:10%
If it worked, you'd
be all over it?

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:09.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:12.420 align:middle line:10%
>> But Dr. Burzynski thinks
there may be something else

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.220 align:middle line:10%
at work.

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:16.680 align:middle line:10%
Big institutions may not like
being upstaged by an outsider.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.200 align:middle line:10%
The doctor at M.D.
Anderson disagrees.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We've actually asked the
endocrinologist at MD Anderson

01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
about Dr. Burzynski, and
he told us he was a quack,

01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and that there was no
evidence that that worked.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But at that point,
it was like, well,

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
yours doesn't
really work either.

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:35.940 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, I looked at
it like, well, you know,

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.580 align:middle line:10%
if she's got approximately
nine months to live,

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:42.690 align:middle line:10%
then we come over here, and
we don't have all the side

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:45.930 align:middle line:10%
effects, well, in
nine months' time,

01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:48.210 align:middle line:10%
which am I going to
be better off doing,

01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:52.350 align:middle line:10%
if the ending
result is the same?

01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:56.370 align:middle line:10%
>> I think what is
amazing is that Dr.

01:19:56.370 --> 01:20:02.730 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski has had a vision and
a passion and a zeal for 40 odd

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:03.960 align:middle line:10%
years.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.750 align:middle line:10%
Put up with being
called everything

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:11.820 align:middle line:10%
short of and probably even
including witch doctor because

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:16.270 align:middle line:10%
of his firm belief that he
can save people's lives.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:20.580 align:middle line:10%
And what that says about
his character and just

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:27.540 align:middle line:10%
the fiber of his backbone,
to be willing to take that on

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:35.880 align:middle line:10%
and to be alive and
recognized when it happens.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.940 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there are many times in
history where great inventors,

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:44.010 align:middle line:10%
you know, the inventor
has basically died or was

01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:46.360 align:middle line:10%
impoverished before
they had a chance

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.610 align:middle line:10%
to see the fruition of
that great invention.

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:51.450 align:middle line:10%
And he's got a
chance of doing that.

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:55.980 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1840, Ignza Semmelweis,
an Austrian obstetrician,

01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.410 align:middle line:10%
noted that over 20%--

01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:middle line:10%
that's one out of five--
women giving birth

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:05.220 align:middle line:10%
in the hospital died four to six
days later of puerperal fever.

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
These women were then autopsied
in the basement of a hospital.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors who performed
these autopsies wore no gloves.

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, they
would leave the autopsy room

01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and go straight to
the delivery room

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:25.400 align:middle line:84%
to assist other births without
even washing their hands.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Then Dr. Semmelweis' good
friend and fellow physician

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.190 align:middle line:10%
accidentally cut his finger
while he was doing an autopsy.

01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
In six days, this doctor
died with the same signs

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.400 align:middle line:90%
and symptoms of puerperal fever.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
Semmelweis knew.

01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:44.270 align:middle line:84%
He realized that the doctors
were transferring the disease

01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
from the autopsy room
to the delivery room,

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and he urged his colleagues
to simply wash their hands.

01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
For this unforgivable
sacrilege, he was drummed out

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
of the medical profession, and
he died in an insane asylum.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Now today, we have the same
kind of arrogant commitment

01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:08.190 align:middle line:90%
to belief.

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But with cancer treatment, we
have a trillion dollar business

01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:14.710 align:middle line:90%
built on those beliefs.

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
Semmelweis had a problem,

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
just imagine the problem
Dr. Burzynski faces.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
There was no money
involved in hand-washing

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.560 align:middle line:90%
versus non hand-washing.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Sawanobori wants to
figure out how the clinic

01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:34.710 align:middle line:10%
administers antineoplastons
in targeted gene therapy.

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:37.020 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski has been
working with doctors in Japan

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.030 align:middle line:10%
for years.

01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:40.650 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it was evidence
from patients in Japan

01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:43.770 align:middle line:10%
that convinced the FDA here
to allow earlier studies

01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:45.210 align:middle line:10%
and stage two trials.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:52.120 align:middle line:10%
>> His method is a very safe
and also very effective.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:58.650 align:middle line:10%
So I'm sure that this is the new
strategy of cancer treatment.

01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:04.530 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:19.250 align:middle line:90%


01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>> They did the MRI and
discovered it was a brain stem

01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:22.640 align:middle line:10%
glioma.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.370 align:middle line:10%
And they explained
that hers was diffuse,

01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:27.470 align:middle line:10%
where it was like
the healthy tissue

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:30.140 align:middle line:10%
and the cancerous tissue
were swirled together.

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.740 align:middle line:10%
So of course, surgery
wasn't an option.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:36.350 align:middle line:10%
And with the radiation,
they suggested

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:40.040 align:middle line:10%
her prognosis was probably going
to be about eight to 18 months.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The thing is
with the radiation,

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:45.560 align:middle line:10%
what it would do to you from
what I understood was they

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.290 align:middle line:10%
would shoot the beam
through your ears,

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:53.300 align:middle line:10%
and the beam would burn your
healthy and your cancer cells

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.260 align:middle line:10%
outside in.

01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:57.530 align:middle line:10%
So all your hair around
your ears would be gone,

01:23:57.530 --> 01:24:01.610 align:middle line:10%
never grow back, your ears
would become deformed and burnt,

01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:05.810 align:middle line:10%
you would become deaf
because you couldn't hear.

01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:08.400 align:middle line:10%
It would also destroy
your pituitary gland,

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.150 align:middle line:10%
which is the gland that helps
you grow as you hit puberty.

01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:14.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, she was 11 at the time,
and that was a real concern I

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:15.670 align:middle line:10%
had.

01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>> And it'd make you stay
in an 11-year-old body,

01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:23.060 align:middle line:10%
and basically, in the end, you'd
become in a vegetative state,

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.800 align:middle line:10%
where you couldn't
take care of yourself,

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.966 align:middle line:10%
which wasn't a very good
quality of life in the end.

01:24:26.966 --> 01:24:30.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Because my big concern was
with the oncologist originally

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.510 align:middle line:10%
that we were dealing with was
how it was going to affect her

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:34.310 align:middle line:10%
development.

01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And when she started to
enter the teenage years,

01:24:37.190 --> 01:24:39.619 align:middle line:10%
starting a period, and
growing and developing,

01:24:39.619 --> 01:24:41.160 align:middle line:10%
and he just looked
at me and he said,

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.890 align:middle line:10%
well, frankly,
Mrs. Ressel, she's

01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:45.060 align:middle line:10%
not going to live that long.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:48.800 align:middle line:10%
>> What she would have to go
through in those extra months,

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.570 align:middle line:10%
that will be horrible.

01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:52.230 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't want
to go through it.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Why do it?

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:55.950 align:middle line:10%
>> You're handed the
death sentence anyway,

01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:58.790 align:middle line:10%
so what was the point
of the radiation?

01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:04.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Then, you have to say, OK,
modern medicine doesn't have

01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:05.550 align:middle line:10%
an answer.

01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:07.620 align:middle line:10%
Let's find our own.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.470 align:middle line:10%
>> When you look at what
is going on and how Dr.

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:13.650 align:middle line:10%
Burzynski is being handled,
it is clearly a function

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:17.290 align:middle line:10%
of anytime you have big
business, big government,

01:25:17.290 --> 01:25:20.670 align:middle line:10%
big labor, big pharma, big
cancer industry, whatever,

01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:24.870 align:middle line:10%
they become so wrapped up in
protecting the institution,

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:29.430 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is, that they forget
what their fundamental job is.

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:33.660 align:middle line:10%
And what's happened with
big pharma and big cancer

01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:38.170 align:middle line:10%
is they've forgotten to be
curious about that there might

01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:41.340 align:middle line:10%
be other opportunities
and options out there,

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:47.240 align:middle line:10%
and they're focused on
protecting their turf.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Due to this reality, combined
with the continued failed

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
efforts of state and federal
agencies in their attempts

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to stop Burzynski from
continuing to treat patients

01:25:57.410 --> 01:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and expand his research, special
interest groups have since

01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
launched a relentless
propaganda campaign against Dr.

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski and his supporters
and patients in hopes that this

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.830 align:middle line:84%
game-changing innovation
never reach the open market.

01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.820 align:middle line:10%
While most would assume
that a breakthrough cancer

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.060 align:middle line:10%
treatment of this magnitude
would be widely celebrated

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.060 align:middle line:10%
by the industry and
encouraged for no other reason

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.630 align:middle line:10%
than its monetary worth,
when one applies the logic

01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and reason of the scientific
method to this idea,

01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:33.240 align:middle line:10%
this theory has no
foundation or basis in fact.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The primary reason that
the cancer industry

01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and its regulatory agencies fear
the approval of antineoplastons

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:42.380 align:middle line:90%
is purely economical.

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
If antineoplastons
were FDA-approved

01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
for just one cancer type,
even the smallest and obscure

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
of cancer types, like brain
stem tumors in children, where

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
antineoplastons hold the
first cures in medical history

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
but only a afflicts a
few children per year,

01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
this would mean that
anyone of any age

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.820 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with any
type of cancer,

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.370 align:middle line:84%
like breast, lung, or
liver, could legally

01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:09.950 align:middle line:84%
insist their
oncologist provide them

01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:13.670 align:middle line:90%
with antineoplastons off label.

01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Given the gentle and nontoxic
nature of these medications,

01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
most reasonable
people would begin

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to opt for antineoplastons
as a first line of defense

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
against their cancer
instead of first choosing

01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
the outdated modalities
of toxic, life-threatening

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.220 align:middle line:90%
chemotherapy and radiation.

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Since approximately 40%
of all men and women

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.550 align:middle line:84%
will develop cancer
in their lifetimes,

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
the FDA approval of
antineoplastons on any level

01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
will reap financial devastation
to the medical industry

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and could send Wall Street
into a downward spiral.

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, since these
patented medications

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
have been in FDA clinical
testing for more than 20 years,

01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, the
patents have expired.

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But technically, they are
still partially protected

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.140 align:middle line:84%
due to being in the limbo
of FDA clinical trials.

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Once antineoplastons are
FDA-approved for market,

01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
the entity owning
their patents rights

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.170 align:middle line:84%
will only have up to seven
years of cornering the cancer

01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:18.410 align:middle line:84%
treatment market before
these medications devolve

01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:20.060 align:middle line:90%
into a generic drug.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Once they become generic,
like the antibiotic,

01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
their prices will
plummet indefinitely,

01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
allowing any global drug
company to produce and sell

01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
antineoplastons,
effectively destroying

01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the current high profit paradigm
that the cancer industry has

01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
relied on for more
than 40 years.

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:42.650 align:middle line:10%
Due to this stark reality,
special interest groups

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.990 align:middle line:10%
are making every
possible attempt

01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:48.020 align:middle line:10%
to derail the approval
of antineoplastons,

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:51.140 align:middle line:10%
demonize their inventor,
while relentlessly trying

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.680 align:middle line:10%
to confuse the public about
the truth of this story

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.310 align:middle line:10%
and the invention of
antineoplastons themselves.

01:28:58.310 --> 01:29:01.520 align:middle line:84%
The primary weapon in
this deceitful propaganda

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
is what is defined as
an Astroturf campaign.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.090 align:middle line:10%
>> What is Astroturf?

01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:12.200 align:middle line:10%
It's a perversion of grass
roots, as in fake grass roots.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.240 align:middle line:10%
Astroturf is when
political, corporate,

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.940 align:middle line:10%
or other special interests
disguise themselves,

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.540 align:middle line:10%
and publish blogs, start
Facebook and Twitter accounts,

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:22.940 align:middle line:10%
publish ads, letters
to the editor,

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:26.780 align:middle line:10%
or simply post comments
online to try to fool you

01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:29.930 align:middle line:10%
into thinking an independent
or grassroots movement is

01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:31.280 align:middle line:10%
speaking.

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:33.080 align:middle line:10%
The whole point of
Astroturf is to try

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.850 align:middle line:10%
to give the impression
there's widespread

01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:39.260 align:middle line:10%
support for or against an
agenda when there's not.

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:41.450 align:middle line:10%
Astroturf seeks
to manipulate you

01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:44.420 align:middle line:10%
into changing your opinion
by making you feel as if you

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:47.420 align:middle line:10%
are an outlier when you're not.

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:49.400 align:middle line:10%
A carefully
constructed narrative

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.740 align:middle line:10%
by unseen special
interests designed

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.630 align:middle line:10%
to manipulate your opinion.

01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:58.520 align:middle line:10%
A Truman Show-esque alternate
reality all around you.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.470 align:middle line:10%
Complacency in the
news media combined

01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:03.320 align:middle line:10%
with incredibly powerful
propaganda and publicity

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.610 align:middle line:10%
forces mean we sometimes
get little of the truth.

01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:09.950 align:middle line:10%
Special interests have
unlimited time and money

01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:13.790 align:middle line:10%
to figure out new ways to spin
us while cloaking their role.

01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:16.555 align:middle line:10%
Surreptitious Astroturf
methods are now

01:30:16.555 --> 01:30:17.930 align:middle line:10%
more important to
these interests

01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:19.940 align:middle line:10%
than traditional
lobbying of Congress.

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:23.250 align:middle line:10%
There's an entire industry
built around it in Washington.

01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:25.550 align:middle line:10%
Astroturfers seek
to controversialize

01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:27.440 align:middle line:10%
those who disagree with them.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:30.020 align:middle line:10%
They attack news organizations
that publish stories

01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:33.410 align:middle line:10%
they don't like, whistleblowers
who tell the truth,

01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:36.560 align:middle line:10%
politicians who dare to
ask the tough questions,

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.330 align:middle line:10%
and journalists who
have the audacity

01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:40.670 align:middle line:10%
to report on all of it.

01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:44.600 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, Astroturfers simply
shove intentionally so much

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:47.270 align:middle line:10%
confusing and conflicting
information into the mix,

01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:49.460 align:middle line:10%
that you're left to
throw up your hands

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:53.040 align:middle line:10%
and disregard all of
it, including the truth.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.880 align:middle line:10%
Drown out a link between a
medicine and a harmful side

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.030 align:middle line:10%
effect, say vaccines
and autism, by throwing

01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:02.600 align:middle line:10%
a bunch of conflicting paid for
studies, surveys, and experts

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:07.550 align:middle line:10%
into the mix, confusing the
truth beyond recognition.

01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:14.120 align:middle line:10%
And then there's Wikipedia,
Astroturf's dream come true.

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.260 align:middle line:10%
Billed as the free encyclopedia
that anyone can edit,

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.370 align:middle line:10%
the reality you can't
be more different.

01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:23.210 align:middle line:10%
Anonymous Wikipedia editors
control and co-opt pages

01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:25.190 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of special interests.

01:31:25.190 --> 01:31:28.520 align:middle line:10%
They forbid and reverse edits
that go against their agenda.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.820 align:middle line:10%
They skew and delete
information in blatant violation

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:35.330 align:middle line:10%
of Wikipedia's own established
policies with impunity,

01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:38.480 align:middle line:10%
always superior to the poor
schlubs who actually believe

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.460 align:middle line:10%
anyone could edit
Wikipedia, only

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.130 align:middle line:10%
to discover they're barred from
correcting even the simplest

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:45.170 align:middle line:10%
factual inaccuracies.

01:31:45.170 --> 01:31:47.510 align:middle line:10%
Try adding a footnoted
fact or correcting

01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:51.020 align:middle line:10%
a fact error on one of these
monitored Wikipedia pages,

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.660 align:middle line:10%
and poof, sometimes within
a matter of seconds,

01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:56.540 align:middle line:10%
you'll find your
edit is reversed.

01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:59.420 align:middle line:10%
In 2012, famed
author Philip Roth

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:02.180 align:middle line:10%
tried to correct a major
fact about the inspiration

01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.580 align:middle line:10%
behind one of his
book characters

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.840 align:middle line:10%
cited on a Wikipedia page.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.990 align:middle line:10%
But no matter how hard he
tried, Wikipedia's editors

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.220 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't allow it.

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:13.960 align:middle line:10%
They kept reverting the edits
back to the false information.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.520 align:middle line:10%
When Roth finally
reached a person

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.800 align:middle line:10%
at Wikipedia, which
was no easy task,

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.870 align:middle line:10%
and tried to find out
what was going wrong,

01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:23.075 align:middle line:10%
they told him he simply was not
considered a credible source

01:32:23.075 --> 01:32:23.875 align:middle line:10%
on himself.

01:32:23.875 --> 01:32:26.710 align:middle line:10%


01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:29.110 align:middle line:10%
A few weeks later, there
was a huge scandal when

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:32.770 align:middle line:10%
Wikipedia officials got
caught offering a PR service,

01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:35.050 align:middle line:10%
the skewed and edited
information on behalf of

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:38.350 align:middle line:10%
paid, publicity seeking
clients in utter opposition

01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:40.990 align:middle line:10%
to Wikipedia's suppose policies.

01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:44.170 align:middle line:10%
All of this may be why,
when a medical study looked

01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:47.500 align:middle line:10%
at medical conditions
described in Wikipedia pages

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:50.290 align:middle line:10%
and compared it to actual
peer-reviewed published

01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:54.910 align:middle line:10%
research, Wikipedia contradicted
medical research 90%

01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:56.810 align:middle line:10%
of the time.

01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:59.770 align:middle line:10%
You may never fully trust what
you read on Wikipedia again,

01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:01.720 align:middle line:10%
nor should you.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:05.200 align:middle line:10%
>> This anti-Burzynski
propaganda campaign began

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:08.890 align:middle line:10%
in November of 2011
with ScienceBlogs,

01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:11.680 align:middle line:10%
which nearly went under after
accepting paid propaganda

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.030 align:middle line:10%
messages masked as editorials
by corporate giant PepsiCo,

01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:18.170 align:middle line:10%
as well as
science-based medicine,

01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:21.550 align:middle line:10%
which in turn spawned the
website "The Houston Cancer

01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:25.380 align:middle line:10%
Quack," under the guise of an
AstroTurf organization called

01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:28.420 align:middle line:10%
"The Skeptics for the
Protection of Cancer Patients."

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.580 align:middle line:10%
After this bogus
group was established,

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:33.430 align:middle line:10%
they opened Facebook
pages, Twitter accounts,

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:36.310 align:middle line:10%
blog incessantly,
start petitions,

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:39.580 align:middle line:10%
even comparing Burzynski's
FDA sanctions activities

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.250 align:middle line:10%
to the infamous Tuskegee
experiment, where

01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:44.260 align:middle line:10%
doctors intentionally
gave scores

01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:45.910 align:middle line:10%
of African-Americans syphilis.

01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:48.040 align:middle line:10%
This group also
launched a grossly

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.630 align:middle line:10%
deceiving and
manipulative website

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:51.940 align:middle line:10%
called "The OTHER
Burzynski Patient

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:55.870 align:middle line:10%
Group," which consists of a list
of unconfirmed former patients

01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:58.180 align:middle line:10%
allegedly treated by
Burzynski organization

01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.430 align:middle line:10%
who allegedly died
under its care,

01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:03.520 align:middle line:10%
without providing the
unsuspecting reader full names

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.630 align:middle line:10%
or sources.

01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:08.170 align:middle line:10%
This effort was created to
usurp a legitimate organization

01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:11.170 align:middle line:10%
called The Burzynski Patient
Group, which has been

01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:13.390 align:middle line:10%
in existence since the 1990s.

01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:17.140 align:middle line:10%
This group also bombards the
FDA and the Texas Medical

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:20.230 align:middle line:10%
Board with petitions,
e-mails, and phone calls

01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:24.370 align:middle line:10%
accusing those agencies of not
doing their job in stopping

01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:27.370 align:middle line:10%
the Burzynski Clinic and the
Burzynski Research Institute

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.960 align:middle line:10%
from continuing to operate.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.060 align:middle line:10%
This group has also
managed to fool

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:33.250 align:middle line:10%
unsuspecting members of
the mainstream press,

01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:35.920 align:middle line:10%
like Liz Szabo of "USA Today."

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.440 align:middle line:10%
After they assembled all of
these propaganda components

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:42.490 align:middle line:10%
on their chessboard, they then
deleted the Stanislaw Burzynski

01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:44.950 align:middle line:10%
and antineoplastons
Wikipedia pages

01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:48.520 align:middle line:10%
and consolidated them into
a single Burzynski Clinic

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.920 align:middle line:10%
Wikipedia page that
they exclusively

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.110 align:middle line:10%
control by linking
to the articles

01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:55.300 align:middle line:10%
by members of the press
they've manipulated,

01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:59.620 align:middle line:10%
linking to their own blog posts,
while also leaving commentary

01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:03.530 align:middle line:10%
on PubMed pretending to be
medical experts and reviewers,

01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:07.150 align:middle line:10%
and then deviously use their
own fraudulent medical review

01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:11.410 align:middle line:10%
commentary as Wikipedia sources
to give the illusion that there

01:35:11.410 --> 01:35:13.630 align:middle line:10%
is overwhelming
opposition to the safety

01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:15.850 align:middle line:10%
and efficacy of antineoplastons.

01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:18.640 align:middle line:10%
This group has also
infiltrated and manipulated

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.270 align:middle line:10%
a global group that calls
themselves "The Skeptics,"

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:24.670 align:middle line:10%
a group that ironically
promotes critical thinking

01:35:24.670 --> 01:35:26.080 align:middle line:10%
and the scientific method.

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.670 align:middle line:10%
The following is
what happens when

01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:30.580 align:middle line:10%
an unsuspecting,
card-carrying skeptic who's

01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:33.490 align:middle line:10%
had the wool pulled over his
eyes by this devious group,

01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:35.560 align:middle line:10%
is confronted with fact.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.065 align:middle line:84%
>> And this has been going on
for 35 years with no published

01:35:39.065 --> 01:35:39.865 align:middle line:90%
results--

01:35:39.865 --> 01:35:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's absolutely untrue.

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> In a peer-reviewed journal.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>> That is absolutely untrue.

01:35:46.110 --> 01:35:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You guys, because
you haven't read it,

01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:50.725 align:middle line:84%
you take the position
that it doesn't exist.

01:35:50.725 --> 01:35:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Where have those--

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's meet for lunch one day.

01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I'll pay.

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll buy you lunch.

01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll bring you all of
the published peer-reviewed

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.263 align:middle line:90%
clinical data.

01:36:01.263 --> 01:36:02.346 align:middle line:90%
>> I would love to see it.

01:36:02.346 --> 01:36:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:04.103 align:middle line:90%
>> I would love to see it.

01:36:04.103 --> 01:36:06.104 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, from
where I'm coming from,

01:36:06.104 --> 01:36:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I've done a lot of research.

01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found
anything other than--

01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did you
do your research?

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.471 align:middle line:90%
Where did you do your research?

01:36:11.471 --> 01:36:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>> You can look on Medline.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.450 align:middle line:90%
You can look on PubMed.

01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:15.250 align:middle line:90%
You can search.

01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:16.624 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
search Burzynski.

01:36:16.624 --> 01:36:17.964 align:middle line:90%
You can search antineoplastons.

01:36:17.964 --> 01:36:32.740 align:middle line:90%


01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever have you
ever talked to Dr. Burzynski?

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever been to Houston?

01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever gone
to the clinic?

01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you say that it would
be a much more effective way,

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and a much better way of getting
at the truth of what's going on

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.830 align:middle line:90%
if you go and talk to him?

01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I haven't talked
to every single person

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:51.889 align:middle line:84%
in the world who I've
ever heard something

01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:55.137 align:middle line:84%
that I have researched
and found to be false.

01:36:55.137 --> 01:36:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't necessarily
believe in unicorns.

01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been contacted by
numerous people, if not dozens,

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:05.110 align:middle line:84%
at this point of a lot of people
that have been personally hurt

01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:06.519 align:middle line:90%
by what you guys are doing.

01:37:06.519 --> 01:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing I could
tell you for certain--

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm telling you
now, it's not right.

01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You're not doing a
morally good thing,

01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:14.320 align:middle line:90%
and you're hurting people.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And people may die as a
result of what you're doing.

01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And you think you're saving
people, but you're not.

01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:22.960 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is what happens
when a legitimate member

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.590 align:middle line:10%
of the skeptic community
finds out what these Astroturf

01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:30.550 align:middle line:10%
imposters have maliciously
done in their name.

01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:33.144 align:middle line:10%
>> This film was great.

01:37:33.144 --> 01:37:36.010 align:middle line:10%
I don't have a question, but
I think that one of the people

01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:38.150 align:middle line:10%
can respond.

01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:41.320 align:middle line:10%
I happen to be the head
Skeptic in Orange County,

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.140 align:middle line:10%
and I think that this
film negatively reflects

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.120 align:middle line:10%
what Skeptics are all about.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.070 align:middle line:10%
I agree with everything in this
film because it's been tested.

01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:54.370 align:middle line:10%
It's been tested in
different countries.

01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:56.770 align:middle line:10%
So I want you to respond on--

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.530 align:middle line:10%
I know that there
was a Skeptic that

01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:02.110 align:middle line:10%
was introduced in your film,
which I am appalled by,

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:04.296 align:middle line:10%
being a Skeptic myself.

01:38:04.296 --> 01:38:05.846 align:middle line:10%
I operate on promoting science.

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:10.040 align:middle line:10%
I have Skeptics' groups, and I
have over one thousand people

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.780 align:middle line:10%
in my group in Orange County.

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:14.487 align:middle line:10%
And I think that I am going
recommend this movie to all

01:38:14.487 --> 01:38:15.421 align:middle line:10%
them.

01:38:15.421 --> 01:38:18.280 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> History hasn't changed much.

01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Scientific fact continues
to be often based

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.020 align:middle line:84%
not on science or peer
review, but the projected

01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:31.231 align:middle line:84%
illusion and manufacturing of
a perceived majority consensus.

01:38:31.231 --> 01:38:32.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, in surprise and alarm.

01:38:32.691 --> 01:38:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh you mean sort of--

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah!

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:38.340 align:middle line:90%


01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Otherwise known
as pseudoscience,

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:47.050 align:middle line:10%
the very idea this opposition
vehemently pretends to oppose.

01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:49.140 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's August 26, 2015.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:49.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The last time I saw
you guys was in 2012.

01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We've definitely
come a long way.

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:59.190 align:middle line:90%
We got married last year, so.

01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.910 align:middle line:90%
And that wasn't something that--

01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> That we ever
thought we'd be doing.

01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I never thought
I'd get married, first off.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.810 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, with
what happened to Hannah

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and her prognosis, that
looked like it would never

01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:12.490 align:middle line:90%
happen either.

01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a miracle, you know?

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And we've just done
everything we can

01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:18.310 align:middle line:90%
to get on and enjoy our life.

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:20.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

01:39:20.848 --> 01:39:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And Dr. Burzynsk's
treatment saved her life.

01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:26.520 align:middle line:10%
People can think what
they want, you know,

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:31.660 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of people
think that Dr. Burzynski is,

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:34.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, a fraud, a
charlatan, a crook, or whatever

01:39:34.330 --> 01:39:35.830 align:middle line:10%
they want to think.

01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:37.360 align:middle line:10%
One thing in life,
you should always

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.640 align:middle line:10%
try and respect the beliefs
that other people have.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's very hard to
respect the beliefs of people

01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
who really want to see this
guy just cleared out, stamped

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.030 align:middle line:84%
out, killed, or not
killed but, you know,

01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:50.740 align:middle line:90%
professionally killed.

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:54.396 align:middle line:84%
What I've seen along the way--
because I've kind of kept

01:39:54.396 --> 01:39:56.020 align:middle line:84%
all of this away from
her, and I didn't

01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:59.590 align:middle line:84%
want her to see how much
hatred there is for this guy.

01:39:59.590 --> 01:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know he's
being taken again

01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:04.690 align:middle line:84%
by the Texas Medical Board,
what, for the third time.

01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Twice by the FDA.

01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:07.406 align:middle line:90%
When's it ever going to stop?

01:40:07.406 --> 01:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But I remember Dr. Burzynski
saying something to me.

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, why do you
keep doing this?

01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:12.750 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:14.105 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I have to.

01:40:14.105 --> 01:40:14.980 align:middle line:90%
I have to keep going.

01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:17.396 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I probably won't
get recognized for this work

01:40:17.396 --> 01:40:18.820 align:middle line:90%
until I'm dead.

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there
isn't a day goes

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:26.250 align:middle line:84%
by when I don't think
how lucky we are,

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:30.640 align:middle line:84%
about how it scares the
crap outta me that there

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.090 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of people who might
never get this treatment,

01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of people who are

01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:40.210 align:middle line:84%
convinced absolutely 100% that
this treatment doesn't work.

01:40:40.210 --> 01:40:42.730 align:middle line:84%
She was accepted on a
Phase II clinical trial.

01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:43.840 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And she's trying to get on with
her life as best as she can.

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for me, it's a
little bit different,

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:54.430 align:middle line:84%
because I feel a
massive debt to him.

01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And I get contacted probably
every two or three weeks

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:02.800 align:middle line:84%
by someone with a brain tumor
asking me for help and advice.

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And we want to say thank
you, obviously, to you,

01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Eric, because if you
hadn't have made this film,

01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I probably never would have
found out about the treatment.

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.440 align:middle line:10%
I want to say a massive thank
you to Dr. Burzynski, and all

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.020 align:middle line:10%
of the people in his
clinic because they went

01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:20.360 align:middle line:10%
to great lengths to help us.

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.630 align:middle line:84%
This treatment didn't
work for everyone,

01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:24.460 align:middle line:84%
but it definitely
worked for some people.

01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.440 align:middle line:84%
We spent seven weeks
at that clinic.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Daddy.

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, how are you?

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:31.524 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I'm sorry
for ringing so late.

01:41:31.524 --> 01:41:33.070 align:middle line:10%
>> That's all right.

01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:36.140 align:middle line:10%
>> But I'm ringing with
really, really good news.

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:36.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Good.

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.588 align:middle line:10%
That's what I want to hear.

01:41:38.588 --> 01:41:39.388 align:middle line:10%
>> Go on.

01:41:39.388 --> 01:41:39.520 align:middle line:10%
You tell.

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.780 align:middle line:10%
>> No, you tell him.

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:43.086 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't think I can.

01:41:43.086 --> 01:41:45.684 align:middle line:10%
>> Just tell me.

01:41:45.684 --> 01:41:47.172 align:middle line:10%
Come on.

01:41:47.172 --> 01:41:51.685 align:middle line:10%
>> My tumor has
already shrunk by 10%.

01:41:51.685 --> 01:41:54.410 align:middle line:10%


01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:55.575 align:middle line:10%
>> Fucking hell, man.

01:41:55.575 --> 01:41:58.761 align:middle line:90%


01:41:58.761 --> 01:42:02.820 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely amazing.

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I tried to talk
to some of these people,

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
some of the other doctors,
none of the doctors who treated

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Hannah, the oncologists,
none of them are interested

01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:12.300 align:middle line:90%
in the fact--

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.010 align:middle line:84%
five years, she's
nearly now five years.

01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Which means what?

01:42:15.810 --> 01:42:18.270 align:middle line:84%
In cancer treatment, that
means you're cured, right?

01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Thinking, you may die.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, but it's
just such a crazy world.

01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:25.410 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Such a crazy world,
because there

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.690 align:middle line:84%
are people out there all over
the world who could really--

01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:32.600 align:middle line:84%
this treatment could
save their lives,

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.475 align:middle line:84%
and they'll probably
never ever ever get it.

01:42:34.475 --> 01:42:36.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, the other thing
is, which a lot of people

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:40.630 align:middle line:84%
don't know, this Japanese
paper, this Japanese data

01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:44.550 align:middle line:84%
was a Phase II independent
randomized trial.

01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:46.870 align:middle line:10%
And that's what so many
people wanted to see.

01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:48.710 align:middle line:10%
But it's just so easy
to say, oh, no, no.

01:42:48.710 --> 01:42:49.640 align:middle line:10%
Push it away.

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:50.440 align:middle line:10%
Push it away.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.449 align:middle line:10%
But because the study
wasn't very big,

01:42:52.449 --> 01:42:54.240 align:middle line:10%
and they put the words
in it that basically

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.160 align:middle line:10%
say it wasn't a
big enough number,

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.270 align:middle line:10%
people just disregard it.

01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:58.740 align:middle line:90%
It's like toilet paper.

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd love to see it
all over and done with.

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:01.720 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:03.885 align:middle line:90%
The drug approved.

01:43:03.885 --> 01:43:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Just him--

01:43:07.190 --> 01:43:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Him getting the
recognition that he deserves.

01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, hopefully there
will be a third movie.

01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there will be a
happy ending to this,

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.612 align:middle line:90%
that this drug gets approved.

01:43:15.612 --> 01:43:20.980 align:middle line:90%


01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Two years ago, we finished
our Phase II clinical trial

01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:26.410 align:middle line:90%
problem.

01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:29.860 align:middle line:84%
We finished successfully
14 Phase II clinical trials

01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:34.750 align:middle line:84%
under FDA supervision,
which proved not only

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:37.080 align:middle line:84%
increased the response
rate according

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to the protocol, which means
there was a proof of efficacy

01:43:41.110 --> 01:43:43.690 align:middle line:84%
coming from Phase
II clinical trials,

01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and the proof that the
treatment is well-tolerated.

01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So basically, after we finished
clinical trial program here

01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:55.720 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, and
after our Japanese colleagues

01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.000 align:middle line:84%
reported exciting data in the
treatment of colorectal cancer,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.740 align:middle line:84%
which spread to the liver by
randomized controlled clinical

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:08.585 align:middle line:84%
trials, which shows
doubling long-term survival

01:44:08.585 --> 01:44:11.530 align:middle line:84%
in such patients,
we found ourselves

01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:16.450 align:middle line:84%
under horrible harassment
by the regulatory agencies

01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and by people who are
hired by our adversaries.

01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Then the last stage of quote,
unquote "war" against us

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.090 align:middle line:90%
started.

01:44:28.090 --> 01:44:33.070 align:middle line:84%
We are exposed to one of
the longest in the history

01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:37.590 align:middle line:84%
inspection by the FDA, which
lasted almost three months.

01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Then after we are able to sort
out the issues with the FDA,

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and FDA gave us green
light to proceed

01:44:47.710 --> 01:44:51.310 align:middle line:84%
with additional clinical
trials and move forward

01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:54.400 align:middle line:84%
with the approval
process, we are furiously

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:58.570 align:middle line:84%
attacked by Texas
Medical Board based

01:44:58.570 --> 01:45:00.670 align:middle line:90%
on some frivolous charges.

01:45:00.670 --> 01:45:05.380 align:middle line:84%
We had ordered by Internal
Revenue Service, or IRS.

01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We have also submitted to audit
by Securities and Exchange

01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And these things, obviously,
we have nothing against.

01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But it cost a lot of time,
and it cost a lot of money

01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:23.330 align:middle line:84%
to get out of this, except
for Texas Medical Board, which

01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:25.600 align:middle line:84%
continued to harass
us, and clearly would

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.410 align:middle line:84%
like to destroy our clinic, they
would like to close our clinic.

01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:34.000 align:middle line:10%
Started litigation
of me personally,

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.430 align:middle line:10%
and oncologist and
the other doctors

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:38.570 align:middle line:10%
who are working for our clinic.

01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:43.300 align:middle line:10%
Simply, their action is aimed
to destroy our activities.

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And they would to harass--

01:45:44.590 --> 01:45:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to do it quickly,
because they realize

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:49.240 align:middle line:84%
that we are very close
to a final approval

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.350 align:middle line:90%
of our medication.

01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:53.100 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, they don't
want to have cure of cancer.

01:45:53.100 --> 01:46:14.710 align:middle line:90%


01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like a cancer
industrial complex now.

01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:19.422 align:middle line:90%
And it just is heart wrenching.

01:46:19.422 --> 01:46:21.921 align:middle line:10%
>> I think most people think
that they're just going to wake

01:46:21.921 --> 01:46:24.730 align:middle line:10%
up one morning and find a
headline in the newspaper, hey,

01:46:24.730 --> 01:46:26.067 align:middle line:10%
we just found a cure for cancer.

01:46:26.067 --> 01:46:28.150 align:middle line:84%
That it's something that
is going to be discovered

01:46:28.150 --> 01:46:29.740 align:middle line:90%
by the pharmaceutical industry.

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:32.145 align:middle line:84%
And it's obvious to me
after watching the Burzynski

01:46:32.145 --> 01:46:33.520 align:middle line:84%
first film and
doing the research

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that I've done that there are
alternative therapies that

01:46:36.130 --> 01:46:40.030 align:middle line:84%
already exist that are
doing positive things.

01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And then when we have
government institutions that

01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.820 align:middle line:84%
use taxpayer dollars
that try to fight back

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:48.140 align:middle line:84%
against this good that's
happening, it's mind blowing.

01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I can't sit back and
allow that to happen.

01:46:50.530 --> 01:46:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I was told I
had a fatal cancer,

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and that they would treat
me for a while with chemo

01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:01.115 align:middle line:84%
and radiation, but eventually,
I would die of the disease.

01:47:01.115 --> 01:47:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you die from the disease?

01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm here today, and I'm healthy
and happy, and so grateful

01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:09.910 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Burzynski.

01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:11.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Burzynski saved my life.

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you believe you would be
alive without Dr. Burzynski?

01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:16.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I know I would not be.

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:18.310 align:middle line:10%
>> But he's fighting the
good fight, I believe,

01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:19.720 align:middle line:10%
for a very good reason.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.940 align:middle line:10%
To me, that's the definition
of what a hero is.

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:24.260 align:middle line:10%
So, of course, I'm going to
come out today and support

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.630 align:middle line:10%
that hero, for sure.

01:47:25.630 --> 01:47:30.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's a travesty that
a man is basically bound by his

01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:34.660 align:middle line:10%
own Hippocratic oath to look
after the patients is now being

01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:39.280 align:middle line:10%
tried for doing what
he was supposed to do.

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.340 align:middle line:10%
And it calls for a lot of
people to stand up against this.

01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very sad, I
think, for me personally.

01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of people are
unaware of how bad this really

01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.830 align:middle line:90%
is.

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that unless
we all stand up,

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:56.020 align:middle line:84%
things aren't going
to get any better.

01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And it really puts the onus
back on us as a people.

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:00.910 align:middle line:10%
Like, we've got
doctors that have

01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:03.730 align:middle line:10%
gone out and put their
lives, their families,

01:48:03.730 --> 01:48:05.910 align:middle line:10%
their careers on the line.

01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:08.140 align:middle line:10%
And Burzynski is one of
the best examples you

01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:10.110 align:middle line:10%
can find in the world of that.

01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:16.240 align:middle line:10%
And we as a people have to
stand for these doctors that

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:19.270 align:middle line:10%
need our support, that need
a voice to stand for them

01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:24.220 align:middle line:10%
and say, the truth is,
and to be bold about it.

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe they should
be exposed to some type

01:48:26.590 --> 01:48:29.980 align:middle line:84%
of investigation to find
out why they did it,

01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and why they purposely, blindly
follow the orders of the people

01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:38.350 align:middle line:84%
who are behind, and who
tell them to destroy us.

01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:41.890 align:middle line:10%
This is something which
is a complete nonsense,

01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:44.680 align:middle line:10%
and which America
should investigate

01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:46.870 align:middle line:10%
because it should not happen.

01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, this
will be explained,

01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be relieved
from this madness, which

01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:55.090 align:middle line:84%
is really hurting us
and hurting patients.

01:48:55.090 --> 01:48:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm here, first
of all, because Dr.

01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Burzynski saved my life.

01:48:59.590 --> 01:49:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And also, I believe
that people have a right

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.550 align:middle line:84%
to choose whatever
it is they want

01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:05.920 align:middle line:90%
to do for their medical health.

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.724 align:middle line:10%
And that's our freedom
in this country.

01:49:09.724 --> 01:49:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'm mainly
here because I feel

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:15.370 align:middle line:84%
like I owe Dr. Burzynski to
show people that what he does

01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:17.560 align:middle line:90%
is not quackery.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I was given two months
to live, and here I

01:49:20.290 --> 01:49:24.122 align:middle line:84%
am seven years later,
and I'm totally fine.

01:49:24.122 --> 01:49:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> What type of cancer?

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Breast.

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.350 align:middle line:90%
I experienced breast cancer.

01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But I no longer experience any
cancer in my body whatsoever.

01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:34.320 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, my wife was dying.

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.260 align:middle line:10%
We went to Texas Oncology.

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:39.530 align:middle line:10%
They told her make time to die.

01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:43.850 align:middle line:84%
You have 60 days to live, or
we can give you serious chemo,

01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you'll live
one to two years.

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we said, no,
we're not accepting that.

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:51.770 align:middle line:84%
We looked around, and
we found Dr. Burzynski.

01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:53.750 align:middle line:10%
We went in, and he
gave us some hope.

01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:57.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm not sure, but I
think we can turn this around.

01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And in 60 days, the cancer
that was in her lungs

01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:06.200 align:middle line:90%
and in her sternum, it was gone.

01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.060 align:middle line:10%
Just disappeared.

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:11.640 align:middle line:10%
If you'd have seen the
x-ray she had on her lungs,

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:14.630 align:middle line:10%
it was totally white.

01:50:14.630 --> 01:50:18.060 align:middle line:84%
60 days later we did
another x-ray, gone.

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.720 align:middle line:90%


01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And what he discussed with us,
it just made perfect sense ,

01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:30.480 align:middle line:84%
that if you're not working for
the FDA or the drug companies,

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:32.650 align:middle line:90%
there's a way to cure cancer.

01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm 25 years old at
the end of the month,

01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and there's been a cure
for cancer that long.

01:50:38.250 --> 01:50:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Plain and simple.

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:48.235 align:middle line:90%
