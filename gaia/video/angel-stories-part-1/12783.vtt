00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:17.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:84%
SCOTT DEGENHART: I was
awakened by this Spirit that

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:84%
zoomed right over from my
feet, over the top of me,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and hovered on the left side
of my bed at my shoulders.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of a
glowing, misty cloud

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:90%
is the best way to describe it.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.895 align:middle line:84%
RAYMOND BOWMAN: And
out of the light

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:90%
a voice said to me, "Fear not.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.484 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes God has to take the
best flower in the garden."

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
JOAN WESTER ANDERSON:
32 degrees below

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
zero the middle of the
night, and they just

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
sat on the side of
the road with no place

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to run, no lights
in the distance,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.338 align:middle line:84%
and realized they were probably
going to freeze to death.

00:00:56.338 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
DONALD SPANN: One of
the fears I've had

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:90%
is drowning all my life.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about my
family, my wife, my children,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.170 align:middle line:84%
how they were going to take this
news that I was lost at sea.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
JOCELYN: I was crying,
and she was crying.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
We're both really scared,
and to try to keep ourselves

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
from going too crazy
or from freaking out,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:90%
we started praying.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And we started
singing praise songs.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:44.297 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It's my angel.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why I haven't been
afraid the last few minutes.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
My guardian angel
came to help me.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER): They
are endless, these stories

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of unexplained rescues,
of spiritual beings

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:90%
that appear in times of need.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
These heroes that
offer their aid, then

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:90%
mysteriously disappear.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
These miracle happenings
are part of every culture

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth, in every
recorded span of history.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's likely that you
have such a story hanging out

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
there somewhere in
your memory, something

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:84%
strange and unexplainable
happened, from an intuition

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that came at just
the right moment,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
to a strange coincidence that
changed the path of your life

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:90%
to a stunning miracle.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:90%
You know it happened.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But how?
Why?

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
My name is Pam Kidd, a regular
name, a regular person, a wife,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
a mom, someone's
daughter, someone's

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:90%
neighbor, someone's friend.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I write magazine
articles for a living.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
One day I told my editor
about an unusual thing that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
had happened to me,
which I believed

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:90%
to be an angelic encounter.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
It led to a research
assignment in which I spoke

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
to many people who
claimed to have had

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:90%
an experience with an angel.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
My story begins as a mystery
of sorts, an event that took

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:90%
place the night my father died.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Three years passed
before this mystery,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
this unexplained happening
was finally solved.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
When the solution came,
it completely changed

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
my understanding of
things seen, as well

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
as things that we
cannot see in this

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:90%
strange and wonderful world.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:90%
This is my story.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
In it, you'll probably
discover a story of your own.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
My husband, David, first heard
the news over the telephone

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
from a coroner in the
town where my father died.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Within hours, we
were at my parents'

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.605 align:middle line:90%
home in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

00:04:02.605 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:84%
We were literally
numb with grief.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
After hours of sitting
with my mother,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing else
left to do But go to bed.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Exhausted, both David and
I fell into a deep sleep.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:84%
During the night I
awoke with a start.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Someone was in the room.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:90%
I was sure of it.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I was frightened, but
as quietly as I could,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I turned my head
toward the place

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
where I knew the
intruder was standing.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I could see nothing
but darkness, yet, I

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:90%
noticed something.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I smelled flowers,
wonderful flowers,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
heavy with the
sweetness of roses.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And then the presence was gone.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I slipped out of bed,
went to my mother's room

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:90%
and told her what had happened.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to discover
the source of the visitor

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
with the flowers just
as much as I did.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
We searched every
room in the house.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
No where could we find even a
hint to the smell of flowers.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
For some unexplainable
reason through

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the next difficult days,
I was surrounded with

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:90%
this strange sense of peace.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Somehow the visiting
with the flowers

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
had brought me a
very clear message.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:90%
I was not alone.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.223 align:middle line:84%
I thought of the incident often
over the next years wondering,

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:90%
but still no explanation came.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Then, out of the blue,
an old Mexican man

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
who served as our guide as we
visited Mexico City was sharing

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the history of an ornate
angel figure we had

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:90%
just admired inside a church.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.586 align:middle line:84%
And of course you know, I
remember hearing him say,

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
when angels visit
the Earth, they

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
sometimes announce
their presence

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:90%
with the smell of flowers.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:90%
When angels visit.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get the
thought out of my mind.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Back home I read
everything about angels

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:90%
that I could get my hands on.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:10%
Joan Wester Anderson, author
of "Where Angels Walk,"

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:10%
began her own research after
personally experiencing

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:10%
a supernatural rescue.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Being a person who
was strongly spiritual,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:90%
I had no bias against angels.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
It was just that I never
really thought of them

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
as getting involved
in Earth to the extent

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:90%
that I later learned they do.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a
nice thought, but not

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:90%
anything specific to me.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I felt if you're going to
pray, you just go right to God.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't need all
the rest of this stuff

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:90%
kind of hanging around.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And then my son, Tim, who at
the time was 21 years old,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
had an experience that kind
of changed all that for me.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
He was coming from
Connecticut to Chicago

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:90%
to be with us at Christmas.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, my husband
had called the boys a few days

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
before the journey
began to say, don't

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:84%
come because the
Midwest is going

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
through this terrible
temperature drop.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
The interstates
were being closed

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
because this high wind
was blowing the snow,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:90%
and it was very dangerous.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
kids kind of laughed,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.235 align:middle line:84%
well, weather warnings
are for old people.

00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:27.645 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're 21 years
old, were invincible,

00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle line:84%
we can get through the mountains
with no problem at all.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
proceeded to do,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
except they broke down
outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
on one of these
deserted access roads.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
32 degrees below zero,
the middle of the night,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and they just sat on the side
of the road with no place

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to run, no lights
in the distance,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and realized they were probably
going to freeze to death.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
as Tim described it to me,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:90%
there was a tow truck there.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:84%
They saw this flare
of light behind them.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:90%
They hadn't seen this approach.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:90%
It was just there.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The guy got out, he didn't seem
real surprised to see them.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
He hitched them up kind
of without talking much,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
took them to a place of
safety in Fort Wayne.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And when they got out of
the car and turned around

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
to ask him how much
the bill would be,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:90%
there was no truck there.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And there were no tracks
in the snow leading

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:90%
away from where the boys stood.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Now when Tim told me that, I
got goosebumps, and I said Tim,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I need to know what
time that man came.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And Tim said, well,
that I know for sure.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
He came at a quarter
to 2:00 AM, because I

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.204 align:middle line:90%
just looked at my watch.

00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, at a quarter
to 1:00, I had

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:84%
been standing by the
front window saying, God,

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:90%
you've got to send someone.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.811 align:middle line:84%
You have to send someone
to help the kids.

00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
It's Christmas.
God, you've got to send someone.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't normally
give God orders,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
but I was just doing it
then with such intensity.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
That was a quarter to 1:00
and, of course, Tim was

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:90%
still on Eastern Standard Time.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was left with
the-- the realization

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that at the very
moment I had said,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
God, you have to send
someone, God did.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:90%
But who had sent?

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And as a journalist, I
knew the ways to research.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I went
back on the trail,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and I had called the
Highway Patrol, no, they

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:90%
had had no rescue vehicles out.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.230 align:middle line:84%
That was before the
days of cellular phones,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and so they would not have
allowed any of their people

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
to cruise the
roads, because they

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:90%
could've gotten in trouble.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I called several tow truck
services, they laughed at me.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.495 align:middle line:84%
Why would a driver be
leaving the safety of town

00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
on a bitterly cold
and dangerous night?

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:90%
No, they had had no calls.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So the trail dried up
as I should have known

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that it would,
because angels don't

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:90%
leave very many calling cards.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:02.214 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER):
The more I read,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and the more I
researched, the more I

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
discovered similar
accounts of people

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
who were convinced
that angels had come

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:90%
to them in their time of need.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Proof that angels exist?

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Hardly.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Comforting?

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:26.655 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that in my own
case, someone came into my room

00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
the night my father died
and brought flowers,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:84%
not only to sooth my soul,
but to convince me that I

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:90%
was not alone in my grief.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And over and over, I heard
stories of people whose

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
angelic encounters
were accompanied

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:90%
by the fragrance of flowers.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
JOHN RONNOR: Well, this reminds
me of a story of a Mississippi

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:84%
woman who was befriended
as a sickly child

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
by a loving uncle who later
made himself known years

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
after his death to
her by overpowering

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
her house with the fragrance
of magnolia blossoms, which he

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.330 align:middle line:90%
had brought to her as a child.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:90%
TEDDY BART: We are back.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to a special
"Beyond Reason" program today.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
talking about the subject

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that people are fascinated
with all over the world.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The subject today is Angels, our
guest, John Ronnor, the author

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of "Do You Have a
Guardian Angel?"

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to see you again.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's nice to be back,
Teddy, real pleasure.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:10%
TEDDY BART: Have you
investigated-- I mean,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:10%
if somebody calls you and
says, my car was stranded,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:10%
there was nobody
around to help me.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden somebody
showed up driving a tow truck.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you
investigate to find

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:90%
out if this wasn't the AAA?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:84%
JOHN RONNOR: I do follow
up on stories, right.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, it is difficult
to nail the story down,

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because in some cases you
have a subjective experience

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:90%
on the part of one person.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes there is
circumstantial evidence.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's multiple
witnesses to an event.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
This could give rise
to some suspicion

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.084 align:middle line:84%
that this was more
than just subjectivity.

00:11:56.084 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:84%
TEDDY BART: Let's
go to the phones.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.434 align:middle line:84%
Mary Ellen, hi, you're
on "Beyond Reason."

00:11:59.434 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:90%
MARY ELLEN (ON PHONE): Hi.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.463 align:middle line:84%
MARY ELLEN (ON PHONE):
I'm fine, thanks.

00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:03.335 align:middle line:90%
Nice to talk to you.

00:12:03.335 --> 00:12:04.435 align:middle line:84%
MARY ELLEN (ON
PHONE): Thank you.

00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your
angel encounter.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
MARY ELLEN (ON PHONE):
Well, this happened

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:90%
when my son was an infant.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking him
in his baby carriage,

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and I came to a corner
on a busy street.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was letting the
carriage down onto the road,

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:90%
because there was a curb there.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a voice, a
very commanding voice,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
tell me, put the carriage back
on the sidewalk, which I did.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hesitate,
it startled me so.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I got him back
up on the sidewalk,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I stepped back a little
bit and immediately

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
a trailer truck turned down
the street that I was crossing.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.885 align:middle line:90%
And I hadn't seen the truck.

00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
He was going too fast, and
he cut the corner so sharp

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that his wheels came
up right over the curb,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.703 align:middle line:84%
and just missed me
and the baby carriage.

00:12:56.703 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was so startled that I
watched this thing happening.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:90%
It was sort of surreal.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around to
see who had said to me,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
"put the carriage back,"
and there was nobody there.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So needless to say,
I was a bit shook up.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think at the
moment that it was an angel,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:84%
but I felt it was something
certainly unusual.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
TEDDY BART: That's
a lovely story.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.990 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE RADIO HOST: That's
a remarkable story.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious,
Mary Ellen, has

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:90%
your life changed from that?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Have you gone back
to your normal life?

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Did it affect you in any
way from that point on?

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:84%
MARY ELLEN (ON PHONE):
I felt for an instant,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:90%
I thought how mortal we are.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:84%
How quickly something
can happen to just,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:90%
you know, end your life.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that it did or me,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:84%
is as I went through other
crisis later in my life,

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I really believe it gave
me a little more strength

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:84%
to believe that a miracle can
happen, or things can work out.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
TEDDY BART: Thank you
for telling your story.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
MARY ELLEN (ON
PHONE): Your welcome.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.072 align:middle line:84%
TEDDY BART: It's beautiful.
Bye, bye.

00:13:57.072 --> 00:14:01.221 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER):
As I read more

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and more of these angel stories,
something else happened.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
All those loose
ends from my past,

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and you probably know
what I'm talking about,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:84%
those events that neither you
nor I can find an explanation

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:84%
for, so we file them
under unbelievable luck

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
or strange coincidences,
or it was a miracle.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
All those loose ends that
have lingered over the years

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to become misfits
in our memories.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
These same kinds of experiences
kept cropping up in my research

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:90%
as universal angel stories.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
CANDACE EMERSON: It
was the spring of 1961.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I was eight or nine
years old, and I had gone

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:90%
outside to play on the carport.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:10%
And through the
winter, my parents

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:10%
had cut down a number of
trees on our property,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:10%
and had stacked the
wood on our carport

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:10%
creating a large wood pile.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And it stood probably seven
or eight feet from the ground.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So I climbed up on
the wood pile to play.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And as I climbed up on the
wood pile, I lost my balance

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and began to fall over
backwards head first

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:90%
off the back of this wood pile.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And strong hands came
up and literally pushed

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
me back up on top of that wood
pile and kept me from falling.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I turned
around, I expected

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
to see my mother and my dad,
that they had been behind me,

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and had seen me begin to
fall, and had run to my rescue

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%
to keep me from hurting myself.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
But when I turn around,
there was no one there.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER): A
helping hand out of nowhere.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.710 align:middle line:10%
Joan Wester Anderson interviewed
a prominent businessmen

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:10%
who also received a helping hand
in his time of desperate need.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Donald Spann was
one of the people

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.095 align:middle line:84%
that wrote to me
after the publication

00:15:49.095 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:90%
of "Where Angels Walk."

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:10%
I loved it, because it
had all the elements

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:10%
of a good angel story in it.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:10%
It showed people I thought that,
no, angel experiences don't

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:10%
just happen to saints or
people who are on their knees

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They happen to ordinary people.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:90%
People who God is calling.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
And that was a call for Don.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:90%
So he fell off a boat.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
He was not wearing
a life preserver.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
He who preached safety to all of
his employees with a vengeance

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.980 align:middle line:84%
was out on a craft
without wearing

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:90%
a life preserver of his own.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:84%
He was the only
passenger in the boat.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
It was his boat, and
his driver continued

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:84%
on not realizing
that Don had fallen

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:90%
out of the back of the boat.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:10%
And if any of you listening to
me have been around the, ocean

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:10%
you know that's
serious business.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And to be 20 miles offshore in
what the depth finder that just

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
a few minutes before told me
it was about 80 feet of water,

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
you're in with fish
that are big enough

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to consider you part
of the food chain,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and I know to be
nervous about that.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a knife.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a weapon.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have anything
to help me out.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have on a pair of long
pants to cross-tie the legs

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.425 align:middle line:90%
and use for flotation.

00:17:08.425 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd been out there,
I don't know,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.354 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say 45 minutes.

00:17:12.354 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
my family, my wife,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:84%
my children, how they're
going to take this news

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:90%
that I was lost at sea.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
And when Don realized that he
was probably going to drown,

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
things he did was pray.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It's such a temptation to say,
God, if you'll just get me out

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of this jam I'm in
right now, I'll be

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:90%
a good boy the rest of my life.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I realize that's bargaining
with God, and I couldn't do it,

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
no matter if I died and
I was totally desperate.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:90%
I'd still could not bargain.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I prayed to God, if it
is Thy will, and if I'm allowed,

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
may I have your permission,
God, that I get just

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:90%
one foot on the sandy beach.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And then if I fall
over dead, that's fine,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
but please don't take me
this way if I may ask.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there was an
element that I don't find

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
in too many of the
stories, but I think

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:90%
it occurs more than we know.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was Don ran
into the darkness.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
He had a temptation
in the water.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:84%
He had a voice come that
was not a heavenly voice,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:90%
and he knew it.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, this same
voice came back the third time

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:90%
and it was angry.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a higher pitch, and
it was right in my right ear

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:90%
and echoing.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And this voice said, it
called my name again,

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and it called John T's name
for the first time, "Don,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
John T is not going
to come back,"

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that he's not going
to turn around.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that was wrong.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I knew he would at least turn
around when he missed me.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.555 align:middle line:84%
He would not go on
to Fort Lauderdale

00:18:50.555 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and report me lost at sea.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
He would turn around, and I
knew that was not the truth.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:90%
So it made me very angry.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And when he told me to give
up-- this was the third time--

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
to give up and slide on
down, it wouldn't hurt,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I kind of looked up over
here, and I said, "Look here,

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I've told you that I'm going
to swim all day and all night.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I said if I'm 10
feet under the water,

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm still going to be
moving my arms and legs."

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I said, "You got that, Fella?"

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I was
embarrassed, because I realized

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:90%
I was talking to a voice.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm by myself out there.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:10%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER):
Miraculously, after remaining

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:10%
adrift for what felt
like an eternity,

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:10%
Don Spann had managed
to stay afloat,

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:10%
while his companion, John
T, searched the open seas.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I
heard this deep rumble,

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:90%
blum, blum, blum, blum.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was the exhaust
sound of a boat.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was old Perseverance,
that was my boat.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I knew her sound.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I got thrilled, but I
was on my back to save energy.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, don't turnover yet,
don't turn over yet, not yet.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally I said, roll
over now, and I rolled over

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and there she was.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I had to figure out
a way to get out the way

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and still be seen,
because it's so

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:84%
hard to find anybody or anything
in the ocean specifically.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
If you stop and think about
my little ole coconut head

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.765 align:middle line:90%
was the only thing sticking up.

00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:84%
For an eight mile
radius, how are you going

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:90%
to find something this small?

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And he looked my way three
times and didn't see me.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting
discouraged, and he

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:84%
was coming at 11,
10:30, 10 o'clock

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and was getting quicker.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I
saw John T lower the glasses

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and put them back
up, lower them,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:90%
and then the hollered, "Don."

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh,
thank God he sees me.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of rolled over, and
I went partially blacked out.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER): Then in
a nearly tragic twist of fate,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
the hull of the boat that
was about to rescue Don,

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.172 align:middle line:84%
pushed him under the water,
and he began to sink.

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:84%
DONALD MANN: And I started
sliding down towards the center

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:84%
of the boat and back
away, because I drifted

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.805 align:middle line:84%
at a different rate
than what the boat

00:21:20.805 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:90%
was drifting on the surface.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was a light
over here to the left,

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and I knew there was no
sunshine a moment before.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
filtered yellow light.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:84%
It looked like I was looking
through a pitcher of tea.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to pull
on the rope to get myself

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:90%
to the boat with my left hand.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't have the
strength to move anything else.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
kaploosh, and it

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
looked just the same as when
you're in a swimming pool

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and you see a million bubbles
up there when somebody

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:90%
jumps in on top of you.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And I witnessed that,
and then I thought don't

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:90%
fight John T. Let him help you.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a hand on my bicep,
and then a separate hand

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.377 align:middle line:90%
on my forearm.

00:22:03.377 --> 00:22:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't figure out, I
said, how's he going to help

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:90%
me get to the boat like that?

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I felt
hands on my shoulder blades,

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and I went straight
to the ladder,

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
just like I belonged
there, like a magnet.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't get my leg
up on that bottom rung,

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:90%
which was right about my waist.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.440 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't have the strength.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And that takes
strength on a good day

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:90%
if you're having a good time.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It's still a tough
job to get up.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
get my foot up there,

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and all a sudden, I felt a hand
on my calf and one on my ankle.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And it placed my
foot up there for me,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and then I felt
hands under my hiney.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And up I went just like
I was on a hydraulic lift

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:90%
of some kind or another.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.067 align:middle line:90%
I just stood up.

00:22:44.067 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER): Don was
whisked to the nearest hospital

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and treated for
exposure and exhaustion.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It was only then that
he began to fully

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
understand the implications
of his miraculous rescue.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:84%
John T comes in, I give
John T the biggest hug going.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't pay somebody
for saving your life.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to somebody?

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:90%
There's no words.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Just thank you is
not good enough.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, after we
greeted each other,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and he told me this went from
the worst day of his life

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to the best day of his
life all in the same day,

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I said John T you
scared me half to death.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Why did you jump in the water?

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
He said what are
you talking about?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I saw you jump in,
and you grabbed a hold of me.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, Don, what
you talking about?

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I never left the boat.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it hit me like
a ton of bricks.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
All the pieces of the puzzle
suddenly came together.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
This voice that I heard
three times in the ocean,

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:90%
I actually heard four times.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
That first time was you're
going out of the boat

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:90%
this morning, fella.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And if I heard that voice this
second, I would recognize it.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
It was-- as far
as I'm concerned,

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:90%
it was the devil himself.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
The helping me to the
boat was the opposite end

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:90%
of the spectrum.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' will was for his guardian
angels to help me some way,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.595 align:middle line:84%
some-- I don't know
why, but they did.

00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:90%
And I got help to that boat.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:90%
I call it a blessing.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced the
hands on of a guardian

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:90%
angel, more than one.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
John, I'm curious,
are there patterns,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
are there consistencies as
to whom these angels help?

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.820 align:middle line:10%
That brings up a really
touchy point there,

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of people feel
bad if they've had a tragedy

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and there was no spiritual
intervention to help them.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And they might say to
themselves, well, why me?

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Is God mad at me or something?

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen any
indication that that

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:90%
could possibly be true.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But answering the
question of why do angels

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:90%
go on vacation, as I call it?

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Why was Steven stoned
in the book of Acts,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:84%
but just a couple of
chapters down Peter was

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:90%
freed by an angel, you know.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
There have been--
the philosophers

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
have not been able to settle
that one in thousands of years

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:90%
of wrestling with the question.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
They have come up
with a few theories.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel that
the theory of karma

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:84%
might be an explanation, the
idea that what we put out

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:84%
in the world comes back to
us, reverberates back to us

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:90%
in some fashion or form.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
pointed out that, well,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
our natural abilities vary
from person to person.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people take to a foreign
language like a duck to water.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Other people stumble tongue-tied
trying to learn it for years.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people, by this
token, some people

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:84%
may be more psychically gifted
and may be able to communicate.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It may be that the angels
are trying to get through

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
in all instances, but in
some cases they get through,

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and in other cases, they
just can't be picked up.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
JOAN WESTER ANDERSON:
People say, well,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.940 align:middle line:90%
what makes the difference?

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Why do angels come
sometimes and not others?

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.340 align:middle line:10%
Well, I don't know.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:10%
But I do know that a lot
of times we don't ask.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The Bible says you have
not because you ask not.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:90%
It's so typical.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't think that
we can bring about a change

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual point of
view, and so we don't even try.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER):
Jocelyn Vaile and a friend

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
found themselves stranded
on a mountaintop in Uruguay,

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:90%
and they did ask for help.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:10%
We had been up there for,
I guess, a couple of hours.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.460 align:middle line:10%
And we looked down and saw that
the bus that brought us there

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:10%
along with the rest of
our group was pulling off,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:10%
and it was leaving.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know if they had
left anybody there to find us.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know if they even
knew that we were there.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was at this point
that we both really panicked.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:90%
I was crying and she was crying.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.300 align:middle line:90%
We were both really scared.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And to try to keep ourselves
from going too crazy

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
or from freaking out,
we started praying,

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and we started
singing praise songs.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So we tried just
climbing down for a while

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and that got to be too hard.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what we would finally
do is just place ourselves

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.830 align:middle line:84%
between two boulders,
kind of on the ground,

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and kind of like, scoot
forward a little bit,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:84%
like a kid on a slide and
push ourselves forward some.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:90%
And that worked.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It was getting us
towards the bottom.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And so we were relieved.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:84%
We finally had something, you
know, some way that we were

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:90%
going to get to the bottom.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
After we've been doing that
for about half an hour,

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
just sliding down, this
man walks up to us.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
He was a young man, and my
friend I thought, oh, good,

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:84%
finally, somebody can
show us the way down.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we're yelling ayuda,
ayuda, and pointing down.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:84%
That was the one word we
could think of in Spanish.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:90%
It means help.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we're yelling
ayuda, ayuda,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and pointing down, and crying,
and screaming, and everything.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
The man took my hand,
and he took her hand

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and started leading
us to the left.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And we just stopped, and
we said, no, that way.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And again started saying ayuda,
ayuda, and pointing down.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And he just kind of
nodded and took our hands

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and kept leading us to the left.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And he lead us to the
left for quite some way.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
anything of it at the time,

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't very far
after that, he started,

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:90%
finally, leading us down.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking,
well, finally,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
he's figured out
what we want here.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing us
the way to the bottom.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And when we got to the bottom,
they hadn't forgotten us.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
They had left a translator
and my mother there.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed up and showed
her where we had been.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And the place where we had
been trying to slide down,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:84%
we were less than 10 feet
away from going over a cliff.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that,
we both just kind of

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:90%
lost it at that point.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:51.870 align:middle line:84%
We knew that we would not
have been able to get down.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And the four of us
are walking together,

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and the man just
stopped walking.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And we took a few more
steps and turned around

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and the man was gone.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:90%
There were no footprints.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
We could see our
footprints in the sand

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't see his from the
point where he had disappeared.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:84%
There was nowhere
for him to have gone.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:90%
There were no trees around.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
There were no cars, no
buildings, nothing, nowhere

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.896 align:middle line:90%
where he could have gone.

00:29:15.896 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
TEDDY BART: Do angels, do
they appear in human form?

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
JOHN RONNOR: Some
people say that,

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.550 align:middle line:84%
yes, they saw an
angel that appeared

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:90%
to them as a human being.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And they've determined that
it was an angel, because

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:84%
of the many uncanny
circumstances that surrounded

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.860 align:middle line:90%
the incident of intervention.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
The term, angel,
is so loosely used

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
that for all practical
purposes, you really

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.970 align:middle line:84%
have to investigate to find
out what a person has in mind

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:84%
when they say they
have an angel.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER): We
hear countless stories

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:84%
of angels who warn and rescue
people in their time of need.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:84%
But I also found stories of
angels tending to another kind

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
of need, the deep
need for comfort,

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.640 align:middle line:84%
which people face when grieving
the loss of someone dear

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:10%
I spent the last three months
of my father's life with him,

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.865 align:middle line:10%
and we became very, very close.

00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:07.020 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:84%
There were many nights when
he would ask me to come over

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:90%
and be with him that night.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was in extreme pain
because the cancer had just

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:90%
run through this entire body.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:84%
The night that he
died, I was in bed

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:84%
mulling over the day's
activities and the feelings,

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and trying to process
how I was going

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to react when word finally
came that my father had died.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It certainly couldn't
be a surprise,

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:84%
because we knew it was just
a matter of any minute now.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of went through those
feelings and emotions right

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:90%
before I drifted off to sleep.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I was awakened by the spirit
that zoomed right over

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.896 align:middle line:84%
from my feet, right
over the top of me

00:30:52.896 --> 00:30:56.935 align:middle line:84%
and hovered on the left side
of my bed at my shoulders.

00:30:56.935 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of a
glowing, misty cloud

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:90%
is the best way to describe it.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.395 align:middle line:84%
But I immediately
recognized it as my father.

00:31:03.395 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:84%
He was emanating these
absolute feelings of well

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:90%
being and joy and freedom.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
While my father was
hovering beside my bed,

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and we were just sort of basking
in each other's presence,

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:84%
feeling each other's feelings,
the best way to describe it

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:84%
a connection opened up
off to the distance.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I could feel an awareness off
and to a further off place,

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I could hear other beings
talking amongst themselves.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were what I
would describe as angels.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But my father turned and
looked in that direction,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and then he looked back
at me and acknowledged

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and immediately said,
"They're calling me now,

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and I have to go."

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And when he said that, there
was more than just that.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:84%
There was this complete
sense of mission

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that he had of
where it was he had to go next.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And that he had to
go with these beings,

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and it was time for him to
proceed to this next realm.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:10%
It was back in 1984
when I received word

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.755 align:middle line:10%
that my sister had expired.

00:32:12.755 --> 00:32:15.390 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I immediately got in my car and
started to drive to Chicago.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.795 align:middle line:90%
And I was upset with God.

00:32:23.795 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I was asking him why,
Lord, why my sister?

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.850 align:middle line:90%
She had everything to live for.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:90%
20 years old.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was so mad, just
bitter underneath the skin.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the
funeral, I was still

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.090 align:middle line:84%
asking the same
questions, Lord why,

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:90%
why did you take my sister?

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.523 align:middle line:90%
Then a few weeks went past.

00:32:47.523 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:90%
It was March the 25th.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I was in my room, and all of
a sudden this light appeared.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a big, bright light.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.175 align:middle line:84%
Something I've
never seen before,

00:33:01.175 --> 00:33:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and I've never been
able to see again.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And out of the light, a
voice said to me, "Fear not.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Your sister's in
a better place."

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said that
sometimes God has to take

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:90%
the best flower in the garden.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I could
feel all of the tension,

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
all of the anger,
just leave my body.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:90%
It seem to be real clear.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Just a clear, bright light,
something like a new day.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And it really was
a new day for me,

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.904 align:middle line:84%
because it was really
my Resurrection.

00:33:43.904 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER):
Whether the angel appears

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:84%
through a touch, a smell,
a mysterious nudge,

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.710 align:middle line:84%
a sudden insight, through an
average looking human being,

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:84%
or in a blinding flash of
light, all these stories

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.870 align:middle line:84%
have one thing in common,
the players come away

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:90%
believing something happened.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Someone was there.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I am not alone.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.969 align:middle line:84%
According to all the great and
lasting religions of the world,

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:27.080 align:middle line:84%
angels have been with us
from the beginning of time.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
Angels unseen for
the most part have

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.600 align:middle line:84%
always been heavily involved
in the world's unfolding.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
DR. DAVID KIDD: In
the New Testament,

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.989 align:middle line:84%
we see the appearance
of angels at almost

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:41.770 align:middle line:84%
every significant
moment of the story.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Angels are involved in
announcing Jesus's birth.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:84%
They attend to him
at His temptation.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:84%
They appear in a variety of
His encounters in the world.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:10%
They are the voice
which first proclaims

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.325 align:middle line:10%
His Resurrection, which
is this touchstone

00:34:56.325 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:10%
of the Christian faith.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:10%
Judaism being the oldest
of the Western religions,

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:10%
has gone through a
whole series of changes

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.860 align:middle line:10%
from the Biblical time to
modern religious belief

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.170 align:middle line:10%
as far as philosophy and
theology are concerned.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But the concept of
angels has always

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.860 align:middle line:84%
been a presence, no matter
what period of time you study,

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:84%
or what period of liturgy you
appreciate within Jewish life.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.080 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, in the
Tanakth as we call it,

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.560 align:middle line:84%
the concept of angels were to be
servants or assistants to God.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.960 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew word angel is malakh
and malakh also carries with it

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of messenger.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:84%
They were the
go-betweens between God

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and the people of the Earth.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.170 align:middle line:84%
There were two angels in the
earliest biblical tradition

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.520 align:middle line:84%
whose power and authority
have never been questioned up

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:84%
until modern times, and
these with the archangels

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:84%
as they're referred to
Gabriel and Michael.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Even their names
are Hebrew words.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Michael meaning in
Hebrew, cocktail

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Michael, who is like God?

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel, Gabriel,
the strength of God,

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.870 align:middle line:90%
or God is my strength.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.740 align:middle line:84%
These two figures had, amongst
their other responsibilities,

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the privilege of praising God.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.890 align:middle line:10%
In Islam we have what we
call the Articles of Faith.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:10%
We believe in the wonderful God.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:10%
Believe in the
prophets, the books,

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:10%
the messengers, and the angels.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Angels play a very significant
role in the Islamic faith.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We learn in the
Holy Koran Jibrayil,

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.920 align:middle line:84%
which means Gabriel in
Arabic, he brought the Koran

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.620 align:middle line:90%
to the prophet.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.685 align:middle line:84%
He would cite a
part, the prophet

00:36:45.685 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
would remember that part, and he
would teach it to his follows.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And then Gabriel would
come and recite more,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and he would teach
it to his followers.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:90%
And this went on for 23 years.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the Koran, it tells us
that every person has guardian

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.220 align:middle line:90%
angels as guardians over them.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And they write down
every deed that they do.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you do the right
thing and say the right thing.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you will receive a
book on the day of Judgement,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and that book will
have every deed

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.190 align:middle line:90%
that you have ever done in it.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.180 align:middle line:90%
So do be careful.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, first of all,
we believe that angels

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:10%
are personal, spiritual
beings who are non-corporeal.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.370 align:middle line:84%
They're like human
beings in the sense

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that they have
intelligence and free will.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.100 align:middle line:90%
They can know and love.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But they're unlike
humans in the sense

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have
physical bodies.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So they share with
us a common bond,

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:84%
we're all creatures
of God, and yet

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:90%
they are distinct human beings.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I guess that there are two kind
of uniquely Catholic beliefs,

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:90%
if I can put it that way.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
One we do emphasize
on our Feast Days

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:90%
a focus on guardian angels.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Catholic
belief that the angels

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:90%
guard each one of us.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.290 align:middle line:90%
They protect us.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:84%
The other major Feast
Day that we celebrate

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Catholic
tradition would be

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.630 align:middle line:84%
the Feast of the
Archangels, of Michael,

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.030 align:middle line:90%
of Gabriel, and Raphael.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.530 align:middle line:84%
They're called
archangels because they

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.325 align:middle line:84%
have special important
roles to play

00:38:13.325 --> 00:38:17.227 align:middle line:90%
in God's plan of salvation.

00:38:17.227 --> 00:38:18.960 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER): So
it seems that if we believe

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in anything spiritual, then it
only makes good common sense

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.260 align:middle line:90%
to believe in angels.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But are these heavenly
beings only for the Earth

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.705 align:middle line:90%
so-called believing population?

00:38:30.705 --> 00:38:35.360 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Raymond Moody is
renowned for his research

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.140 align:middle line:84%
into near death experiences
reported by people who

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.540 align:middle line:84%
were declared
clinically dead and then

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:90%
were medically resuscitated.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.050 align:middle line:10%
Angel sightings are commonly
reported in these near death

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.690 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:10%
When I was a medical student
in the pediatrics rotation,

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:58.560 align:middle line:10%
I was in the Pediatrics
Endocrinology Clinic,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:10%
and this was long before
there was any publicity

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.610 align:middle line:10%
about near death
experiences, and nobody

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.870 align:middle line:10%
knew that I was studying them.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
with a little boy who

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:84%
was 11 years old who said,
"Doctor, a year ago I had

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.680 align:middle line:90%
a crisis, and I almost died."

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I think he said that he died.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "And when
I died, I went up."

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:10%
He described this
ascension and into a place

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:36.060 align:middle line:10%
of beautiful light, and he
said that he was surrounded

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:10%
by flocks of angels, and that
he was seeing all these angels

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:10%
all around him as he went up.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And I talked with
him about that,

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:90%
and I asked him for more detail.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear that he was
not talking about winged beings,

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:84%
like he might have
seen in a child's book,

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:59.440 align:middle line:84%
but more in terms of beings
of light, beautiful people

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.270 align:middle line:84%
who were full of love and
who were there to help him.

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Another case that really
I remember quite vividly

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is a woman who wrote to
me, actually, after she had

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.150 align:middle line:90%
seen an article on my research.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I later talked
to her at length.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And she described how when
she was dying in the hospital,

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and she got out of her body
and she looked down and saw

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:33.190 align:middle line:84%
the doctor's trying to
resuscitate her and so on,

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and she said immediately she was
in the presence of two beings

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:84%
who she later identified
as her guiding angels.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this was
particularly interesting,

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.820 align:middle line:84%
because this woman came
from a Protestant background

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of
a guardian angel

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:58.630 align:middle line:84%
was not something that was
in her religious tradition.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But she said that even though
she had never seen these people

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that she had a sense of
great familiarity and warmth

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.920 align:middle line:90%
and love from them.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:10%
And there was this
slight buzzing at the ear,

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.490 align:middle line:10%
and I felt myself
pop out of the body.

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I came out.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I was just suddenly
out of the body.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down on the
head of the bed a minute

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:90%
to look around.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Then I felt myself
float up to the ceiling,

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.435 align:middle line:90%
and I was looking down.

00:41:28.435 --> 00:41:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And they said, she's gone.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe it, and
I thought, well, who's gone?

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
look down to see.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I felt presences with
me of guardian angels

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:84%
is what they were, but
I called them guides.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:84%
DR. MOODY: And I remember her
mentioning to me that at times

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:53.580 align:middle line:84%
of stress after that when
things didn't go quite right,

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that she would always go
back in her mind and heart

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:84%
to that point, and to
think about those people

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:90%
that she had been there with.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.050 align:middle line:84%
JOAN WESTER ANDERSON: People
sometimes say, why do you think

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:90%
there's so much going on now?

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is an
end of an era coming.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But I have kind of
come to the conclusion

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot of spiritual
activity going on now, both

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:90%
the negative and the positive.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we see every
kind of depravity

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that there is right now, and
many accepted as just routine.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But yet, at the same
time, we're hearing

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.840 align:middle line:84%
all these magnificent encounters
and people's moments of grace.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I think I've been touched
by a heavenly presence.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to understand
that God loves me.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:57.020 align:middle line:84%
My child seems to be so
aware of spiritual things.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:02.690 align:middle line:84%
There is an angel that
you can connect with

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:08.736 align:middle line:84%
and will talk to you that
will allow you to be positive.

00:43:08.736 --> 00:43:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to give
up on life just because you

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:90%
had a bad experience.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:84%
It's been very comforting
to think that there

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:23.050 align:middle line:90%
is a presence that is with me.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And can be there, and can
help me, even when I don't

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:90%
know to ask for help myself.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And to realize that there
are angelic beings, as well

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:37.570 align:middle line:84%
as other previously deceased
relatives or friends, that

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in some way can help us
through this thing called life,

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.290 align:middle line:90%
it's exciting.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.580 align:middle line:90%
It's what's next?

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:90%
That was an angel.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:84%
That was an angel and I
really believe that it was.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's not what people--
even if somebody doesn't

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:02.190 align:middle line:84%
believe that it was actually
an angel from heaven,

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it was definitely
someone that God sent.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.310 align:middle line:84%
If nothing else, it's as
close to scientific proof

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll ever have is there's
something between worldly,

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:16.270 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, and
heaven as we envision it.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I say there's something in the
middle called guardian angels.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And now that I have three
children and a husband

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.570 align:middle line:84%
that I love very much,
it's also very comforting

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to know that if that
presence is here for me,

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:84%
then it's also
available for them.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.560 align:middle line:84%
PAM KIDD (VOICEOVER): And so
the angels seem to tell us,

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.560 align:middle line:90%
we are not alone.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Are they not messengers sent
by a Supreme Being, offered

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.670 align:middle line:84%
as protectors, as guides, as
benefactors whose only earthly

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.840 align:middle line:90%
purpose is to care for us?

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Here unseen, are they hovering
near waiting to be listened to,

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.550 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be called on?

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Hoping to guide us over
the rough spots of living,

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.130 align:middle line:84%
ready to lead us into
new and wonderfully

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:90%
evolved levels of life on Earth?

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we've barely
scratched the surface.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:84%
There's so much left to
know, and so very many

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.640 align:middle line:90%
angel stories yet to be told.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.090 align:middle line:90%
