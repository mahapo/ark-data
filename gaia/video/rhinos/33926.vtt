(girl crying)

5
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Man>No you can keep it.</v>

6
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:34.057
I'm sorry I don't understand what you're saying.

7
00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:42.781
You're German.

8
00:01:44.462 --> 00:01:45.938
<v ->German, yeah.</v>

9
00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:50.027
<v ->Are you here on holidays?</v>

10
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.523
<v ->Hm?</v>

11
00:01:51.523 --> 00:01:56.493
<v ->You, you here, and holidays.</v>

12
00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:02.626 line:15% 
Yeah, holidays.

13
00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.349
You work for the Golden Pages?

14
00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:17.171
The German branch, I guess.

15
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:18.887
<v ->Yeah, German.</v>

16
00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:22.813
Ingrid.

17
00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:26.540
<v ->Thomas.</v>

18
00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:32.724
(phone buzzes)

19
00:02:32.724 --> 00:02:36.015
<v ->(laughs) Here.</v>

20
00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:42.132
<v ->It's your fella, is it?</v>

21
00:02:42.132 --> 00:02:43.828
Arschloch...

22
00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:45.741
It's a nice name.

23
00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:11.343
I don't understand.

24
00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:17.826
(speaking German)

25
00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:21.083
<v ->You're okay, thanks.</v>

26
00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:23.140
No, it's fine.

27
00:03:27.088 --> 00:03:28.085
Can I--

28
00:03:35.377 --> 00:03:38.383
(making monkey sounds)

29
00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:39.863
<v ->Can I just get my book?</v>

30
00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:43.806
Could you just give me my book, please?

31
00:03:44.312 --> 00:03:45.388
Give me the fuckin'--

32
00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:51.219
(sighs) Thank you.

33
00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.860
(speaks German)

34
00:04:18.947 --> 00:04:23.623
(slow music)

35
00:04:35.448 --> 00:04:37.613
<v ->This is the GPO.</v>

36
00:04:37.613 --> 00:04:39.271
It's where the Irish fought the British.

37
00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:40.657
In the 1916 rising.

38
00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:45.612
See this?

39
00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:46.904
It's a bullet hole.
(imitates gun sound)

40
00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:53.034
(arcade sounds)

41
00:05:07.178 --> 00:05:08.745
Do you want to meet my friends?

42
00:05:10.264 --> 00:05:14.856
(happy guitar music)

43
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:22.067
(speaking German)

44
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:25.954
<v ->Well, yeah, but he needs to protect himself.</v>

45
00:05:25.954 --> 00:05:28.023
Okay, he's built like a tank, but,

46
00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:29.624
generally speaking, rhinos are quite shy

47
00:05:29.624 --> 00:05:31.047
in personalities.

48
00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.452
(imitates animal sounds)

49
00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:11.069
<v ->Smile.</v>

50
00:06:15.948 --> 00:06:20.724
(speaks German)

51
00:06:21.538 --> 00:06:23.519
<v ->His name is Buddha, him.</v>

52
00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.194
<v ->Buddha.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

53
00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:27.541
<v ->Hey Buddha!</v>

54
00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.194
<v ->It means wise one.</v>

55
00:06:31.194 --> 00:06:33.008
'Cause of the great memories.

56
00:06:33.008 --> 00:06:35.045
You know, they never forget.

57
00:06:36.498 --> 00:06:38.566
They have an adoption program here

58
00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.219
that you pay a few Euros

59
00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:42.310
and you get to adopt an animal.

60
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.998
And Buddha, I adopt him. He come to me.

61
00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:59.504
(bell rings)

62
00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:04.579
(phone beeps)

63
00:07:13.693 --> 00:07:16.538
(speaks German)

64
00:07:16.538 --> 00:07:18.452
<v ->Oh, toilet, yeah, yeah.</v>

65
00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:06.006
(dance music plays quietly)

66
00:08:29.515 --> 00:08:31.791
<v ->Buddha.
(Thomas laughs)

67
00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:39.716
(speaks German)

68
00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:47.038
Hello.
(continues speaking in German)

69
00:08:56.558 --> 00:08:57.503
<v ->She wants you to turn it up.</v>

70
00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:01.236
<v ->I can't, sorry.</v>

71
00:09:02.223 --> 00:09:05.561
<v ->Look, I understand it's probably store policy, but...</v>

72
00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:06.816
you know, you'll really do me a favor

73
00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:08.160
if you'll just turn it up.

74
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.266
Just a fraction, just until the end of the song.

75
00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:21.025
(music gets louder)

76
00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:27.759
<v Voiceover>The store is now closing.</v>

77
00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:28.729
Please bring your purchase

78
00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:30.610
to the cash desk, thank you.

79
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.965
<v ->Who is it?</v>

80
00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:50.903
It's been so long since anybody talked to me.

81
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.857
Listened to me.

82
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.316
Touched me.

83
00:11:01.802 --> 00:11:03.374
I wish you didn't have to go.

84
00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.992
(phone buzzes)

85
00:12:06.972 --> 00:12:07.914
Arschloch?

86
00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:11.573
<v ->Arschloch.</v>

87
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.522
(slow music plays)

88
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.683
Thank you.

89
00:13:14.906 --> 00:13:17.236
