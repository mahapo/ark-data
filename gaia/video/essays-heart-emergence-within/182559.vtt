But I could never have

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:84%
a life of immersing myself
into worlds only to feel

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:84%
suffocated by the labels,

filled with having as
much fun as possible.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%

beneath the shinier surface,

behind the more fabulous
roles and higher end dramas,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%

something deeper.

a good part of the world.

something different.

And it was after a good number
of years the realization came

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:10%
that I was actually searching
for whether you want to call it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:10%
God, or self, or whatever.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%

we experience a
very physical world.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And we experience a

see through our emotions.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And experiences that
we have emotionally

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.227 align:middle line:84%

context or the texture

00:03:58.227 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:90%

this child, Atreyu.

needs to complete some tasks.

Complete the first,
complete the second.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:84%

I was thinking, what's

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:90%
going to happen now, right?

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Is he going to fight dragons?

What is going to happen now?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:10%
And then he's being told that
he needs to walk in this desert,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:10%
and he needs to face himself
and see himself in a mirror.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I
was so disappointed.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's going on here?

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Where's the action?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Only now as an adult I realize
how ingenious that task was.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I cannot think of a more
difficult and challenging task

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
than seeing ourselves
truly, truly as we are.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:90%
That's something we all avoid.

Without the masks,
without the gaze,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:90%
without the interpretations.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Really, truly see
what we are and who

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:90%
we are, and work with that.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%

kind of invitation

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:90%

to be about peace
and love and light.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:10%

three levels in the sense

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that you are in the present

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:90%
It's almost automatic.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%

like a time warp.

I realized I wanted to step

we carry literally in

I disengage from myself.

less judgmental about all that

have their beliefs,

That belief changes
the inevitable.

Like a pendulum,
you pull it back,

it will keep going forward.

So whatever people are trying to
do to stop the progress of time

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
or to pull us back
into an old age,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
it'll be impossible for
them to stop progress.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So either decide to be on
the side of the pullback

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
agents or the forward
thrust agents,

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
the ones who are only into
truth and divinity and grace.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the future.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:84%

Either we are

or we are extending love.

As I continue on the journey of

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:10%
living from my own heart and not

The cycles of life and

are temporary experiences.

The path forward is
uncertain, but it's exciting.

in the first place.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:10%
And so the onus is on
us, now with a divinity

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, to bring it
back to its original state.

And so therefore, it's even more
