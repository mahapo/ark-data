>> They say in esoteric circles,
if you don't have the organ

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of perception, if you don't
actually work on yourself

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to perceive in the proper way,
you just see the world as it

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:90%
is, not as it could be.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner could see
the world as it could be,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
not as it was, or
as it is even now.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:90%
He saw the world as it could be.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lonely
path, a very lonely path.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:10%
For me, what is unique about the
work of Rudolf Steiner, what's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:10%
inspired my life about it is
that it's not just a tradition.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:84%
He threw down the
glove and said,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
you have to do
something with this.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I think one of the greatest
challenges that Rudolf Steiner

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:10%
poses to us today is a challenge
that he lived with in his own

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:10%
life, namely the challenge to
battle against sectarianism.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, he felt sorry, because
he wanted to help people,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
but he wanted, more than this,
he wanted to let them free.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's the essential point.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
It's the freedom.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can help people and
give them your own treasure,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
but finally they live
out from your treasure,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:90%
and they are dependent.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the last
thing Steiner wanted

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:90%
to have-- dependent people.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:10%
>> I think Rudolf
Steiner was a realist,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:10%
and a very practical person.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.709 align:middle line:10%
I think he saw that he was
planting seeds for the future.

had a duck, E-I-E-I-O.

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:26.118 align:middle line:84%

and a quack quack there,

starting formally to
learn to read and write.

And like much of the
teaching in Steiner Schools,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
music and art are
incorporated into the lessons

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%

>> The South Devon School is one
of 35 Steiner Waldorf Schools

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:90%
in Britain.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
The first Waldorf School was
founded by Steiner in 1919

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:84%
at the request of Emil Molt,
owner of the Waldorf cigarette

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
factory in Stuttgart, who wanted
an education for the children

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:84%
of his employees that prepared
them for life in its fullest

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:90%
sense.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And life in its
fullest sense means

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
educating hands and
heart, as well as head.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Until the children go into class
one around the age of seven,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
the emphasis is on play,
imitation, and on rhythm--

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
baking on Monday,
painting on Wednesday,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
an expedition on
Thursday, and so on.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And on stories,
which are told rather

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.715 align:middle line:90%
than read by the teacher.

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And Steiner's picture
of child development

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
is not only of children growing
up, and thereby learning

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
the ways of the world, but
also of children growing down,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
bringing into life their
own unique biographies--

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
as he saw it, from
many lifetimes.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:10%
And this needs time--

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:10%
time to build a strong
and firm foundation

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:10%
so that each child can not only
then face the world as it is,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:10%
but also develop the strength
of character to maybe change it.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
These nine-year-olds are
not just studying farming,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
but actually doing it as part
of what is called main lesson--

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
one particular subject taught
for the first two hours

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
every morning over a period
of three or four weeks.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Around this age,
most children start

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
to take a new
interest in the world

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
around them whilst
also experiencing

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
a certain separation
from that world.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Now they begin to study
science, and in mathematics,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:90%
the concept of fractions.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Still waiting for silence.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, who remembers which are
those potatoes from the ones

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:90%
we planted?

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Are they--

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Early?

00:05:05.558 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Early?

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Only only?

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Late.

00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>> First early.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> First early.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Who can show me
blight in this book?

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Lily, show something to me.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Can you see?

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I can see from where I am.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Quite right.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Every digger should have two
other ones working together.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So it should be
groups of three--

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
a digger and two
collecting the potatoes.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:84%
The plants should all be
brought back here, please.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, girls?

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:90%
No, that's fine.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:90%
So one the side.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.498 align:middle line:90%
You are too many here.

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:50.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Crystal!

00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:52.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah!

00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:55.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they really seem
to be enjoying themselves.

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I thought children weren't
meant to like gardening.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:10%
>> They like
gardening very much,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:10%
because they can
see the end result.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So they've been involved in the
plowing of this field-- well,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:90%
spreading the muck.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:84%
The plowing of the field
was done by horses.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
pulled the plow.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:90%
So they had-- what is that?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> When can we see the lamb?

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Soon.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Seven.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Very gentle.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Eight, nine.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa, wow.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Four- teeny, sixteen--

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> They respond very well to
the activities we propose.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
The practical
ones, they're, yes!

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it!

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.694 align:middle line:84%
And there's a real enthusiasm
that comes from them.

00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are you from?

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.895 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm from Brazil.

00:06:43.895 --> 00:06:44.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Brazil.

00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm from Brazil, yeah.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.889 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are Waldorf
schools in Brazil?

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There are Waldorf
schools in Brazil,

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't connected
to schools there.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I was connected to the
biodynamic impulse,

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:90%
but not to schools.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Here you're doing both.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, sort of bringing
them together, really.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Andre is also helping this
class to build a stall from

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:84%
which they can sell
the vegetables.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Building is another subject
taught at this age--

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
planning, measuring,
and execution.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
The curriculum in
Steiner Schools

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is designed to introduce
subjects when they resonate

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and correspond to
where the child is

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:90%
at in his or her development.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Insight into what
you teach when,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and a recognition of
distinct seven-year phases

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.330 align:middle line:84%
in child development were two of
Steiner's special contributions

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:90%
to education.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.206 align:middle line:90%
>> What is this, Declan?

00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's to support--

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that's to attach
to the two poles

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:84%
together to make
them both steady.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> (CHANTING) Where we
walk to school each day,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Indian children used to play,
all about our native land where

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.265 align:middle line:90%
the shops and houses stand.

00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:90%
And the trees were very tall.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And there were no
streets at all.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Not a church, not a steeple,

00:16:48.034 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In a word, in a word what's
different is that I think this

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:84%
education makes it central
that we are dealing with

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:84%
the children and who they are
and who they can be rather than

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
with external
demands of society.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
External demands of
society are important,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:84%
but it has to start with the
children in their deep selves,

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:90%
who they are.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that was an
exciting, and important thing

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:90%
to help support happen.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible in schools,
in publicly funded schools

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
with all the accountability, to
not lose sight of the children?

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) Swing
low, sweet chariot,

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:10%
coming for to carry me home.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Swing low, sweet chariot,
coming for to carry me home.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The Washington Carver School
near Sacramento in California,

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
one of nearly 5,000 charter
schools throughout the USA.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And, like the Steiner
Academy Hereford,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:84%
publicly funded and
free to students,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:90%
but independently operated.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The head, Allegra
Alessandri, is gradually

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
introducing Waldorf
methods into what

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
was one of California's most
persistently failing schools.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:84%
A further 20 charter
schools in California

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
alone are likewise bringing some
of Steiner's educational ideas

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
to youngsters for whom
fee-paying schools are out

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:90%
of the question.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I asked Allegra how the
pupils and their families

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:90%
have reacted to her initiatives.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Is there resistance,
or do they respond?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because we
are a school of choice,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:84%
students opt out of their
large comprehensive high school

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:90%
to come here.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're making a
choice to be here.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:10%
And mostly what we hear
the majority of the time

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:10%
is, why didn't I
find this sooner?

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We have students who are
very creative and artistic,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.987 align:middle line:84%
who have been really
languishing in the system, who

00:19:27.987 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:84%
have been failing in
the system, and yet are

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
very bright students
with enormous talents.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And they come here and
find a place to flourish,

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
because they are developing and
growing, and that's recognized.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The compromises that
inevitably arise when Waldorf

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
methods are introduced into
mainstream education are

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:84%
a problem for some
Steiner purists.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me,
on a visit to a school

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:84%
like this one, that
Steiner would be delighted

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that people are
experimenting and moving

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:84%
beyond the borders of a movement
that can all too easily become

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:90%
inward-looking and even elitist.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps most important
of all, Allegra and her team

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
are making an
important contribution

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:84%
towards helping and encouraging
less fortunate young people.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I asked her what it was like
when she first took over.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>> There was gang activity.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We called the police
2, 3 times a day.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.245 align:middle line:90%
We had regular drug busts.

00:20:28.245 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
We confiscated many,
many ounces of marijuana

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:90%
over the school year.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
We had many fights that we
were breaking up in classrooms,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:90%
outside of classrooms.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
There were maybe two
or three thefts a day.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Allegra used
the word "process"

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:10%
to describe what is
happening at her school.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Not yet a full Waldorf
curriculum in place,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
but they now have
a choir, a garden.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Fruit trees have been planted.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Waldorf-trained teachers
are gradually joining her.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And fighting is a much more
skilled and disciplined affair.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:10%
Many such initiatives,
not just in schools,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:10%
inspired by Steiner's
insights into the nature

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:10%
of the human being--

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:10%
what he called anthroposophy--

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:10%
are springing up
all over America

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:10%
and elsewhere in the world.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Coordinating a whole
series of activities--

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
agricultural, educational,
and cultural in upstate New

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:90%
York in Hawthorne valley--

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
is Martin Ping.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot that doesn't
seem to make too much sense

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
anymore, and yet we've
grown up with it.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:38.777 align:middle line:90%
We've created it.

00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Human beings have created
the system we're in now.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:10%
So there's something in that
that we are challenged by,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.939 align:middle line:10%
because it's not like it
was necessarily just imposed

00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:48.188 align:middle line:10%
from outer space or something.

00:21:48.188 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:90%
We did this.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So how do we find
our way out of it?

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
If we're beginning
to see the cracks,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're beginning to feel
like it's not meeting us

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:84%
at a very, very
deep, human level,

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
then how do we find
our way back out?

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I think Steiner really had a
lot of very fine indications

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that provide a bit of
a roadmap for that.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just Steiner.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's obviously many,
many ways in which people

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
are approaching our
modern predicament.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Agriculture is certainly
one of our modern predicaments.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And already back in
1924, when Steiner

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
gave a course of lectures to
farmers in central Europe,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
there was concerned
about the effect

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that chemical fertilizers
were having on the soil

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and on the quality
of the food we eat.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:84%
The importance of
organic farming

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
is increasingly recognized.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Steiner's biodynamic
method goes further,

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in that the preparations
used on the land

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.720 align:middle line:84%
are designed not only to enhance
the quality of the produce,

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
but also to heal the
Earth in the process.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And a recognition of the
role that not only the sun

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and moon, but also
the planets play

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:84%
in plant growth and the health,
determines when you sow what.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I asked the farmer
at Hawthorne Valley

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
how he would describe
the challenge posed

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:90%
by Rudolf Steiner's insights.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I think his basic challenge,
I would think he was so far--

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I think the
picture of agriculture

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:10%
that he gives is going
to be valid for hundreds

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:10%
and hundreds of years still,
for us to really grasp it.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And then certainly the real
challenge for all of us

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
is develop the
insight and develop

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.259 align:middle line:84%
the capacities to really
see what he described.

00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not good enough
to just be able to recount it.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.133 align:middle line:90%
We'll have to be able to see it.

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> To develop insights and
capacities of their own is what

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%
these two modern day alchemists
are trying to do in this

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.235 align:middle line:90%
California garage.

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Their task-- to make
biodynamic preparations

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:84%
based on indications
by Steiner that

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
are not only an effective
alternative to chemical

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and potentially harmful
substances that are marketed

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
worldwide, but also more
appropriate to the soil

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and climate of California
and the tropics than those

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.910 align:middle line:90%
used in Western Europe.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I asked Dennis
Klocek to what extent

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Steiner was tapping into
something that we knew

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%
in the past and have forgotten.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Rudolf Steiner didn't
appear just out of the blue.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
There's an old saying,
genius never escapes its age.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:10%
So here's a genius, and he
brought the best elements

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:52.770 align:middle line:10%
from the ancient traditions
together and synthesized them

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:10%
in a scientific context.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why his work is
called spiritual science.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was
really important

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific
context be recognized

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
by spiritually minded
people, because he grew up

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
at a time in his development
when spiritism and Ouija boards

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and table tapping and seances--

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that was the way people
got access to spirit.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And he inherited the
mantle of theosophy,

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:90%
and that was part of their lore.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was, no, it
has to be made in the same way

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:90%
that we make science.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
However, on the
other side of science

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:84%
is this death rationale for us
that can't imagine life forces

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.860 align:middle line:90%
and beings as spiritual beings.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole other dimension,
and they're separated now.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's necessary to bring
those two together in order

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:84%
for science to be redeemed,
and in order for spiritual work

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to move into the future rather
than just be stuck on what

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:90%
we inherited from the past.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It has to move into the future,
but the scientific revolution

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
is not random.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not an anomaly.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a reality.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's not going to go away.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So the scientific worldview
is not going to go away.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So we can't just go out and hug
trees and talk about fairies

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and hope that that's
going to go somewhere.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Even if that's the
perception that we have,

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that has to be
grounded in reason.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's both.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It's an inheritance
from the past,

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and if you read
Paracelsus and Basil

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Valentine and the
alchemists, you'll

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
see everywhere in their
work is these threads

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that Rudolf Steiner was
picking on and pulling forward.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet, with his cosmology
and his rational training

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:84%
in science, he could
move it further.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Dennis Klocek teaches
consciousness studies at this

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:90%
college near Sacramento.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:84%
His colleague, Matias
Baker, a fellow researcher,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:84%
is consultant to a number
of biodynamic vineyards

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:84%
When Dennis referred
earlier to his preparations

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
as medicine for the
Earth, I asked him

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:90%
why the Earth needed medicine.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
If we left it alone and stopped
spraying it with chemicals,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't it be perfectly happy?

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.060 align:middle line:84%
If we left it alone, it
would be very lonely.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's our mother, and
she says to us all the time,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.630 align:middle line:84%
you haven't called
home in awhile.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You're only using my
bank account to live.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So you need to love me
and nurture me and feed me

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
with medicines, because
I'm sick from your neglect.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The Benziger family have,
in Dennis Klocek's words,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.100 align:middle line:84%
been nurturing this plot
of land for over 30 years.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Biodynamic wine is
becoming highly prized,

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.830 align:middle line:84%
not just here in California,
but across the world.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And like all biodynamic
farms, this enterprise

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
avoids the modern
trend for mono-crops.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Alongside the vines there are
animals and a great variety

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
of plants and herbs that help
regulate the insect population

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and balance the
farm as a totality,

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:48.510 align:middle line:84%
avoiding the need for chemicals
and artificial fertilizers.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:10%
They call it the insectuary.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Basically, it propagates with
bugs, then they sort it out.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:10%
We have some good bugs
and some bad bugs,

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:10%
and they slug it out here.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully what we
do is we have a balance,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.632 align:middle line:84%
so that they're in
here eating the plants

00:29:04.632 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and eating each other instead
of going out there and eating

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:90%
the grapevines.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if we were
mono-cropping,

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:84%
then we put a huge bull's eye
on the back of that grapevine.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the only thing that's
green is that grapevine.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So every bug is going
to fly and eat that.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a wide
expanse, so there's

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things on the menu,
not just the grapevines.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And the entire 85 acres
are treated with the organic

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.445 align:middle line:84%
preparations that all
biodynamic farmers use.

00:29:29.445 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Chris Benziger and his family
have farmed here in the Sonoma

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.035 align:middle line:90%
district since the 1980s.

00:29:40.035 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When we first moved out here,
we were very much conventional

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.634 align:middle line:84%
farmers, because we
didn't know any better.

00:29:44.634 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And conventional
farming I kind of

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:90%
call the spray-and-pray method.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
For every disease or every
bug you had a spray out there,

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and for every lack of
nutrients in the vineyard

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:84%
you had a fertilizer that
you put down, a chemical one.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:58.050 align:middle line:90%
So we did that.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And since this place was
left vacant for 50 years,

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:90%
it was in a wonderful state.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful
piece of property.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.631 align:middle line:84%
But we slowly killed it with
spraying these pesticides.

00:30:06.631 --> 00:30:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being a small
kid running through here,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and it was a verdant garden.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And then every year it would die
a little bit until eventually,

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.356 align:middle line:84%
in the mid '80s, it
was a green desert.

00:30:15.356 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
was green where the

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:90%
canopies of the grapevines--

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:19.750 align:middle line:90%
nothing else.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.083 align:middle line:84%
And the only sound I heard
weren't insects but the wind.

00:30:22.083 --> 00:30:24.270 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty much a dead place.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And the ground was crunchy.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It was hard, if not pulverized.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.364 align:middle line:90%
And so we had erosion issues.

00:30:30.364 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And then worst of all,
the quality of the wine

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:90%
was diminishing.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
We were really putting
scars on this land

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't heal.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We realized very quickly
we had to do something.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And so in the early
'90s, my brother

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
had a book on
biodynamics that he had

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:90%
toted around his whole life.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And the book kind of
jumped out at him.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, he
met this wonderful guide

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Allen York, who
was kind of the biodynamic guru

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And the two got together and
formed a great friendship,

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and we started to, in
1994, started to bring

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.080 align:middle line:90%
in biodynamic practices here.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And it took us about six
years, but in the year 2000

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
we were certified-- the first
winery in the Sonoma-Napa area

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.840 align:middle line:84%
to be certified by Demeter
as a biodynamic winery.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And this place
changed radically,

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
going from this green desert
to this beautiful piece

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
of property that
you see here today.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:90%
It's alive on many levels.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And people like Matias, then,
have been advising you, yeah?

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:30.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, Matias and Allen have
been instrumental in how

00:31:30.069 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to understand this
piece of property,

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and unlock the secrets of
farming biodynamically.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Chris and Matias went on
to tell me that essentially

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
the vine doesn't
want to be alone.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I asked them if that was
true of plants all together.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Is monoculture against nature?

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I personally think
it absolutely is.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And we see that, because nature
always fills the gaps in terms

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:90%
of where the balance needs.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:10%
So you'll see disease pressure,
funguses, or different insects

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.630 align:middle line:10%
that come in to kind
of help break down

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:10%
that monoculture in a sense.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's evidence there that
shows that nature recognizes

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:90%
that it has an imbalance.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Chris you've got this
wonderful visitor center.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:84%
People come here
and look around.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
What's the public's
reaction to biodynamics?

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> They-- first is, wow, I
didn't realize all that went

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:90%
on to make a bottle of wine.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing
that they kind of say.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.026 align:middle line:84%
And then they've
go, a lot of them

00:32:34.026 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:84%
say, well, that's how
my grandfather farmed.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Or that's how my old uncle
back in the old land farmed.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's a lot more
to what you are doing than

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.350 align:middle line:84%
what's called organic
agriculture, isn't there?

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it brings in this
whole element of the planets.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:90%
What do people think about that?

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is a little
element there where people

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:90%
think, whoa, that's crazy.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's funny, because
when you explain to them

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
rhythms and things like
that, then they get it.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But when you just say
cowhorn and biodynamics,

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
they think, what the
heck's a cowhorn for?

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But biodynamics is more than
just cowhorns filled with cow

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:84%
manure that are buried in
the earth for six months over

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the winter before spraying the
substance that's created onto

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.970 align:middle line:90%
the land.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
What underlies Steiner's
picture of nature,

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and indeed, the whole phenomenal
world including ourselves,

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.290 align:middle line:84%
is an invisible
realm of beings--

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:84%
some more evolved than
we are, some less so--

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that support and sustain
life in its fullest sense.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I asked Chris how his fellow
Americans related to the idea

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that what they call God
is intimately connected

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.460 align:middle line:84%
to what surrounds us
in our daily lives,

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and not only to a heaven
that is somewhere else.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:84%

as far as how we understand

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:10%
disabilities is the fact that
this is not the only life they

will have, and that it's
possible to do things now which

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:10%
will give them the possibility
to have a future incarnation

So that's the one
thing, but I think

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:30.590 align:middle line:84%
the another thing is
that through our efforts

people call abnormality,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:84%

stand in front of
the blackboard,

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and I have a piece of chalk.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I ask people to say,
what's a human being?

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And they go through all
the list of the speaking

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and walking and thinking and
standing and on and on and on.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And I say, very well.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And then I start erasing.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Are they still a human being?

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Is this still a human being?

And gradually
taking things away,

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and of course,
people are left a bit

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:84%
stunned to realize that even
without many, many qualities,

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:22.140 align:middle line:90%
a human being is a human being.

have tended to
isolate themselves

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.190 align:middle line:84%
from the world at large, and
whether Steiner's legacy all

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:84%
together has become
too exclusive.

don't know that it's specific

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
isolation tends

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to happen with any
sort of content that

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.690 align:middle line:90%
comes into the world.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:22.180 align:middle line:10%

say it was his intention.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, you know,
I can say it seems

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.510 align:middle line:10%
in the biography
of this community

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:10%
that there was a time in
the growth of the community

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:10%
that it seemed really important
that it more or less separated

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.620 align:middle line:10%
off a little bit in order to
grow and to become strong.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe that
also can be reflected

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:84%
in the individual
as an inner process,

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.230 align:middle line:84%

with one's self.

But I certainly feel
like in this community,

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:84%

aiming to recreate some of
the early developmental stages

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that many of the students have
missed, and in a situation

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:84%
where the role model of
the adult is crucial.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't get
too close to that,

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.860 align:middle line:84%
because smaller fish
might swim down there.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't throw it too close to
the side, because otherwise it

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.658 align:middle line:84%
gets caught in all
the rocks, and then it

00:43:46.658 --> 00:43:49.120 align:middle line:90%
causes disease and bacteria.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%

Pollution, stress, illness--
everyone, not just the young,

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:19.060 align:middle line:90%
is in need of help.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.870 align:middle line:84%
How can we muster inner
forces in the healing process,

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:84%
or simply cope with the
pressures of modern life?

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.950 align:middle line:84%
An ally in this
challenge is Weleda UK,

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:33.280 align:middle line:84%
here on the outskirts of
Ilkeston in Derbyshire.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Founded in 1921 as a
result of Steiner's contact

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.250 align:middle line:84%
with the medical
profession, Weleda

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is now a worldwide organization
providing medicines

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that stimulate our natural
capacity to heal ourselves

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.720 align:middle line:90%
and to remain healthy.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It also creates products
which, in Weleda's words,

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:58.060 align:middle line:84%
restore harmony and
enhance well being.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Alongside its modern and
efficient production line,

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:84%
many of the substances are
potentized by hand, enhancing,

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.910 align:middle line:84%
so they believe, the
efficacy of the medicines.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:84%
The managing director
is Bob Ballard.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.140 align:middle line:10%
>> I think there's a
general disillusionment with

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:24.240 align:middle line:10%
the one-size-fits-all
standardization, normalization.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.890 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:84%
There's so many side
effects with a lot

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.670 align:middle line:90%
of the conventional medicines.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Not all, but there's a lot
of side effects because

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:84%
of this one-dimensional view of
the human being as a machine.

And if something
breaks, you just

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:48.970 align:middle line:84%
fix it, without
a total awareness

on the rest of the body,

00:45:53.836 --> 00:45:54.850 align:middle line:90%

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The plants that are
used in the majority

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:06.102 align:middle line:84%
of Weleda's remedies are grown
in their own biodynamic garden.

00:46:06.102 --> 00:46:08.860 align:middle line:84%
The space is deliberately
not all geared

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to production, but to
the health and diversity

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.585 align:middle line:90%
of the environment as a whole--

00:46:13.585 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:90%
a pond, meadow, and trees.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.760 align:middle line:84%
For Michael Bate and his
assistant Claire Hattersley,

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.450 align:middle line:84%
the plants, all plants, mirror
aspects of the human being,

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and, if recognized, are there
to restore balance and to heal.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The medicines which Rudolf
Steiner himself gave us are

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.890 align:middle line:90%
very fascinating.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.750 align:middle line:10%
And when you really study
the growth and gestures

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.720 align:middle line:10%
of the plants that
he suggested, they

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:10%
can provide this picture, often,
of the healthy working of, say,

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.470 align:middle line:10%
the heart or the
liver or whatever.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Or, on the other
hand, provide a mirror

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of how that organ or
that system doesn't work.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> This commitment to ponder
deeply on Steiner's sometimes

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:12.360 align:middle line:84%
challenging indications about
our relationship to nature

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and to our interconnectedness
with nature,

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and to observe what the
plant is saying to us,

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.840 align:middle line:84%
is at the heart
of Weleda's work.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Michael also spoke to
me about the challenge

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:29.010 align:middle line:84%
of being as fluid and
flexible as nature herself,

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize that
everything, including

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.680 align:middle line:90%
our own lives, is in process.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is fixed.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And like each one
of us, every plant

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.740 align:middle line:90%
has its own unique signature.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.100 align:middle line:84%
The uniqueness of each
human being, their health

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and well-being, are a prime
concern of the Blackthorne

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Medical Centre at
Maidstone in Kent,

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.180 align:middle line:84%
an NHS practice that combines
conventional medicine

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.900 align:middle line:84%
with an anthroposophical
approach to health and healing.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It also offers
therapies that include

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:07.280 align:middle line:84%
eurythmy, biographical
counseling, rhythmic massage,

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.210 align:middle line:90%
and art.

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:11.640 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the
Blackthorne Trust

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.690 align:middle line:84%
has a contract with social
services for the rehabilitation

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:19.230 align:middle line:84%
of patients with mental
health problems through work

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:23.575 align:middle line:84%
in Blackthorne's garden, bakery,
cafe, and craft workshop.

00:48:23.575 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.220 align:middle line:84%
The practice also
has NHS funding

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.590 align:middle line:84%

pain management.

feel themselves at
the end of the road.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes only then
can the healing begin.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.100 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's what
we have to do,

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.250 align:middle line:10%
and that's what
it's such fun doing,

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:53.250 align:middle line:10%
because the human being
is so resourceful.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.800 align:middle line:90%
There is so much talent there.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:84%
People come in feeling
that they are so shallow.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.957 align:middle line:84%
They come and feeling that they
are nobody, because of the way

00:49:03.957 --> 00:49:06.540 align:middle line:84%
they've been treated, because
of the way they've been reduced,

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.882 align:middle line:84%
because they have nothing
now in terms of income.

00:49:08.882 --> 00:49:09.840 align:middle line:90%
They've lost their car.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.040 align:middle line:90%
They're on benefits.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.440 align:middle line:90%
They feel they're that big.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.250 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea, until
they start working,

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:90%
of the depths of their humanity.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Others see it.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Those who love them see it.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.100 align:middle line:84%
But they've lost
the sense of that.

And the latest plan, because we
have plans every two or three

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.990 align:middle line:84%
years, is that the money
will now go to doctors,

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and we will have all the money.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.372 align:middle line:90%

is one of the very few,

00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:24.810 align:middle line:84%
if not the only medicine,
that can take patients

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:28.620 align:middle line:84%
into independence, because
we recognize the presence

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.775 align:middle line:90%

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and was a co-founder of
the Vidar Clinic in Jarna.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I asked her what she
felt was Steiner's most

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.930 align:middle line:84%
significant contribution
to medicine.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very much, maybe the
most important thing is that

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:26.360 align:middle line:10%
you need to integrate every
illness into the biography

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.220 align:middle line:10%
of a human being.

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It means the illness
has a context,

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and that has big
moral consequences.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to treat
everybody individually.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.100 align:middle line:90%
You have to listen to everybody.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:48.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to find out what is the
possibility in this situation

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:90%
for the individual patient.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is the
strongest thing.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.470 align:middle line:84%
That inspired me most,
and really deeply changed

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:03.980 align:middle line:84%
my relationship to the patients
and my decision making.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So each person
has a story in a way,

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.230 align:middle line:90%
that's what you're saying?

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And the story is sometimes
a secret story, even

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.750 align:middle line:90%
for the patient.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:18.280 align:middle line:90%
So when you get ill, something--

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like a secret.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.580 align:middle line:84%
There's something in it that
we both have to find out.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:26.090 align:middle line:90%

also runs regular courses
in anthroposophic medicine

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:38.630 align:middle line:84%
for doctors in the UK and in
India and the Philippines.

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I think what's unique about
Steiner's contribution is that,

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.820 align:middle line:10%
on the one hand, he fully
recognized what conventional

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:10%
medicine was offering
as a detailed knowledge

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.450 align:middle line:10%
of the physical body,
but made it very clear,

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:57.530 align:middle line:10%
and almost challenged doctors
to think beyond the box,

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.520 align:middle line:10%
and to be aware that the
human being has life forces,

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:07.100 align:middle line:10%
has a soul, has a
spiritual identity,

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.370 align:middle line:10%
and that all that is
part of being human,

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:13.970 align:middle line:10%
and really all that is involved
in the process of becoming ill,

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:22.970 align:middle line:10%
and potentially can be mobilized
in the healing process.

>> Carina Zeller
is from Argentina,

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and works as a doctor in Chile.

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I was always very
interested in spirituality.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:37.400 align:middle line:10%
And I had the experience,
both the science

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and the spirituality are truth.

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And both are truth, but
I can't find the bridge.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And there has to be a bridge.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Science and spirituality.

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because I was always
very interested in science,

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:56.480 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was searching,
looking for the bridge,

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't find it.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And I read a book of Rudolf
Steiner in [INAUDIBLE],,

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and I said, here is the
bridge that I'm looking for.

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you optimistic about
the future and medicine?

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that people
have said about anthroposophic

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.810 align:middle line:84%
medicine is that it is
the medicine for tomorrow.

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect it's the medicine
for the day after tomorrow.

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So it needs really
the long view.

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm optimistic in the long
view, not quite so optimistic

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:48.700 align:middle line:90%
in the short term.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see an element of
tragedy in Steiner's life--

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.530 align:middle line:84%
the fact that he
did die quite early?

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Certainly I think the whole
life is, from one point of view,

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.200 align:middle line:90%
is a tragedy.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:09.046 align:middle line:84%
I think he was
suffering a very lot.

00:55:09.046 --> 00:55:09.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Because?

00:55:09.846 --> 00:55:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think his insights
were so far reaching that he

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:25.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't meet enough people
to understand quick enough.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But from another
point of view, you

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:31.960 align:middle line:84%
can say love is
always a tragedy.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.910 align:middle line:84%
You come with
something really new.

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It was really an impulse
of love, I think.

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:43.150 align:middle line:90%
So it must fail in a way.

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:47.140 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, looks like
that, because he was not

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.700 align:middle line:90%
the big star.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.950 align:middle line:90%
He connected with people.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.430 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to work with people.

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:53.860 align:middle line:90%
He took them as they were.

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.390 align:middle line:84%
He was positive, and all
this very big social impulse

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:01.390 align:middle line:90%
is, it's great.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a little
bit more slow for him,

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:10.144 align:middle line:84%
but we all are invited to this,
and that is not a tragedy.

00:56:10.144 --> 00:56:11.185 align:middle line:90%
I think that's beautiful.

00:56:11.185 --> 00:56:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It takes some time, but it's
beautiful that he chose that.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.530 align:middle line:84%
He could have gone
to the mountains

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and wrote a lot of
wonderful books,

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.964 align:middle line:84%
but he chose to work
together with people.

00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's very great.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything
else that is so practical,

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that really tries to
create the culture

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:38.930 align:middle line:84%
from spiritual insights--
not only having them,

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:40.536 align:middle line:90%
but doing something.

00:56:40.536 --> 00:56:44.110 align:middle line:90%


00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But things are going much
slower than one would wish.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.525 align:middle line:84%
Even in me-- I'm too
slow, I'm too lazy.

00:56:52.525 --> 00:56:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Slowly but surely might
be one way to describe

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the progress of Rudolf Steiner's
legacy, not only in medicine,

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:11.720 align:middle line:90%
but in all areas of daily life.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:17.630 align:middle line:84%
He died nearly 100 years
ago on March 30, 1925.

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:19.880 align:middle line:84%
During his lifetime,
he frequently

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.600 align:middle line:84%
spoke about death, and in
particular about the bond that

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.810 align:middle line:84%
continues between
those of us on Earth

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and those who are no
longer physically present.

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that we
are open and aware of those

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:37.690 align:middle line:84%
we have known and loved,
so can they continue

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:40.240 align:middle line:90%
to help and inspire us.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And we in our turn can
communicate to them

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:46.330 align:middle line:84%
insights and experiences
that can only

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.160 align:middle line:90%
be learned in the here and now.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.330 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:56.020 align:middle line:84%
The essence of his
message as I understand

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.900 align:middle line:84%
it, a message that
tries to communicate

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.660 align:middle line:84%
ancient wisdom in
a form appropriate

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.010 align:middle line:84%
for modern consciousness, is
that there is only one world--

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:09.550 align:middle line:84%
part seemingly hidden,
part revealed--

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and that we human
beings are not alone,

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:16.510 align:middle line:84%
not just in our daily lives,
but in the universe at large.
