00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> April 2020, just as the world
was shutting down for the first

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:84%
time, an interesting documentary
called "Close Encounters

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Fifth Kind"
appeared online.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It claims that a group of
people have figured out

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.110 align:middle line:90%
how to make contact with UFOs.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.825 align:middle line:84%
And it promised to
teach you how to do it.

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, this mysterious
little movie was everywhere.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I've come to learn that the
way to make these interactions

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:10%
with these beings are by
expanding our consciousness.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So through meditation,
we actually

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:90%
can make contact a lot easier.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
And there's been so many times
where I've been meditating

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and I've looked up, and
there's something in the sky.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a documentary called
"Close Encounters of the Fifth

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:10%
Kind."

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:10%
I believe it's about
this organization that

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:10%
came out during quarantine that
goes out and does these, like,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:10%
circles where they call in UFOs.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.615 align:middle line:84%
And they have video of it and
all these different things.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Serena DC,
and I saw "Close Encounters

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Fifth Kind" the
second it came out.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I followed all of
the instructions.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough, I had my
own life-changing contact

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to learn more about
"Close Encounters of the Fifth

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:10%
Kind," CE5 for short.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:10%
So I reached out to
Dr. Steven Greer,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:10%
the man behind the
documentary and advocate

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:10%
for all of these radical ideas.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer granted me exclusive,
never-before-seen access

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to one of his advanced workshops
where he teaches his protocols.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:10%
So my team packed their
bags and headed straight

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:10%
for Oracle, Arizona.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.645 align:middle line:10%
This is what happened.

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:14.044 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.044 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
People from all around
the world travel

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
to these exclusive
retreats to meet Dr. Greer

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and to learn his
protocols for contacting

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
beings and craft.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
We sit down with a few of
the attendees in Oracle

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
to get their perspective
on learning and practicing

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
CE5 on Dr. Greer himself
and their expectations

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:90%
for the event.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm so excited about going to
Oracle because even though I've

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:10%
had my own CE5 experience, I
feel like being with Dr. Steven

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:10%
Greer, learning how to do
the protocols properly,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:10%
and being around a group of
people that are going to also

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:10%
be trying to communicate with
UFOs I might see something

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:10%
pretty amazing.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I had no expectations
coming to Oracle.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:10%
I was open to whatever
we're going to see.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:10%
I heard that some people
had individual experiences,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:10%
and there were other people
that had group experiences.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I just hoped we would
get to see something.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you hoping to see?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great question.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Personally, I don't
recommend having an expectation

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:10%
because then you're leaving
yourself for a place to be

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:10%
disappointed or let down.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't
have an expectation,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
then you come in with an
open mind and an open heart.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:10%
And what happens is
supposed to happen.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:10%
And you are left getting exactly
what you're supposed to get.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:10%
And that comes
from a better place

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:10%
of unknowing where you don't
know what is out there.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:10%
And when you're
expecting something else,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:10%
it's you're assuming
that what's out there.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been really interesting
to see the diverse group

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
of people that have been
attracted to this CE5 event.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.158 align:middle line:84%
I really thought most
people that came here

00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
would be a little bit
trippy, a little bit weird,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:90%
a little bit fringe like me.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
They're people from all
different walks of life.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
We've got CEOs from
major corporations,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and then we've got
the person that

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:90%
helps you to pump your gas.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
It's super diverse.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's really exciting.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm honored to be here, and
I'm honored to be at a time

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.585 align:middle line:90%
where we know CE5 is.

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
In the 1950s, you
had Roswell and you

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:84%
had all these unbelievable,
unexplained experiences

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:90%
but there was never--

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:90%
it was all top secret.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was thinking about making
contact or how to make contact.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:10%
Now here we are
in 2022, and we're

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:10%
thinking about how
can we come together

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:10%
and how can we make contact
and what's out there.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:10%
And so rather than
thinking about that there's

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:10%
something else out there
that's a threat to our humanity

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:10%
and that might want to
destroy us, well, maybe

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:10%
it's something that just wants
to teach us about ourselves

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:10%
and to teach us about love and
intergalactic love, whatever

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:10%
that looks like.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:10%
>> CE5, for me,
means big, broad,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:10%
exciting spectrum of
communication with all sorts

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness that
exists within us,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:10%
folded within us the spectrum
that we have is and my belief

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:10%
system we are multi-dimensional.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:10%
So there's that whole spectrum
that we have folded within us.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:10%
And then there is,
of course everything

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:10%
else in the universe,
which is so huge.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big term if you
look at it from that angle.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
But encapsulating it it's
really for me personally,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
it's the desire to
explore that and find

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
ways of communicating with
other types of consciousness.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The purpose of CE5 for me
is to think outside the box

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:10%
of what normal human
interaction is and to understand

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:10%
the consciousness and the
collective that's out there

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:10%
and to be able to put yourself
in a position of a calm state

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:10%
of mind where you're open and
your heart and your mind are

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:10%
open to exploring something else
that's beyond what our realm

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness currently is.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've seen some really
unexplainable bright lights,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:90%
geometric shapes.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
There's been all kinds of
out-of-nowhere shooting stars

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
that were bigger than
shooting stars, that

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.665 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be explained.

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
At first, we thought
they were meteor showers.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Somebody that was with me one
time, one of my dear friends

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
saw something the size
of a moon that was red.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:90%
There was a glowing orb.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And we were all sober.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We were all with an open
heart and an open mind,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and we saw things that
we could never explain

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and that when we weren't
doing CE5 we never saw.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the biggest
draws to Oracle,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.712 align:middle line:84%
Arizona for me was
the story of Ed Moen.

00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Ed Mon.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm from Mineral
Point, Wisconsin.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:10%
It was a very
emotional experience,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:10%
and it's kind of
emotional for me

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:10%
to be back here
after four years.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I left the CE5 at about
1 o'clock in the morning.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I felt this calling.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I went back out into the
desert after leaving the group

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and ran into this
extraterrestrial out

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:90%
in the desert.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And we connected, and
I invited it over.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And we hung out all night.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Had asked him for a
healing on my hearing

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
because I had this hearing
problem my whole life.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And it just occurred to
me that they were healers.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:90%
I could sense that.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.292 align:middle line:10%
So I said, "It seems
like you guys might

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:10%
be able to help me with this.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind doing something?"

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:90%
And I forgot about it.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I spent a whole night in the
desert playing hide and seek

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and going for walks with
this entity until sunrise.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I
should get some sleep

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and had to say,
goodnight or goodbye.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up the
next morning, and my--

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
I could hear everyone.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was quite an experience.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect that to
happen at all coming here.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Ed is completely healed.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to
him here in Oracle,

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Arizona literally
changed his life forever.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Coming to Oracle, doing a
CE5 with Dr. Steven Greer

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
gave him his hearing back
and changed his entire life.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Seeing things in
the sky is one thing,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
but having an entity like that
with that kind of vibration

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:90%
standing right next to you is--

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:90%
it was just highly emotional.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:90%
It was really high energy.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Being that close to that kind
of presence got my attention.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
They're really a
loving, sweet beings.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:10%
>> So I finally had the
opportunity to sit down with

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Steven Greer.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing
I wanted to know

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.917 align:middle line:10%
is, what can we expect
on one of these retreats?

00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Some people think they're going
to go and do the CE5 protocols

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and a massive flying saucer
is going to appear and land

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:84%
ET is going to come out
and say, phone home.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.470 align:middle line:90%
But initially when--

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, it does sometimes

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, but 99 out of
100, it's not going to happen.

00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think it would
be really great

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.142 align:middle line:84%
if you could just explain
a little bit about what

00:10:12.142 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:90%
people can expect.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:90%
What's typical?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It runs the gamut.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it goes from
just people having

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
an experience in consciousness
to hearing a tone come through.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So not necessarily
seeing anything,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:90%
but seeing it in the minds?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, remember primacy, I
say, is with consciousness.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:10%
The consciousness
field is reality.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:10%
And as the Vedas say,
"All this is that."

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:10%
All that you see is
actually consciousness

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:10%
resonating and phasing
as that light or a photon

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:10%
or a star or a tree.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:10%
And this gets into
a deep understanding

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:10%
of the science of
consciousness and how

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:10%
it integrates into the
physical world and science.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, we're
dealing with civilizations

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:84%
that have mastered
that because see,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:84%
we would have
already been decades

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:84%
into an era of mastering the
science of consciousness had we

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
not been delayed hundreds years
by the industrial fascists that

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:84%
have kept the fundamental
sciences secret.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And kept
everybody distracted.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we're catching up here
we're trying to catch up before

00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
it's too late, to
be honest with you.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of
things that can happen.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:90%
One time we had a team--

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.258 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't there-- out
in West Virginia.

00:11:27.258 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And it had been cloudy and
rainy like it is on the East

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Coast so much of the time.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were ready to leave
and they were going, "Oh, we

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:90%
wish we had seen ET."

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The clouds parted, and a
cloud formed the letters ET

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, no,
right up there huge.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.755 align:middle line:90%
And people go, "Really?"

00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I go, "Yeah, weird stuff like
that happens all the time."

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was mysterious
but beautiful.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And so for whatever reason,
they couldn't come in 3D,

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
but they did that.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
They have a sense
of humor for sure.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they're very funny.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:90%
They're very funny.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think, they're
extremely smart.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.236 align:middle line:84%
And I think bright
people are funny.

00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:11.827 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:11.827 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>> You could see anything.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%
It could be a light.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.840 align:middle line:10%
It could be a light doing
some geometrical shapes.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:10%
It could just blink.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we never know.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:10%
>> When they prep you for
like coming to this event,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:10%
they like really specify
not having those kinds

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:10%
of expectations, but what
expectations not to have about

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:10%
the whole evil alien and kind
of expecting the ETs to perform

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:10%
like there in SeaWorld
or something like that.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I came to the retreat to
further the work of contact

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:48.210 align:middle line:84%
with ETs, further my own ability
to make contact with them

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that engaged
contact is going to shift

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:84%
consciousness more than
doing it by ourselves.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they want to help
mankind as much as they can.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think with all
the negativity in the world,

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
they're ready to just--

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
they've already evolved
way past any of the things

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:90%
that we're going through.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:10%
>> The ETs are here to help us.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:10%
They are not here to hurt us.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:10%
And so that is their agenda.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.817 align:middle line:84%
And they want to help
us to become actually

00:13:24.817 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
a civilization instead
of an uncivilized planet.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, we need
to raise our vibration.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're helping
us to do that.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite surprised how
deeply they are helping us.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It just boggles the mind how
much they are doing to help.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:10%
>> For me, CE5 has enriched
my life by allowing me

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:10%
to understand that we're not
the only thing that's out there,

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:10%
and there's a lot more.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's not
a national threat.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.132 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something
that's positive.

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something
that's full of love.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.215 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's another
level of consciousness and love

00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't even
achieved or felt yet.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So the recurring theme that
I keep hearing over and over

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
again, when I talk to Dr. Steven
Greer and all of the people

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that have gone to this
CE5 retreat is that these

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials are
not here to harm us.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're
here to help us.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:10%
>> So my understanding of
the necessary parameters

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:10%
and the human domain or context
in order to establish contact

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:10%
is from a frequency
perspective, again,

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:10%
using that model of an
accordion, if you like.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Here's the physical.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Here's the one, if you like, or
the omnipresent consciousness.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And through there there's many
phases of consciousness itself.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We're quite locked as a species
right now into the tangible.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
But we need to drop that
when we approach something

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that we know absolutely
nothing about or very, very

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
little about and embrace
the value of not knowing.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:10%
So it is a limitation
of us when we put things

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:10%
into little cognitive
cupboards really quickly

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:10%
and we say, I've
experienced this

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:10%
and they're from this
planet, and that's done

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:10%
and I'll put it over there.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's quite
a severe limitation

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.070 align:middle line:84%
on a context that is
infinite essentially.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have to move beyond
the physicality of things

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and look at it from a
point of not knowing.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:10%
>> We've been talking about
the foundational element level

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:10%
of the cosmos is the unbounded,
undifferentiated pure conscious

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.750 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's infinite.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It has no beginning
in space and time.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:90%
It is indivisible.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:90%
It is a singularity.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we are all awake.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:10%
So it's like a ray of
that infinite aspect

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:10%
is what enables us to be
conscious and sentient.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And the meditative state is to
basically experience that mind

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.400 align:middle line:84%
as it then becomes
expanded in this state.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you experience it in this
state, it's the samadhi state.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's that state of
boundlessness and bliss

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and being that you
all have heard about.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:10%
And of course, many of you
have experienced periodically.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:10%
When I talk about this resonant
realm of thought, sound,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:10%
the primal or
initiating emanation

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:10%
from the plane of the
absolute is actually

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:10%
what's called the primal
thought of the great being.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
That is that first impulse
from absolute nothingness

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to the absolute fullness
of pure consciousness

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:90%
as it manifests into relativity.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
That primal thought,
initial thought sound

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:90%
is unbelievably beautiful.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced it a few times.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
And it has within it
every infinite possibility

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
of any other sound
resonance frequency

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
thought that would be within a
star or your body or the carpet

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
or that house or the rock.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:10%
All of it has tonality
associated with it

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:10%
even at the most expressed
three-dimensional level.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can go from
fully external,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
call it, aspect It's how you're
perceiving it of the quantum

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:84%
hologram of cosmology
of say your body

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and your individuality or
gazing at a blade of grass.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And every blade of
grass has within it

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
this tonality of that
unique thing, the signature.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
a sound component

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
of thought within
the blade of grass.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
it differentiates

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
into the so-called
astral subtle light

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
energy that's within the blade
of grass, and then from there

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:84%
into 3D biological
material expression.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
You can go therefore
from anything

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
contemplate and go

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
straight deeper and
deeper in your perception

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.130 align:middle line:84%
until you actually
experience the primal thought

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and transcend into
the unbounded ocean.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So it can go from outward
in or from inward out.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The creative aspect, the
way existence comes out

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:90%
of nothingness is this.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So as the sun began to set,
the team of CE5ers and Dr.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer headed up Oracle's
Hill, set up their chairs,

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:90%
and got comfortable.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Then Dr. Greer began
to lead everyone

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:84%
through the CE5 protocols,
the first of which

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:90%
was a guided meditation.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:10%
>> So let us close our eyes.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:10%
And let's take
some deep breaths.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:53.945 align:middle line:10%
Sitting quietly, enjoy the
peace of this sacred place.

00:19:53.945 --> 00:19:56.912 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.912 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And breathe in with your nose
deeply the revivifying breath

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:90%
of Mother Earth.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And see yourself
awakened and energized

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
through the prana and
the qi, the life force.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale,
relax from the toes

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.435 align:middle line:90%
to the top of your head.

00:20:26.435 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We feel our bodies filled
with light and energy

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.515 align:middle line:84%
and our awareness
expanding and clear.

00:20:38.515 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And as we exhale, we let
go of all of our concerns,

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:54.175 align:middle line:84%
all stress, all worries, and
settle into that great peace

00:20:54.175 --> 00:20:54.975 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:20:54.975 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And see that the conscious
mind never changes.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
It is always a pure
unbounded light of awareness.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Your perceptions change.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:26.035 align:middle line:84%
The field of consciousness
is changeless and one.

00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that
all that exists

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:84%
is pure consciousness
resonating in various densities,

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:46.545 align:middle line:84%
frequencies into whatever
that object or person is.

00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But the conscious mind
itself we can experience

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.565 align:middle line:90%
in its pure unbounded form.

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> What I experience--

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.285 align:middle line:84%
it's like if you
think of the heart's

00:22:05.285 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
bio-electromagnetic
field, it resonates

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:90%
at a certain frequency.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we are in a state
of unity consciousness,

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.530 align:middle line:84%
we're in a state of gratitude,
when we are in a state of one

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves and with
others and we really

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
embody that, through the
consciousness spectrum

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.460 align:middle line:90%
we're uplifting.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:90%
We're resonating high vibes.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
makes it easier

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:84%
for these highly advanced,
highly intelligent

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
empathic beings to
bond, to resonate

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:90%
with our electromagnetic field.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
they can simply

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
convey huge amounts
of information.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, all my life I knew
there were ETs out there,

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:10%
my entire life ever
since I was a little boy.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:10%
But everything I
looked at in the media

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:10%
was all I knew
that wasn't right.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:10%
And I really had a hard
time finding that right path

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:10%
that I knew inside internally.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
When I found Dr. Greer I said,
this is a no-mess-around guy.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
This is different from all the
mainstream that's out there.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:10%
I knew I was in the right place.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:10%
I almost feel like there
was a divine ET just helping

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:10%
me connect to you
because I was searching

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:10%
for you my whole life since I
was probably seven years old.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:10%
And finally, I got
what it really is not

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:10%
what the mainstream puts it as.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
was genuine truth.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
After that, I went in to
one of your expeditions

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:90%
in Oracle and in Joshua Tree.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:10%
And there, I realized that
through my inner peace

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:10%
inside of me, this is where
I would speak to the ETs

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:10%
out there.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't about getting
a picture of a craft

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:10%
or seeing a UFO land.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:10%
It was everything
internally inside.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:10%
And it was just wired in me.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And that first day we were
in circle, it was amazing.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't see anything.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And I was OK with that.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.638 align:middle line:84%
I had someone
sitting next to me.

00:24:08.638 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:90%
He was probably in his mid 70s.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And he told me,
"Ignacio, I really

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
don't expect to see
anything out here this week.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is
a waste of my time."

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Oh, OK."

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So second, third day what
happens in these groups

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:84%
is there's a cohesive-- there's
a coherence between a bond,

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:90%
between the group.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And when there's a love
and a connection there,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.832 align:middle line:84%
it almost just enhances
the part of making contact

00:24:34.832 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:90%
because we're together.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:90%
We're one.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
There's like a fine love
there between all of us.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And it was the first time I
saw an ET in my entire life

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.440 align:middle line:10%
with my physical eyes.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:10%
Here I am on the
third day, and you're

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:10%
telling us do not be afraid,
welcome them, thank them

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:10%
for coming.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:10%
And here we have on my left
side on the third night

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:10%
an orb coming out from
underneath the ground.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's just hovering
nice and slow.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, wow,
that's interesting.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen a car do that.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought there was
a road back there.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And it started getting
bigger and bigger.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And it came up to about maybe
3 feet in the air I'm like,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:90%
that's nice.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I kept turning
and you were here,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and the orb kept
coming over here.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.785 align:middle line:84%
And it started
coming towards me.

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
And started getting bigger.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
pulsating almost

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
like an orange-yellowish
light and just slowly

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:90%
coming towards me.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, shit.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:10%
And I started getting
scared inside.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:10%
And you warned us
about this when

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:10%
we were in the meditation
section of the retreat.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.860 align:middle line:10%
And then the orb started kind
of going away little by little

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:10%
as I was getting afraid.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:52.228 align:middle line:10%
And I realized, oh my God,
this is actually happening.

00:25:52.228 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:10%
And then it started coming
back up through the mountain

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:10%
again and coming
closer and closer.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And then as it got closer,
I could feel just a love,

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:05.960 align:middle line:90%
a sense of oneness with them.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:10%
And it was so powerful.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:10%
And then it slowly went
back down to the ground.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:10%
And then there I
knew it was going

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:10%
to be an amazing, amazing week.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Hearing these stories
has been so inspiring for me

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
because I really thought it was
just all about seeing a couple

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of lights in the
sky, but it's not.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.450 align:middle line:84%
These people are having
massive telepathic experiences.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:90%
They're going up into craft.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.980 align:middle line:84%
They're having communications
with extraterrestrials.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:90%
This is a really huge deal.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll be very surprised
at how easy it is to connect.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And once that connection
is established,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.580 align:middle line:84%
it only gets better and
better and better and better.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It becomes so eloquent and so
sophisticated and so highly

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
specialized and intelligent that
you know it's-- and it's always

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:90%
within the spectrum of unity.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
time contact occurs.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
If there's fear or division,
they just they won't interact.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But if there's the
context of unity is there,

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.670 align:middle line:84%
it just keeps on getting
closer and more intimate.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Beings, lights will come
right into your home,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and it will just be
absolutely incredible.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:10%
>> There was one time
we were in Denver,

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:10%
and I had this train of thoughts
in my head realizing that we

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:10%
need to take responsibility
and we have to be the primary

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:10%
movers.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:90%
But it starts with us as people.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And they will help,
they will assist,

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and they will support us.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
the primary movers.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when we were
meditating, I opened my eyes.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I turned to my right, and
there's this golden craft that

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:90%
was like fading in and out.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back
into meditative state.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And then after the meditation,
I shared with the group.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And I took the laser, and I
was pointing towards the craft.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And then where I saw the
craft, and all of a sudden,

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:90%
it manifested again.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it was
very encouraging to know

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:90%
that they will always--

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:90%
they are here to support us.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's not their job to do.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
We have to be the
primary movers,

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and then they will
support our endeavor.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And we share the same
vision for the planet.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we have in common.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And we are a team.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you think that
vision is that we're sharing?

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> To create the world
that's loving and peaceful

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and abundant and to
become interstellar.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the most exciting part.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait for that.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's such a humbling but
also empowering and inspiring

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:84%
perspective to hear the
fact that we do need to take

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:06.870 align:middle line:90%
the first step.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:11.225 align:middle line:84%
But when we do, they're
going to be there to help us.

00:29:11.225 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> This work has
only just begun.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's this little
doorway Dr. Greer is just

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:90%
kind of open for us.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to go
like that and just

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
expand out so that
everybody can walk through.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe our future is
an interstellar future.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to fast track that
peace, unified energy in terms

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
of abundance and
production on our planet

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and then interstellar
civilizations.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And this motion of we
welcome you and I'd

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:55.750 align:middle line:84%
like to visit your planet
too, that's so exciting to me.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think, it is
for a lot of people.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you're listening
to this and this is--

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
this as I was driving up

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:84%
from Charlottesville, probably
the most important thing

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd say amongst all of this
deluge of verbs and adjectives

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:84%
is that if you're resonating
with that thought,

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
then put the
protocols to practice.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Go out in the field,
test them out.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.730 align:middle line:90%
See what responses you get.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So I wanted to learn more
about how all this is possible

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:90%
from a scientific perspective.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Dr. Greer, to what
extent do scientists understand

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:90%
this phenomenon?

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:43.080 align:middle line:10%
>> In the '70s and forward,
really good scientific studies

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:10%
were done on the effect
of consciousness remotely.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So everyone thinks that
the consciousness whereby

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.560 align:middle line:84%
you and I are awake are
two separate things.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
field is a singularity.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There's one consciousness
field in the creation.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just illuminating each
of our individualities.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:84%
The meditation is the process
of going deep and experiencing

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.800 align:middle line:84%
that point of all
light, the source.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's that state
and that's very much

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:84%
an unbounded, undifferentiated
field of consciousness.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:90%
And it is infinite.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's eternal, and all
those things you always hear.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you're doing
something in higher states

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
and meditation, it

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:84%
isn't just having a linear
effect 1 and 1 and 1.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.910 align:middle line:90%
It's an exponential effect.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And they have found
that, for example,

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:84%
if a city of 200,000 people
has 2,000 people going

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:84%
into meditating for a week
or two, crime rates go down,

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:84%
violence goes down, emergency
department visits go down.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And these studies
have been sustained.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
that even the people who

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:84%
don't know those
meditators are in town

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.560 align:middle line:84%
are affected by that field
of consciousness effect.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.937 align:middle line:90%
So when enough people--

00:32:04.937 --> 00:32:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that's cool.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where the
magic and power in this is.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to get clarity here.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.970 align:middle line:10%
We're talking not
about what you're

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:10%
aware of but the essence
of conscious mind itself.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.430 align:middle line:84%
That is a little
abstract for people.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Essence of
conscious mind itself.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go
one deeper for me.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell people, it's
sort of a Zen process here.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
You're hearing my voice, and
you have your individuality

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.770 align:middle line:90%
and I have mine.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And you're awake, and I'm awake.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But the awareness
itself is a singularity.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:90%
It's one field.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.315 align:middle line:84%
Now we trap it in our
egos and our intellect.

00:32:46.315 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is different
than thought, isn't it?

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.523 align:middle line:84%
It's what I'm thinking is
different from the fact that--

00:32:50.523 --> 00:32:51.323 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:32:51.323 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:84%
The thought emerges from
the consciousness field.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking
about the deepest

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.980 align:middle line:90%
level of quiet conscious mind.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This is why the father of
quantum mechanics and particle

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:84%
wave theory Erwin
Schrödinger said,

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:07.320 align:middle line:84%
"The total number of minds
in the universe is one.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a singularity."

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a quantum physicist.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.190 align:middle line:10%
So this has been pretty well
established scientifically.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And the work of Dr.
Jon at Princeton,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:84%
where he would put people
in front of random number

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
generators just spitting
out zeros and ones

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:24.730 align:middle line:90%
quantum machines.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And when they put
their awareness on it

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and say we want it to put
out more zeros, it does.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And if there are two people
that love each other,

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.450 align:middle line:90%
it's exponential.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So there are amazing
scientific studies

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
about this effect of
consciousness of just intending

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:41.900 align:middle line:90%
with the consciousness.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So then imagine if thousands
or millions of people

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:90%
are doing something like this.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It can actually cause a
huge shift in civilization

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
by people who don't even
know you're doing it.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Now in the ancient
times and the Sanskrit

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and the Vedas in India,
which by the way, are not--

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.180 align:middle line:84%
they predate Hinduism
and Buddhism.

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
They're very ancient
philosophical books.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had been a student
of that since I was 18.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:14.889 align:middle line:10%
And what you find is when
people understand consciousness

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:10%
at this level, they can then
have all kinds of abilities

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:22.030 align:middle line:10%
that unfold, such as being
able to see the future,

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:10%
communicate telepathically,
telekinesis, lift

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:10%
things with your thought,
et cetera, and so on.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:90%
So these are known as siddhis--

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:90%
S-I-D-D-H-I-S.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of people over
the millennia of human history

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.880 align:middle line:84%
have had experiences
in deep consciousness

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly found
themselves levitating

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.889 align:middle line:84%
or found themselves doing
something extraordinary that

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be possible.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're discovering
that the reason for that

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
is that this consciousness field
is integrated in its fullness

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.030 align:middle line:84%
at every point in
space and time.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a deep
state of consciousness,

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
you can affect a camera or
you can affect a remote place.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Someone can be healed
by a group of people

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.880 align:middle line:84%
praying and meditating
them from afar.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It is so mind blowing to
think that we're all connected

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:90%
by consciousness.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And as we got deeper and
deeper into exploring the CE5

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
protocols, I could
actually start

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to feel this collective
consciousness that Dr. Greer

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.790 align:middle line:90%
had been telling us about.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Now let us affirm that the
mantra can gently be repeated

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:43.900 align:middle line:10%
like a tone, a song in the back
of our awareness as we become

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:10%
aware of pure consciousness
this ocean of mind that has been

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.465 align:middle line:10%
observing the mantra.

00:35:52.465 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And as we observe
the mantra, let

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:84%
us create an Astro
vehicle in which we

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:90%
can explore the cosmos.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And the mantra
through his tonality

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:23.250 align:middle line:84%
makes a perfect
equilateral triangle.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And as we repeat
it three times, it

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:84%
will make a tetrahedron,
a three-dimensional object

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.700 align:middle line:84%
with a triangle on each
side and a triangular base.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that together.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
(CHANTING) And see this
beautiful golden triangle,

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:84%
a tetrahedron, a
sacred form made

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:90%
of the vibration of the mantra.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.740 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And now let's repeat the
mantra three more times

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and make another
tetrahedron joined

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.320 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the first one.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:90%
(CHANTING)

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:37.186 align:middle line:84%
And now let's rotate
these two tetrahedrons

00:37:37.186 --> 00:37:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and merge them Halfway
within each other.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.855 align:middle line:84%
And we will see we have an
eight-pointed Merkabah--

00:37:44.855 --> 00:37:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:84%
spherical object
with eight points

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:84%
made up of two
perfect tetrahedrons.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:59.160 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And now let us put our awareness
in the center of this Merkabah,

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.265 align:middle line:90%
this double tetrahedral shape.

00:38:08.265 --> 00:38:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And as we rest our
consciousness all together in it

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
we see it creates a zone
of peace and safety,

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:84%
our own astral
vehicle that we can

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:36.410 align:middle line:84%
center our awareness within and
travel throughout the cosmos

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:90%
and throughout other dimensions.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And so let all of us together
now see this Merkabah

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and expand it.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And as it grows in size,
all of us fit within it.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of our pure
conscious minds

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:84%
become the one that
they really are.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And thus we are one mind
moving through many people,

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.615 align:middle line:84%
the true nature
of conscious life.

00:39:16.615 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And in this state, we can
see and feel the awareness

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.931 align:middle line:90%
of everyone around us.

00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And while each person is
unique in its own creation

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and no two people or beings
in the cosmos are identical,

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
whereby we are awake,

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:55.230 align:middle line:84%
is a singularity one
mind through all people.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And thus with this eye
of oneness centered

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
within the Merkabah we
feel the love and the peace

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.035 align:middle line:90%
of being together.

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.785 align:middle line:90%
Before we are many, we are one.

00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:14.710 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:84%
In this state of peace
and enlightenment,

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:84%
we allow our minds to
expand the Merkabah.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And it spreads out over
the space around us

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and expands like a
crystal expanding.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are within it gazing
over the territory below.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it rises upward
into the sky above us

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.680 align:middle line:90%
with our awareness in it.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And we can scan the
countryside and the mountains

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and the desert or
wheresoever we wish to see.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.585 align:middle line:84%
And we see with the crystal
clear celestial vision.

00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So as we expand the
Merkabah, we allow

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.360 align:middle line:84%
it to envelop the entirety
of the space above this place

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.330 align:middle line:90%
or wherever you are.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can gaze back at
yourself and your team

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and their bodies sitting.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:90%


00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can just practice
seeing from above

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.080 align:middle line:84%
even while you were still
in your physical bodies.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And as you get a sense
or a glimpse of that,

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:03.750 align:middle line:84%
allow it now to expand
and rise into sky.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And Father Sky is
enveloping Mother Earth.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And in their union, they
have created humanity.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.210 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.460 align:middle line:10%
>> The second night, we were
really deep in meditation

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.505 align:middle line:10%
again, and everyone
started screaming.

00:42:18.505 --> 00:42:19.880 align:middle line:10%
And I opened my
eyes, and there's

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.920 align:middle line:10%
this bright orb above us.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.260 align:middle line:10%
And it was incredible.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.830 align:middle line:10%
It was my first sighting.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding of
their purpose in visiting us

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and being with us is that they
understand this upper spectrum

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.820 align:middle line:84%
They understand the
oneness of consciousness.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So they see aspects
of themselves in us.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And it hurts them to see what
we're doing to each other.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.790 align:middle line:90%
So we're humans.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:84%
We're currently in a
collective consensus

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of warfare of all sorts of
terrible, terrible things.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
We cannot relate to a
consciousness that is 100,000,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.085 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years more
advanced than us.

00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
them out there.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.520 align:middle line:84%
There has to be at the
edge of the universe.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Unless we look at things
from a non-human perspective,

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:90%
how do we do that?

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to
deconstruct what

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:25.060 align:middle line:84%
we think it means to be human
and move beyond this spectrum.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.510 align:middle line:10%
So we step up and we do
that through lucid dream

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:10%
experiences,
out-of-body experiences,

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.580 align:middle line:10%
near-death experiences, through
deep meditation, all sorts.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.200 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts
of modalities where

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.950 align:middle line:84%
we can extend into
these other parameters

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and actually just
remove these limitations

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of a paradigm that's been
around for far too long.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's been proven not to work
over and over and over again.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.480 align:middle line:84%
All of humanity is, like
the mouse on the wheel

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
right now are going,
"When's it going to change?"

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, just
get off the wheel.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It really makes me pause and
think about my own relationship

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:84%
with nature and the role that I
have personally played in this

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:90%
cycle of destruction.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that got
me so excited about CE5

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing the phenomena
were these amazing photos

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Greer had
started publishing.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:84%
These photos showed
me that it wasn't

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:84%
about seeing flying saucers
or orbs floating in the sky.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.080 align:middle line:84%
It was about the
beings themselves

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.060 align:middle line:90%
who were occupying the craft.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.710 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a nice scope on it,
and it turned and curved towards

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:90%
this object.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.510 align:middle line:84%
That was not a
meteorite or meteor.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.300 align:middle line:90%
It came in and curved to this.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.200 align:middle line:90%
That just turned red by the way.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.690 align:middle line:84%
If there is
monitoring of the area

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:84%
by intelligence
or military, they

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:08.940 align:middle line:84%
could be hovering right
outside the circle of people.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't be
visible to the naked eye.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, these
new digital cameras

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.070 align:middle line:84%
with their CCDs or white
cells will pick them up

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:17.900 align:middle line:84%
if you have the right
settings turned on.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.827 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Justice from
Arlington, Texas.

00:45:19.827 --> 00:45:22.160 align:middle line:84%
During the expeditions, I'll
do a lot of the photography

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and the satellite charts.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take pictures
at the CE5 events.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And those pictures will end up
being 3,000 pictures a night

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.510 align:middle line:90%
sometimes that we take.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:middle line:10%
And we try to cover
as much of the sky

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.910 align:middle line:10%
as possible, as much of the
time as possible constantly

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:10%
shooting every 10
seconds a photo.

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what
we're learning to do.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I call it transdimensional
photography and videography.

>> As we continued
our journey in Oracle,

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:84%
to better understand the
protocols and processes that

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.760 align:middle line:84%
are used to make contact,
we caught up with one of Dr.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Greer's team members Pat who is
often responsible for setting

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:49.970 align:middle line:84%
up one of the
consciousness-raising

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:54.530 align:middle line:84%

night when we're on these

00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:58.520 align:middle line:90%
expeditions.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a tablecloth.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a silk cloth
that goes on next.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:05.480 align:middle line:10%
Most of the pieces
that are on that table

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.140 align:middle line:10%
are brass because most
puja pieces are brass.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And they can be purchased
at any Indian grocery

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.440 align:middle line:90%
usually or an Indian store.

Dr. Greer has a picture
of the Ascended Masters.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:19.310 align:middle line:90%
We put that on the table.

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:20.900 align:middle line:90%
There's a candle.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.580 align:middle line:90%
There is incense.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We have rice, water,
sandalwood paste, which

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.520 align:middle line:90%
is basically sandalwood powder.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have a little piece
of camphor that is burned.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:34.220 align:middle line:90%
We also have a piece of fruit.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Greer likes to use orange.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And we have some flowers.

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.690 align:middle line:90%
And that is the puja table.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:84%
He has a very specific
way he wants that set up.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Each time, it's very,
very symmetrical.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a really an ancient
Sanskrit ceremony

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.980 align:middle line:90%
that really predates religions.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And so as we do the puja, we
are putting the intention out

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that the world will become the
world that we know it can be

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and that we've seen
in our vision--

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:15.110 align:middle line:84%
a world of enlightenment, a
world that is interstellar,

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.210 align:middle line:90%
and a world of peace.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There are these two photos
of transdimensional beings that

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.080 align:middle line:84%
actually appear over
the puja table when Dr.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Greer is doing his ceremony.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:84%

of the protocols.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.820 align:middle line:84%
There are three
protocols-- sound,

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.030 align:middle line:84%
which are the tones,
thought, which

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:23.320 align:middle line:84%
is meditation, and light,
which is the use of the laser.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.720 align:middle line:90%
The tones, he uses three tones--

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:84%
crop circle tones,
Fibonacci tones,

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.270 align:middle line:90%
and the CSETI logo tones.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:36.010 align:middle line:84%
We use a radio to transmit
these tones before we start.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And we also play
them for the group.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.550 align:middle line:90%
We play them over a loudspeaker.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:44.090 align:middle line:84%

these tones can be picked up

>> I've always struggled to
meditate because my life is

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:84%
very hectic, and I find even
the smallest thing quite

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:30.500 align:middle line:90%
distracting.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Normally when I'm looking
for meditations to listen to,

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll just go to YouTube
and find something random.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But what I found when
I actually started

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.580 align:middle line:84%
to listen to the meditations
that were in Dr. Greer's app

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.830 align:middle line:84%
was that I was
able to focus more.

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Somehow knowing that
he was such an expert

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:84%
at being able to contact ETs
and craft and have them appear

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.650 align:middle line:84%
helped me to be more
focused on the meditation

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and to tune out
everything around me.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure many of the people
that have watched your movies

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.980 align:middle line:84%
have either started
to dabble in CE5

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.470 align:middle line:84%
or they're really interested
about going and doing it.

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:09.042 align:middle line:84%
And I'm somebody that has gone
out there and given it a shot.

00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's been things
that have worked for me

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.830 align:middle line:90%
and things that did not.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.800 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I
have found has always

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.995 align:middle line:84%
brought on some sort of
siding has been doing,

00:52:18.995 --> 00:52:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
you describe it,

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:84%
but the reverse meditation
where you're in the Milky Way

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're going into your
solar system, open your eyes,

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.590 align:middle line:90%
there they are!

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:31.025 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So that's been
really great for me.

00:52:31.025 --> 00:52:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
lots of people do

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.942 align:middle line:84%
lots of different
types of protocols.

00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:35.440 align:middle line:90%
You created an app--

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> --for us mere mortals
to be able to, I guess,

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:41.100 align:middle line:90%
tap into what it is that you do.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But can you walk me through
a few of the things that

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.270 align:middle line:90%
are in the app now?

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:47.465 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the key
thing is, I think,

00:52:47.465 --> 00:52:49.590 align:middle line:10%
this is the most important
that most people don't--

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:50.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Bring it out.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:50.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.530 align:middle line:10%
And one that people
don't think about

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.510 align:middle line:10%
is: why are you doing this?

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sort of
philosophical purpose

00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:59.130 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that people who
do this because they

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.980 align:middle line:84%
want to be entertained
by seeing a UFO

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.790 align:middle line:84%
are usually disappointed because
these civilizations aren't

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.640 align:middle line:84%
interested in being
Dolphins at SeaWorld.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.310 align:middle line:10%
So I think it's like
that movie "The Right

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:17.760 align:middle line:10%
Stuff" about the space
program and John Glenn.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.450 align:middle line:10%
These civilizations want
people who are sincere,

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:23.827 align:middle line:10%
pure hearted, doing it
for the right reasons.

00:53:23.827 --> 00:53:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>> To raise the vibration of
everybody else around them.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're really wanting
to do something to help

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:90%
the situation.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.820 align:middle line:84%
We live in such a
narcissistic selfish society

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that has to be secondary
to a larger purpose greater

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:36.880 align:middle line:90%
than yourself.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.600 align:middle line:10%
So I think it has
to be something--

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.940 align:middle line:10%
and this I know very
unpopular in our society

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.710 align:middle line:10%
now because it sounds
so old fashioned.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:46.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think people really
need to be concerned

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
about something better than
their own aggrandizement

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and curiosity.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.590 align:middle line:90%
So that's really key.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.870 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it's the
pure-heartedness

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:57.570 align:middle line:10%
that someone approaches
this with that

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:10%
is deterministic much more
so than the protocols.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The app has so
much going on in it.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I went out
and did my first CE5,

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:10.110 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that I used
were the cricket-sounding tones

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and that worked for
me lights in the sky.

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But then when I
went out with Greer,

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:17.010 align:middle line:84%
it was a completely
different experience.

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was doing
a puja ceremony.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.680 align:middle line:90%
There was meditations.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.090 align:middle line:84%
There was all manner
of things going on.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:24.910 align:middle line:90%
So, what's going on in that app?

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Is it supposed to
mimic what happens

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.480 align:middle line:90%
when you go out with Greer or?

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so the idea was
that not everybody can go out

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.767 align:middle line:90%
on these retreats.

00:54:32.767 --> 00:54:33.850 align:middle line:90%
They sell out really fast.

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.230 align:middle line:90%
They're limited to 20 people.

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, they're so unattainable
for your average person

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.400 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So the app is trying--

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:44.230 align:middle line:84%
the app was designed
to give everyone

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.770 align:middle line:84%
all the tools they would
need to do this on their own,

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:51.310 align:middle line:84%
form their own groups, connect
with people who are locally.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.780 align:middle line:90%
It has guided meditations.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It's got the tones that you use.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Those tones were actually
captured in a crop circle.

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.780 align:middle line:90%
That's where they came from.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> There's the equipment list.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he said I guess, the
purpose of the tone is to help

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:10.250 align:middle line:84%
you to get onto the same mental
frequency as everybody else

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.050 align:middle line:90%
in the group.

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.415 align:middle line:90%
>> So that makes sense.

00:55:12.415 --> 00:55:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting
how you're explaining it

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:17.860 align:middle line:84%
to me now because if you
haven't been out with Dr. Greer,

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.610 align:middle line:84%
you literally don't
know what he does.

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't know the
sequence of events.

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So having this app really
does allow you to mimic that.

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first thing on
the list is assembling a team.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
connect with other people

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.790 align:middle line:90%
locally who have the app.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean by that?

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Like, how do you connect
with other people?

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole networking aspect
of the app where you can meet

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.930 align:middle line:84%
up with other people locally who
have the app and form your own

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:50.862 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:55:50.862 --> 00:55:52.195 align:middle line:90%
>> So like, if we go on it now--

00:55:52.195 --> 00:55:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, so there's our location.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.293 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, there's
like all these people

00:56:00.293 --> 00:56:01.210 align:middle line:90%
around that are like--

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:02.043 align:middle line:90%
>> All these people.

00:56:02.043 --> 00:56:03.535 align:middle line:90%
>> And they're-- who are they?

00:56:03.535 --> 00:56:06.307 align:middle line:84%
They're people that have the
app or they have registered as,

00:56:06.307 --> 00:56:07.390 align:middle line:90%
like, what does that mean?

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's just other
people who have the app and are

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.060 align:middle line:90%
interested in connecting.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:12.518 align:middle line:84%
>> So I can reach out to them
and message them and be like,

00:56:12.518 --> 00:56:15.670 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, do you want to
catch up and CE5?"

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's now hundreds of
thousands of people forming

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.438 align:middle line:90%
groups all over the world.

00:56:20.438 --> 00:56:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of like
meetup in a way,

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.140 align:middle line:90%
like a meetup sort of group.

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a whole
library of phenomena,

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:28.345 align:middle line:90%
things to look for.

00:56:28.345 --> 00:56:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure that if
you see something in the sky.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a satellite.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So this will help you
identify your phenomena.

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That's really
important because again,

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.120 align:middle line:84%
when we were out a lot of
people were like, oh my God,

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:40.930 align:middle line:90%
there's something.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:43.237 align:middle line:84%
But straight away,
Greer debunked it.

00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:45.070 align:middle line:84%
He's like, no, that's
definitely a satellite

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:46.528 align:middle line:84%
because he'd pull
up an app and you

00:56:46.528 --> 00:56:48.730 align:middle line:84%
could tell that was the
trajectory of something.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So you want to look
for objects that

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.740 align:middle line:90%
are moving in an unusual way.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the app will
give you a good sense

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:03.055 align:middle line:84%
of how to identify that
and also with practice.

00:57:03.055 --> 00:57:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It's always good to pull
up the satellite charts,

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and you get a sense of what's
real and what isn't over time.

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.905 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really interesting.

00:57:08.905 --> 00:57:12.550 align:middle line:84%
People always talk about being
able to identify what you see.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But the things that I've
seen with him and on my own,

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.660 align:middle line:84%
you don't need no one
to identify those.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:90%
That was like--

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.717 align:middle line:90%
>> --that was a UFO!

00:57:22.717 --> 00:57:24.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason that it's
important for people

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:28.330 align:middle line:10%
to understand the nature of
consciousness and meditation is

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:33.400 align:middle line:10%
because all the technologies
that ET civilizations are using

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:39.300 align:middle line:10%
interface with coherent
thought and consciousness.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Using something
like our cell phones

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.480 align:middle line:84%
or these cameras
or the internet,

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.880 align:middle line:90%
it's a speed of light.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you're from a galaxy 2.5
million light years from here

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.500 align:middle line:84%
like Andromeda at
the speed of light,

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:54.160 align:middle line:84%
you take a 2.5 million
years to get a signal there

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.390 align:middle line:90%
and another 2 and 1/2--

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> To get it back.

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --to get it back.

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.320 align:middle line:90%
It's 5 million years.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:01.870 align:middle line:10%
So we're dealing with an
understanding of reality.

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:07.510 align:middle line:84%
The root of it is understanding
this consciousness field.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.385 align:middle line:84%
And that's what everyone
has to understand and then

00:58:10.385 --> 00:58:11.185 align:middle line:90%
begin to practice.

00:58:11.185 --> 00:58:13.967 align:middle line:84%
It's why that meditation
approach is so important.

00:58:13.967 --> 00:58:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's really
three phases to it,

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:17.097 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
what's in the app.

00:58:17.097 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what I'd love
you to walk me through now

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:23.098 align:middle line:84%
because most
people, like myself,

00:58:23.098 --> 00:58:25.640 align:middle line:84%
would have watched the movie
and been like, all right, great.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do
some meditation.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:27.787 align:middle line:90%
I know how to do that.

00:58:27.787 --> 00:58:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll quickly put on
a meditation app.

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done
meditation for 20 years,

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.160 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to give it a go.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't work.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.540 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So, what
advice can you give

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:42.050 align:middle line:84%
to people that haven't
meditated before

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:44.240 align:middle line:84%
to learn some skills
and techniques to be

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.220 align:middle line:90%
able to help them focus?

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's why there's
a whole meditation training

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.920 align:middle line:90%
course in the app.

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And because ultimately
first of all,

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:57.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
what meditation is.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:00.800 align:middle line:10%
Most people the word
meditation just means to think.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
it's specifically

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.980 align:middle line:84%
talking about using
techniques so you experience

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that deep quiet
aspect of your mind

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that's not limited by space and
time, this deep samadhi state.

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.440 align:middle line:10%
The reason that's important
is that if you understand

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.020 align:middle line:10%
the nature of
consciousness, then

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.320 align:middle line:10%
you end up having the
ability to say, OK, now

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:25.432 align:middle line:10%
I know where I'm going.

00:59:25.432 --> 00:59:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Because most people sit down
and do a meditation technique,

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:29.640 align:middle line:84%
they don't know what
the purpose of it is.

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Any meditation
technique really should

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.670 align:middle line:84%
be geared towards
the technique ending

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and you sitting in a
state of complete silence

00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:40.245 align:middle line:84%
where the mind is
clear, empty, unbounded.

00:59:40.245 --> 00:59:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And now ready to--

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And then ready to see.

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's phase one.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who
meditate frequently

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:48.650 align:middle line:90%
can take just a few minutes.

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Other people may need
to meditate for an hour.

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But you get into
that quiet state.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in that deep quiet
state, then you can intend.

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is a little subtle.

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.130 align:middle line:84%
You're still in a quiet
relaxed state of mind,

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:05.240 align:middle line:84%
but you intend to
see remote places.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.490 align:middle line:10%
And you're asking
in consciousness,

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.050 align:middle line:10%
where are the ET craft?

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Where are their planets?

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Where are the ET beings,
if they're in the area?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you mean see
or do you mean "see"?

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I mean see
with consciousness.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.263 align:middle line:84%
The CIA will call
it remote viewing.

01:00:21.263 --> 01:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But ancient people
would just call

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
it being the way of the
seer, your third eye.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And so those abilities--

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:29.980 align:middle line:90%
those grow slowly.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are things we
can do to practice that.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But once you practice the
meditation in a deep--

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
once you're in a
quiet state, then you

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
intend to see, ask,
where are the craft?

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Where are the ET beings?

01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And then become silent and see
what pops into your awareness.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, is that what's been
happening to me when I hear

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.737 align:middle line:84%
turn around, maybe
here, 45 degrees?

01:00:54.737 --> 01:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And everyone gets
this differently.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Some people will be visual.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Some will get words.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Some will just have a--

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, some will just
be a knowingness.

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is different in how
they get intuitive knowledge.

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But then once that happens, then
the third phase is let's say,

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing way out in
our solar system by Saturn.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And you see this ET
spacecraft and the occupants.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, then you want to guide
them from Saturn to the Earth.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And let's say, if you're out
in the desert of Arizona,

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.450 align:middle line:90%
you zoom in mentally.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:33.420 align:middle line:84%
You show them visually
here's where we are.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Boom--

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I describe it to the group
that I was doing a guided

01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
meditation for, I described
it as Google Earth.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, same thing.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the visual,
though, seeing that oooh--

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's America, now there's
California, now there's--

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You start out
doing it that way.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But what evolves eventually
is that you actually

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
are out there, like Ingo
Swann, he would actually

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
go out to Saturn.

01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.820 align:middle line:90%
The CIA--

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you do that
I guess enough times--

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --your brain becomes, your
consciousness becomes more

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.058 align:middle line:90%
and more used to the idea of it.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you have these
experiences I call overrides

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
where you'll be in that state,
suddenly you'll see clear

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
as a bell an ET face or a craft
or a console or their planet.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you're
staying in that deep state

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and connecting to them.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately,
inviting them respectfully.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had so much personal
success with this "Google

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Earth" technique, but now I'm so
excited to actually get to see

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:36.725 align:middle line:84%
how Doctor Greer
himself does it.

01:02:36.725 --> 01:02:40.010 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:45.000 align:middle line:10%
>> And now let us expand further
into the space around the Earth

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.350 align:middle line:10%
and the Merkabah expands.

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth itself
is within the Merkabah

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and within the field
of our consciousness.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.770 align:middle line:90%


01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we expand
this vision, we see

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that the entire solar system
is pure consciousness vibrating

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
at a frequency to create
planets and space.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.520 align:middle line:90%


01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that every
planet is awake and conscious

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and that our solar
system is filled

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
centers and vehicles

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
awaiting the arrival of
humanity into a time of peace.

01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%


01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Let us stay in this state
of expanded consciousness

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and allow ourselves to see
the extraterrestrial vehicles

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.308 align:middle line:84%
and peoples that have
been assigned to Earth.

01:03:56.308 --> 01:03:59.050 align:middle line:90%


01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And as we see them, we invite
them here or wherever you

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:08.930 align:middle line:90%
are to be in contact with us.

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And we tell them that
we are ambassadors

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
of peace to the universe and
to all civilizations capable

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
of interstellar travel and
show them our exact location.

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you are
on Earth right now,

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
connect to the spacecraft
and to the people,

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:44.220 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials within it.

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And know that, with a clear
laser light coherent thought,

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
they will see your
exact location.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you showed them the
Earth, whatever continent you

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
are in and your
country and your region

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and the place where you
are currently sitting.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And you just effortlessly
zoom in to that location over

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and over again until you feel
they have seen your location.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And invite them to
appear in any way that

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.452 align:middle line:84%
is safe and appropriate
for this time and place

01:05:28.452 --> 01:05:31.860 align:middle line:90%
and for this group.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And however they
choose to appear,

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
we express our gratitude and
confirm that we are awake

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.075 align:middle line:84%
enough and educated enough
to see them and know

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:45.875 align:middle line:90%
their presence.

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:49.170 align:middle line:90%


01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the biggest surprises
for me and one of the greatest

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
things that I've taken away
from doing CE5 in a group is how

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
amazing it is to be able
to share these profound

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.350 align:middle line:90%
experiences with other people.

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Being with a group of people
where all of your intentions

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:07.620 align:middle line:84%
are aligned and
feeling that unity

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and that love in the group is
honestly quite overwhelming.

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking about
civilizations that are highly

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.520 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.240 align:middle line:90%
They are not using fossil fuels.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They have super
advanced energy systems

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that they have learned to
manage on their own planet.

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, what have they done?

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:34.890 align:middle line:84%
They've learned to
coexist with each other,

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
otherwise they'd be
gone, wouldn't they?

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's one way
of looking at it.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of
these civilizations

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.130 align:middle line:90%
are completely telepathic.

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:47.570 align:middle line:90%
They communicate with thought.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.310 align:middle line:90%
We experience that a lot.

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:50.810 align:middle line:90%
They respond to our thoughts.

01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
We know that that's how
they're interacting with us.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So, what are they
doing with each other?

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely nothing
to hide in their society.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
There is no room for
hatred, for fear,

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
for division, for
any of those things

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that we experience as
humans because we talk.

01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
existing in a thought

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
spectrum as your communication,
then you know what I mean?

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You're at a state of peace,
aren't you, with each other?

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.660 align:middle line:90%
You've worked it out.

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that guy over
there, he keeps

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
on having these bad
thoughts about me.

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I can read them and so can this
person, and so can this person.

01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:31.210 align:middle line:90%


01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's all of these other
ways of actually really sifting

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.480 align:middle line:84%
through the rubbish
and the nonsense

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and getting to a
place in yourself

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
where you've had enough
experiences to know

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
the truth of our
existence in the universe.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:53.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I came here to do what
I can to help our planet,

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.980 align:middle line:10%
the nature we are of and
from, and our species.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Feeling the coalescence
of the group coming together

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.040 align:middle line:10%
and the love that's felt
for all of creation,

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.960 align:middle line:10%
not just others on our planet
and ETs, but all of creation,

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.620 align:middle line:10%
it's a very beautiful
thing to go through.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I sit in meditation to the
ETs asking if we could have

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
a more subtle event, give
me some sort of visual

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
in their own way that speaks
my language, so to speak,

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that I can use as a irrefutable
data that there is something

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:36.290 align:middle line:84%
happening between my direct
effort and their reciprocation

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:37.090 align:middle line:90%
of those efforts.

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was a physical
manifestation.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Other people saw it.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But to me, there was
something intensely personal

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.770 align:middle line:90%
that really impacted me.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Greer and the group
have been wonderful so far.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:52.340 align:middle line:10%
And they really emphasized not
to bring fear into the circle.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.729 align:middle line:10%
And they really helped
me to overcome it.

01:08:55.729 --> 01:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we saw the orb,
it was just wonderful.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
I felt really good.

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:08.180 align:middle line:10%
>> What I take from CE5 with
me everywhere else is love

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.830 align:middle line:10%
and interaction.

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:13.819 align:middle line:10%
And when I'm with others,
I think about things.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:17.210 align:middle line:10%
And I wish that I could
take everyone and everyone

01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:20.630 align:middle line:10%
could experience CE5
because it'll open your mind

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:21.470 align:middle line:10%
and open your heart.

01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:25.939 align:middle line:10%
And it'll show you that
there's more than just

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:29.000 align:middle line:10%
transactional connections
where everything doesn't need

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.500 align:middle line:10%
to be monetized,
everything doesn't

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.380 align:middle line:10%
need to be capitalistic
or based on that

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.210 align:middle line:10%
because we're not
getting anything.

01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:42.229 align:middle line:10%
CE5, you aren't going to
get riches from contact.

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:45.609 align:middle line:84%
But you're going
to get fulfillment.

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:48.189 align:middle line:84%
>> People really have to
understand that there is this

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
mass effect when a
fairly small number--

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and the magic number
is 1% apparently.

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
borne out in quantum.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So 7 billion is how much,
7 million or 70 million?

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> 70.

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> 70.

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.870 align:middle line:90%
So we--

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So 70 to 80 million
totally doable.

01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> --that app and then
we should be fine.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.160 align:middle line:10%
>> So that's--

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.900 align:middle line:10%
>> So, is that a goal for you to
get into a set of circumstances

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.860 align:middle line:10%
where we could have 70 million
people just like we have Earth

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.500 align:middle line:10%
Hour, have 70 million
people all at once--

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Doing CE5.

01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:22.270 align:middle line:10%
>> --doing CE5?

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:24.320 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's building.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think, it's something
completely attainable.

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I agree.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's 1 in 100 people.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And it may be less because
if enough people are

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.670 align:middle line:84%
in a deep and powerful
state of consciousness, then

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a better chance
that it can be half that.

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that's doable.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.060 align:middle line:90%
And the studies have been done--

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You have cool
goals, Dr. Greer.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.430 align:middle line:90%

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:51.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a really cool goal.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's how transformation
happens on a planet.

01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It happens first
in consciousness.

01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, is the goal, I guess,
to move people from a 3D state

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
which most people are bumbling
around into a 4 to even 5D

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:07.890 align:middle line:90%
state by doing--

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the
primacy I always say,

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
the prime changing effect is
always the consciousness behind

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.435 align:middle line:90%
anything.

the more that these
