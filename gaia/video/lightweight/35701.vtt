Elizabeth, Carl's here!

3
00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:06.982
You ready?

4
00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:08.054
<v Elizabeth>Yeah, I'm ready.</v>

5
00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:09.194
(footsteps)

6
00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:10.374
Are you?

7
00:00:10.374 --> 00:00:13.594
<v Rich>Of course, let's go.</v>

8
00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:17.374
(footsteps)

9
00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:22.476
(gentle madolin music)

10
00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.818
<v Elizabeth>I have to tell you something.</v>

11
00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:35.448
<v Rich>OK?</v>

12
00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:40.488
<v Elizabeth>I have a family nickname.</v>

13
00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:42.508
<v Rich>Oh, come on.</v>

14
00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:43.738
How bad could it be?

15
00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:45.018
<v Elizabeth>Bad.</v>

16
00:00:45.018 --> 00:00:46.718
<v Rich>"Beth".</v>
<v Elizabeth>No.</v>

17
00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:48.888
<v Rich>Betsy.</v>
<v Elizabeth>No.</v>

18
00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:52.028

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:57.878
(electric guitar riff)

20
00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:09.419
<v Rich>Lizzy? Dizzy Lizzy!</v>

21
00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:11.869
<v Elizabeth>No.</v>

22
00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.609
Bitsy.

23
00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:18.339
<v Rich>Bitsy?</v>

24
00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:19.379
That's cute!

25
00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.549
<v Elizabeth>Exactly.</v>

26
00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.939
<v Rich>Bitsy. I think it's kind of hot.</v>

27
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.779
<v Elizabeth>Rich, please be nice.</v>

28
00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:29.919
This is hard enough.

29
00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:32.579
(laughter)

30
00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.839
<v ->So, can I call you "Bitsy"?</v>

31
00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.389
<v ->Rich, please.</v>

32
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.419
Are you ready?

33
00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.249
<v ->Absolutely, lead the way.</v>

34
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.159
<v ->Oh, and nothing about the job, okay?</v>

35
00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.809
Where's your suitcase?

36
00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.529
Rich?

37
00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.509
<v ->I'm coming, I'm coming.</v>

38
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.219
<v ->Oh, Bitsy, baby!</v>

39
00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.359
Oh, Uncle Stan's going to be so happy to

40
00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.659
know that you made it.

41
00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:52.759
<v ->Mom, this is Rich.</v>

42
00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.939
<v ->Oh, Rich!</v>

43
00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:54.999
Oh.

44
00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.309
Or is it Richard?

45
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.039
<v ->It doesn't matter.</v>

46
00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.119
<v ->Oh, Bitsy, he's so handsome.</v>

47
00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:00.739
<v ->Mom, I go by Elizabeth now.</v>

48
00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.159

49
00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.680
(cackling laughter)

50
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.260
Look at you!

51
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.160
Hey! Welcome to the family.

52
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.920
I'm Stan Junior, Bitsy's cousin.

53
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.061
Come on, let's get you a beer.

54
00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:12.841
<v ->OK!</v>

55
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:14.541
<v ->Hey everybody, this is Bitsy's boyfriend!</v>

56
00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:18.451
<v ->Oh, hey man, you really snagged a good one!</v>

57
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.952
<v ->Hey, did you know I used to go</v>

58
00:03:19.952 --> 00:03:21.772
steady with her in junior high.

59
00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:22.793
No hard feelings!

60
00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:25.163
(laughing)

61
00:03:25.193 --> 00:03:26.493
<v ->Everybody listen up!</v>

62
00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:28.153
This is Bitsy's boyfriend.

63
00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:31.033
<v Multiple>Oh, hi! Hello!</v>

64
00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:32.453

67
00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:37.413
<v ->There's a lot of broken hearts in this room.</v>

68
00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:39.213
<v ->OK.</v>

<v ->This is so great.</v>

71
00:03:53.553 --> 00:03:54.653
When's the funeral?

72
00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:56.613
<v ->Stan didn't want one.</v>

73
00:03:56.613 --> 00:03:58.133
<v ->I got a buddy down there at Heinz Field.</v>

74
00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:00.633
We're gonna bury his ashes in the end-zone.

75
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:02.353
<v ->Stan will love that.</v>

76
00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:04.443
<v ->Mmm hmm.</v>

77
00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:15.993
<v ->Oh! Look at you!</v>

78
00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:17.953
Itsy Bitsy!

79
00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:20.413
<v ->Oh, you are still so thin!</v>

80
00:04:20.413 --> 00:04:22.933
<v ->You do look real good though.</v>

81
00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:24.973
<v ->Oh, you look real good!</v>

82
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:28.946

00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:32.036
<v ->Great to see you.</v>

84
00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.586
<v ->I'm in, I'll be there.</v>

85
00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:34.526
Monday.

86
00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:36.556
OK.

87
00:04:37.386 --> 00:04:39.646
Great news, I'm going to London.

88
00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.146
<v ->Again?</v>

89
00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:42.166
When?

90
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:44.186
<v ->First meeting's on Monday.</v>

91
00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:45.806
<v ->First meeting?</v>

92
00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:47.726
<v ->I just closed the deal now, I can't believe it.</v>

93
00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:50.006
Two big projects with Denny.

94
00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:52.466
Good money, they'll give me a place to stay.

95
00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:54.386
<v ->How long?</v>

96
00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:57.126
<v ->It's a two year commitment.</v>

97
00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.546
<v ->Well, you know, I can't leave right now,</v>

98
00:04:58.546 --> 00:04:59.866
I told Mom I'd stay and help--

99
00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.586
<v ->Elizabeth, they can't pay for you.</v>

100
00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:04.686
I have to go by myself.

101
00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:07.506
<v ->Wha?</v>

102
00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:10.086
I can't afford our rent by myself?

103
00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.326
<v ->I can sublet.</v>

104
00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:13.106
We're paid through the end of the month.

105
00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:15.046
We'll figure something out.

106
00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:18.146
If I leave right now, I can catch a flight back

107
00:05:18.146 --> 00:05:19.406
to New York.

108
00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:21.226
They have me booked to Heathrow tomorrow.

109
00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:24.536
<v ->You already have flights?</v>

110
00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:26.726
<v ->Hey, hey, hey, hey.</v>

111
00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.936
You OK?

112
00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:33.546
<v ->Your suitcase.</v>

113
00:05:33.546 --> 00:05:36.016
<v ->It's in the car.</v>

114
00:05:39.726 --> 00:05:42.926
E, I'm sorry.

115
00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.966
I'll call you from New York, OK?

116
00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.156
I promise.

117
00:05:49.446 --> 00:05:54.446

♫ How could I slip and

124
00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:39.586
♫ Make the same mistake twice?

125
00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:47.716
♫ When did I learn to

126
00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:54.606
♫ Forgo my own advice? ♫

127
00:06:59.446 --> 00:07:01.726

128
00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:03.546
in the ionosphere.

129
00:07:03.546 --> 00:07:07.446
<v ->Earth to Bitsy, come in Bitsy, Bitsy.</v>

130
00:07:07.446 --> 00:07:08.506
Over.

Where's your underwear model at?

134
00:07:30.986 --> 00:07:33.556
<v ->He left.</v>

135
00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.686
He's moving to London.

136
00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:38.046
<v ->Ah, Bitsy, that's too bad.</v>

137
00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:40.946
He was so handsome.

138
00:07:40.946 --> 00:07:43.826
<v ->And I lost my job.</v>

139
00:07:43.826 --> 00:07:45.266
Two weeks ago.

140
00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:49.166
<v ->Oh, honey, don't worry.</v>

141
00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:50.806
You can stay in your old room.

142
00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:54.386
<v ->No, Mom, no, I can't stay here.</v>

143
00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:56.606
All the design jobs are in New York.

144
00:07:56.606 --> 00:07:58.486
<v ->I'll move the sewing machine.</v>

145
00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:00.106
Now eat something.

146
00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:01.246

You know, the burg's good.

155
00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:30.626
Back for like two years.

156
00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:33.146
Ooh, I got a couple of paintings

157
00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.586
in a show next month.

158
00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:36.626
How's New York?

159
00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:38.206
You still doing art?

160
00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:39.646
<v ->Not so much.</v>

161
00:08:39.646 --> 00:08:41.346
I work in design now.

162
00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.346
<v ->Awesome.</v>

163
00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:45.966
My studio partner works for a designer downtown.

164

<v ->Order up.</v>

165
00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:50.496

166

It's really good to see you.

167

00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:30.665
Check this out.

182
00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:33.195
I didn't know midgets were that limber.

183
00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:37.535
<v ->I think they prefer to be called "little people."</v>

184
00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:40.795
<v ->So, Chelsea Web Design, huh?</v>

185
00:10:40.795 --> 00:10:42.855
<v ->Yes, I was with them for three years.</v>

186
00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:44.735
<v ->I lived in New York in the '80s.</v>

187
00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.255
Still have a place there.

188
00:10:46.255 --> 00:10:48.215
That's what we offer the local market,

189
00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.895
that New York edge.

190
00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:53.675
See, we don't do design, we do undesign,

191
00:10:53.675 --> 00:10:56.055
we do anti-design, we're beyond design,

192
00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:58.435
design is done, over.

193
00:10:58.435 --> 00:11:01.735
All that's left is image and image becomes brand,

194
00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:03.575
and brands design themselves.

195
00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:04.935
It's brandification.

196
00:11:04.935 --> 00:11:07.255
They don't need us, we just channel the brand,

197
00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.955
we brandify, we're conductors.

198
00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:12.895
Think of it as applying brand names.

199
00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:15.315
We enhance brandosity.

200
00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:17.135
We're brandoids.

201
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:21.845
Brandoid, brandoid, brandoid.

202
00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:28.315
<v ->Oh, sorry, I actually, I fixed the problem</v>

203
00:11:28.315 --> 00:11:29.075
with those--

204
00:11:29.075 --> 00:11:32.455
<v ->Sweetie, there are no problems.</v>

205
00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:34.115
Just think about what you're putting out there

206
00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:36.055
when you say that.

207
00:11:36.055 --> 00:11:37.855
We use the term "issues."

208
00:11:37.855 --> 00:11:40.275
<v ->Oh, OK.</v>

209
00:11:40.275 --> 00:11:44.215
Well, I fixed the issues with those

210
00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:45.755
pop-up windows.

211
00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:47.575
<v ->Oh, pop-ups, yes.</v>

212
00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:49.475
Back in the day.

213
00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.835
With all the intrusions we face now,

214
00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:54.905
I'm just so over them.

215
00:11:55.955 --> 00:11:57.695
OK.

216
00:11:57.695 --> 00:11:59.955
What else have you got, hon?

217
00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:02.395
You know, I used to create one way,

218
00:12:02.395 --> 00:12:05.115
but now I've discovered a brand new way.

219
00:12:05.115 --> 00:12:07.755
You've got to think out of the womb.

220
00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:09.655
It'll change the way you work,

221
00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:11.075
it'll change the way you live,

222
00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:14.805
it'll change just about everything.

223
00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:16.235
Hmm.

224
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.255
<v ->We're the best agency in town.</v>

225
00:12:18.255 --> 00:12:20.595
What makes you good enough to work here?

226
00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:21.375
<v ->Well, I--</v>

227
00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:23.555
<v ->We clean up at the awards every year.</v>

228
00:12:23.555 --> 00:12:25.035
I don't see any on your resume.

229
00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:26.195
<v ->There's actually--</v>

230
00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:27.335
<v ->You're a lightweight.</v>

231
00:12:27.335 --> 00:12:30.525
You've done no-- (phone rings)

232
00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:32.815
Yeah.

233
00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:34.775
<v ->I'm sorry if I wasted your time.</v>

234
00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:36.655
<v ->I thought that, guy's an idiot.</v>

235
00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:37.835
I told you I didn't want to talk to him.

236
00:12:37.835 --> 00:12:40.315
Why did you even bring this to me?

237
00:12:40.315 --> 00:12:42.575
No.

238
00:12:42.575 --> 00:12:45.585
No.

239
00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:49.505
How many times do we have to go over this?

240
00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:59.125
<v ->You OK?</v>

241
00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:02.835
Benny, I'm out.

242
00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:07.835
♫ Man with the eyes of gloom ♫

243
00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:16.585
<v ->Anything else, hon?</v>

244
00:13:17.955 --> 00:13:19.735
<v ->Wow.</v>

245
00:13:19.735 --> 00:13:22.545
I forgot.

246
00:13:24.215 --> 00:13:25.495
I thought you were a vegan.

247
00:13:25.495 --> 00:13:28.505
<v ->No, that's coffee shop hype.</v>

248
00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:33.095
So.

249
00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:36.075
What's going on?

250
00:13:36.075 --> 00:13:40.775
<v ->Since I've been back, I've been like,</v>

251
00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:42.615
floating.

252
00:13:42.615 --> 00:13:44.115
<v ->I know exactly what you mean.</v>

253
00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:44.995
Me, too.

254
00:13:44.995 --> 00:13:47.395
Like job to job, school to school.

255
00:13:47.395 --> 00:13:49.155
Women to men.

256
00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:51.395
Back to women.

257
00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:53.855
(laughs)

258
00:13:53.855 --> 00:13:56.295
<v ->Wait, no, seriously.</v>

259
00:13:56.295 --> 00:14:01.295
<v ->Hey, you get used to it.</v>

260
00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:08.475
<v ->I just felt so invisible, and then,</v>

261
00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:10.375
I was totally floating.

262
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:14.105
Seriously, I felt my head hit the ceiling.

263
00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:17.115
<v ->Hey, you put another crack in that glass, right?</v>

264
00:14:17.115 --> 00:14:19.555
<v ->I just felt so stupid.</v>

265
00:14:19.555 --> 00:14:21.455
Empty.

266
00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:23.795
Like my whole life is just empty.

267
00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:26.135
<v ->Awesome, that's awesome.</v>

268
00:14:26.135 --> 00:14:27.515
That's the whole point.

269
00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:31.195
You gotta embrace emptiness.

270
00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:35.095
Let emptiness be your guide.

271
00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:37.905
Speaking of emptiness.

272
00:14:39.495 --> 00:14:40.975
Anyway.

273
00:14:40.975 --> 00:14:43.465
Why fight it?

274
00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:48.155
<v ->Here you go, hon.</v>

275
00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:49.875
<v ->Marlene.</v>

276
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:52.285
To emptiness.

277
00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:56.855
<v ->I'm living out of a suitcase,</v>

278
00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:01.395
my career is a disaster, I'm just,

279
00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:03.655
I'm just drifting.

280
00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:06.245
(phone dings)

281
00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:12.655
(sighs)

282
00:15:12.655 --> 00:15:17.235
<v ->Hey, it's OK to drift sometimes.</v>

283
00:15:17.235 --> 00:15:21.505
Come on, I'll float you home.

284
00:15:21.895 --> 00:15:25.465
♫ Words to say ♫

285
00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:30.235

286
00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:32.685

(phone dings)

288
00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:49.355
<v ->Elizabeth. When George told me about you,</v>

289
00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:51.475
he said you were my kind of designer.

290
00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:55.085
I think he meant it as an insult, actually.

291
00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:59.635
Did he give you the "I hate design" speech?

292
00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:02.515
<v ->Yeah, he talked a little bit about that.</v>

293
00:16:02.515 --> 00:16:05.475
<v ->George is such a jackass.</v>

294
00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:07.975
But he gets points for this.

295
00:16:07.975 --> 00:16:09.495
You're a terrific designer.

296
00:16:09.495 --> 00:16:12.455
We could really use someone like you here.

297
00:16:12.455 --> 00:16:15.295
<v ->Oh.</v>

298
00:16:15.295 --> 00:16:17.635
Wow.

299
00:16:17.635 --> 00:16:21.975
<v ->So, Elizabeth, what are you looking for?</v>

300
00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:26.915
<v ->Well...</v>

304
00:16:34.155 --> 00:16:36.945

Hey.

311
00:17:30.156 --> 00:17:32.586
You'll get used to it.
