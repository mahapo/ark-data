<v Voiceover>The miracle doesn't end there.</v>

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:18.531 line:15% 
What happened to the scar tissue?

4
00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:20.263 line:15% 
That's the miracle.

5
00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:26.391
<v Voiceover>There were too many individual circumstances</v>

6
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.086

<v Voiceover>Some people might say,</v>

8
00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:36.129
"No, it's not a miracle.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.508 line:15% 
"It's just a coincidence."

10
00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:43.354 line:15% 
But I am convinced that it is an answer to prayer.

11
00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Voiceover>And I'm thinking, "How can this be?</v>

12
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.483
"This is a joke.

13
00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.632
"This does not happen."

14
00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.867
<v Voiceover>Regardless of our personal beliefs</v>

15
00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:56.523
about religion or the supernatural,

16
00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.061
we all recognize when certain things happen,

17
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.165
that break the rules of everyday life.

18
00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:04.447 line:15% 
When something out of the ordinary happens,

19
00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:07.818 line:15% 
whether you call it a miracle or a coincidence,

20
00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:11.993
it can stop you in your tracks and make you take notice.

21
00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:17.343
(music)

22
00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:20.318
Let's continue examining these phenomenal happenings,

23
00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:24.867
which we began to do in Stories of Miracles part one.

24
00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:29.619
The year was 1950.

25
00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.442
Herb Kipf and 13 other singers

26
00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:33.694
in the Westside Baptist Church choir

27
00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.496
usually arrived a little early

28
00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:39.133
every Wednesday evening for their 7:30 practice,

29
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.013
but on one memorable night, Herb was running late.

30
00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:45.649
(clock chimes)

31
00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.466 line:15% 
<v ->I was at home at that time, writing a letter to our</v>

32
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:52.462 line:15% 
denominational headquarters in Chicago.

33
00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:54.744
I wanted to get that letter off and drop it in

34
00:01:54.744 --> 00:01:58.200
on the way to choir practice, but I was running out of time.

35
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.427
Finally, I got it done.

36
00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:02.019
So we hurried over as rapidly as we could,

37
00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:06.061
and got there and the Westside was dark.

38
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.727
Completely dark, no lights anyplace.

39
00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:11.266
And I wondered what had happened.

40
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:15.516
I had to park about a block away from the building, and...

41
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:19.170
realized that when I got there,

42
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.517
the steeple was lying about where my car was usually parked.

43
00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:27.039
(dramatic music)

44
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.071
Three minutes before the time

45
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:30.311
for the choir to begin to practice.

46
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:33.468
Suddenly there was a terrific explosion.

47
00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:36.689
It simply blew apart the entire church.

48
00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.652
A gas leak explosion.

49
00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:40.273
The sidewalls were blown out.

50
00:02:40.273 --> 00:02:44.251
The roof and the floor system wound up in the basement,

51
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:48.251
and surely, nobody could live through something like that.

52
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.454
<v Voiceover>The fire chief immediately</v>

53
00:02:49.454 --> 00:02:51.715
enlisted Herb's help to provide a head count

54
00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:54.030
of any survivors so they could determine

55
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.717
who had been trapped in the rubble.

56
00:02:56.717 --> 00:03:00.174
<v ->I rounded them up, and nobody was missing.</v>

57
00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:02.989
Everybody was there that we were looking for.

58
00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.488
Each one of those people was detained just enough

59
00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.674
to miss that explosion.

60
00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:11.170
Two little girls, senior high kids, usually

61
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.029
were very prompt, but this particular night,

62
00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.076
one of the girls said she wanted to wait

63
00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:18.348
until a program was over.

64
00:03:18.348 --> 00:03:19.938
She wanted to see the finale of a program

65
00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:23.500
that she was interested in, and before the finale came,

66
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.241
the explosion went up.

67
00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:29.078
Another one was my cousin, Harvey.

68
00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:31.180
His wife was out of the town that evening.

69
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.547
She'd taken the little girl along,

70
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.425
but he had two boys and the neighbors

71
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:38.059
had invited them over for dinner,

72
00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:42.048
and as they sat around, the conversation was good,

73
00:03:42.048 --> 00:03:45.045
the meal was good, and they talked too long.

74
00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:47.819
So, they were late.

75
00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.178
There were others who had a story very similar.

76
00:03:52.328 --> 00:03:56.637
While we held hands in a circle, we formed a circle,

77
00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:59.176
and gave thanks for the deliverance that we had had.

78
00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:03.858
Because we realized that a miracle had taken place.

79
00:04:05.288 --> 00:04:09.319
The time was set so accurately because the steeple,

80
00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.458
when it fell, also cut the power lines exactly

81
00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:17.351
three minutes before the beginning of the choir practice.

82
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:19.996
We know that because the clock stopped

83
00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:24.996
at the radio station exactly at 27 minutes after 7 o'clock.

84
00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:30.118
And there are some people who scoff at miracles

85
00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:32.240
because they don't believe it.

86
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.238
"Can't be, it just happened."

87
00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:40.238
But there were too many individual circumstances involved

88
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:44.906
in that church explosion for it to be just a happenstance.

89
00:04:47.364 --> 00:04:52.308
(soft piano music)

90
00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.926
<v Voiceover>Coincidences usually happen unexpectedly,</v>

91
00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:01.548
but some people attribute them

92
00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:04.471
to their own conscious desire or prayer.

93
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.052
In the following story, a mother traces back

94
00:05:07.052 --> 00:05:11.942
an amazing coincidence to a special request she had made.

95
00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.155
(music)

96
00:05:18.155 --> 00:05:22.347
<v ->My daughter and her husband, who have two little boys,</v>

97
00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:27.347 line:15% 
had told me that they were vaguely thinking of moving

98
00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:32.349
because their house was a little too crowded

99
00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.624
if ever they were to have a third child.

100
00:05:35.624 --> 00:05:40.104
So I had just remembered that, and I thought,

101
00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:42.845
"Oh, well, why don't I go and

102
00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:45.746
"have a look in the neighborhood?"

103
00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:48.706
<v Voiceover>She had driven around</v>

104
00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:50.722
her neighborhood for about an hour when a

105
00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:53.868
white house with black shutters caught her eye.

106
00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:56.225
She remembered seeing it several years earlier

107
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.721
when it had been up for sale, and knew that it would

108
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:00.769
be perfect for her daughter.

109
00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:04.844
<v ->So I parked in front of it, and I prayed</v>

110
00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:08.233
to the Lord and I thought,

111
00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:13.233
"Lord, I know that what I'm asking is a little silly

112
00:06:13.278 --> 00:06:16.499
"because this house is not for sale.

113
00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.219
"Obviously, people are very happy in that house.

114
00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.992
"But do you think that, perhaps,

115
00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:24.915
"you could put it on the market?"

116
00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:29.915
Two days later, my daughter called me and she said to me,

117
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:34.641
"Mom, we have made an offer on a house."

118
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.094
And I said, "Yes, already?

119
00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:39.334
"Did you find something really good?"

120
00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:41.873
And she said, "Yes, I think we did,

121
00:06:41.873 --> 00:06:44.454
"And it's not very far from you."

122
00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:48.570
So I said to her, "It's not far from me? Where is it?"

123
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.229
She said, "Well, it's on the cul-de-sac."

124
00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.309
And I said, "On the cul-de-sac?

125
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:59.238
"You mean, could it be a white house with black shutters?"

126
00:06:59.238 --> 00:07:01.414
And she said yes.

127
00:07:01.414 --> 00:07:05.520
So, I thought, "That must be the house."

128
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.611
It was the house, and I said,

129
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.610
"But, Christine, it's not for sale.

130
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.962
And she said, "It's going to be for sale in two days."

131
00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:20.430
My college roommate lives a few doors from it,

132
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.068
and she told me that the neighbor told her

133
00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:26.990
it was going to be for sale in two days.

134
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.342
So my children were able to buy the house

135
00:07:31.342 --> 00:07:35.868
and now I love to sit on the lawn in front of the house

136
00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:38.450
and look at my grandchildren play

137
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.761
with their new friends on that cul-de-sac.

138
00:07:44.988 --> 00:07:46.449
<v Voiceover>People say that love seems to be</v>

139
00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:48.156
a motivating factor behind the

140
00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:50.577
miracle stories they tell us about.

141
00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:53.830
Love from a friend, love from a parent to a child,

142
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.433
or compassion for a stranger.

143
00:07:56.433 --> 00:07:58.896
<v ->Some people might say, no, it's not a miracle.</v>

144
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:02.800
It's just a coincidence, but I am convinced

145
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.416
that it is an answer to prayer.

146
00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:09.866
I was not in a terrible need when I prayed.

147
00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:14.866
I wasn't just begging God to meet a need of my children.

148
00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:19.460
It's a prayer that came spontaneously to me

149
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.724
when I was in front of the house.

150
00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:26.096
And that makes me think of the letter

151
00:08:26.096 --> 00:08:29.541
of part of the Corinthian when he says

152
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:33.594
that we don't know always how to pray,

153
00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:37.136
and that the holy spirit prays for us.

154
00:08:37.136 --> 00:08:41.428
I think the holy spirit put that prayer in my mouth.

155
00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:48.035
(soft flute music)

156
00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:54.758 line:15% 
<v ->I remember a story of a woman who</v>

157
00:08:54.758 --> 00:08:57.942 line:15% 
was very nervous about walking down a bad street,

158
00:08:57.942 --> 00:09:02.304
and she saw a loiterer up ahead.

159
00:09:02.304 --> 00:09:05.664
And she thought, "This guy's bad news."

160
00:09:05.664 --> 00:09:07.936
So she'd been reading a book about angels

161
00:09:07.936 --> 00:09:10.699
and she said, "Oh angels, be with me now,"

162
00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:14.517
which is a very nice way to ask all that's really necessary.

163
00:09:14.517 --> 00:09:19.050
And she went on past this guy and he looked her up and down.

164
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.906
She could feel him sizing her up,

165
00:09:20.906 --> 00:09:24.245
but he didn't do anything to her and she got to the corner

166
00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:27.967
and broke into a run, and got to her home safely.

167
00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:30.590
But the next day she had heard there had been a mugging

168
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.673
around that corner about 10 minutes after she passed

169
00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.796
and it was another young woman.

170
00:09:35.796 --> 00:09:39.369
So she put on her red coat, which she always wore

171
00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:41.374
in the winter time and she went off to the police station

172
00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.350
and told the police officer what had happened

173
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.910
and he said, "We have that man in custody."

174
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.851
It is the same man.

175
00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:51.550
She looked at him in a lineup, and it was him.

176
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.368
And she told the officer that she was curious

177
00:09:55.368 --> 00:09:59.155
as to why he let her pass, and the officer said

178
00:09:59.155 --> 00:10:01.234
he was too and he would ask the criminal.

179
00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:03.208
And the criminal said, "Oh, yeah, I remember her.

180
00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:04.455
"The one in the red coat."

181
00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:06.372
But he said, "I wouldn't have bothered her

182
00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:08.644
"because she had those two big guys with her,

183
00:10:08.644 --> 00:10:10.532
"one on either side."

184
00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:14.084
So when you hear this story, you gasp and you think,

185
00:10:14.084 --> 00:10:15.672
"Oh, what a wonderful story.

186
00:10:15.672 --> 00:10:17.096
But I thought right away,

187
00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:19.556
what happened to the mugging victim?

188
00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:21.517
Where were her angels?

189
00:10:21.517 --> 00:10:24.313
Now I firmly believe they were right with her.

190
00:10:24.313 --> 00:10:26.830
If I have an angel, then you have an angel.

191
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.571
One of us is not singled out for attention

192
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:31.310
at the expense of the other.

193
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.819
The question always is, "Why did the angel stop to help

194
00:10:34.819 --> 00:10:36.471
"the woman in the red coat,

195
00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:39.191
"but didn't keep the victim from being mugged?"

196
00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:40.834
It's the age-old question.

197
00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:42.529
We really don't know.

198
00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:45.537
<v ->Why do some people get healed and not others?</v>

199
00:10:45.537 --> 00:10:49.664 line:15% 
Why do some prayers get answered and it seems others don't?

200
00:10:51.144 --> 00:10:55.724
And I don't have a quick answer except to say that

201
00:10:55.724 --> 00:10:59.883
God is not fundamentally in the miracle business.

202
00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:03.756
I will learn to receive what God has to offer,

203
00:11:03.756 --> 00:11:06.977
and not try and put God under my control.

204
00:11:06.977 --> 00:11:08.982
<v ->That's always a very difficult question to answer</v>

205
00:11:08.982 --> 00:11:13.281 line:15% 
and the only answer that I can give is that

206
00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:17.416
we really can't understand the workings of the universe,

207
00:11:17.416 --> 00:11:20.104
the workings of God, and it seems cruel,

208
00:11:20.104 --> 00:11:21.535
sometimes, to think that certain events

209
00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:23.594
might be part of the cosmic plan.

210
00:11:23.594 --> 00:11:27.017
<v ->Sometimes, it may be that God allows difficult things</v>

211
00:11:27.017 --> 00:11:30.591
in our lives in order to bring good out of them later.

212
00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:33.534
<v ->We are not alone in the world, and we,</v>

213
00:11:33.534 --> 00:11:37.560
I think we are part of a huge

214
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.565
tapestry of inter-relations,

215
00:11:41.565 --> 00:11:46.552
and what to us has been terrible hurt

216
00:11:46.552 --> 00:11:51.552
might be working for somebody else

217
00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:53.770
for the best.

218
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.972 line:15% 
<v ->Why does a miracle only have to be a correction,</v>

219
00:11:57.972 --> 00:11:59.477 line:15% 
say, of what we don't like?

220
00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:02.089
Nerves grow back, scars disappear,

221
00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:04.265
fractured skull is no longer there.

222
00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.550
Why does that have to be a miracle whereas if another child

223
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.204
still has his fractured skull, how do you know

224
00:12:09.204 --> 00:12:13.566
that isn't going to lead to a miracle, you see?

225
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.656
Because when you stop judging,

226
00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:17.288
you understand what one child said.

227
00:12:17.288 --> 00:12:21.395
He said, "If God took my little friend age six of cancer,

228
00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:23.389
"why did god make her in the first place?"

229
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:25.853
But then he went on to say, "But maybe her brother

230
00:12:25.853 --> 00:12:30.853
"will become a doctor, see, and maybe that's the miracle.

231
00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:33.488
"What if her brother discovers the cure

232
00:12:33.488 --> 00:12:35.750
"because of his sister?"

233
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.133
<v ->I have to learn not to say, "God, heal my broken arm,"</v>

234
00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:43.856
and get all disappointed and my nose out of joint

235
00:12:43.856 --> 00:12:46.746
if my arm doesn't get healed, but when I do see

236
00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:49.615
God heal someone to get very excited

237
00:12:49.615 --> 00:12:53.726
and rejoice for them and with them.

238
00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:56.164
<v Voiceover>In Joan Wester Anderson's book,</v>

239
00:12:56.164 --> 00:12:59.225
Where Miracles Happen, we hear the story of a man

240
00:12:59.225 --> 00:13:00.996
whose traveling music ministry

241
00:13:00.996 --> 00:13:03.684
brought him a thousand miles from home.

242
00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:06.436
He was at a crossroads in his life, not knowing

243
00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:10.478
if he was really helping anyone and was looking for a sign.

244
00:13:10.478 --> 00:13:13.586
(telephone rings)

245
00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:17.059 line:15% 
<v ->We were traveling as a musical family,</v>

246
00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:20.557 line:15% 
going through Ohio with two big motor coaches,

247
00:13:20.557 --> 00:13:24.386
with our family and some others and a music group

248
00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:28.514
going to churches and conventions and so on.

249
00:13:28.514 --> 00:13:32.258
And I was going through a real trying time in my life

250
00:13:32.258 --> 00:13:37.090
because I was thinking, "Where am I in my life?

251
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.596
"What's going on in my own life?

252
00:13:39.596 --> 00:13:41.482
"I'm telling other people they can have answers.

253
00:13:41.482 --> 00:13:44.948
"Do I really have the answers myself?

254
00:13:44.948 --> 00:13:47.687
"Has God really called me,

255
00:13:47.687 --> 00:13:50.737
"or should I maybe quit and get a job?"

256
00:13:50.737 --> 00:13:55.067
<v ->Even a person as spiritually well-developed</v>

257
00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:59.227
as Ken Gaub still reached a point in his life

258
00:13:59.227 --> 00:14:01.143
where he said, "God, I don't know if

259
00:14:01.143 --> 00:14:03.510
"what I'm doing is the right thing to do.

260
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.110
"Is this pleasing to you?

261
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.511
"I need to know, and I need to know soon.

262
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:08.492
"I'm burning out.

263
00:14:08.492 --> 00:14:10.444
"Give me a sign."

264
00:14:10.444 --> 00:14:14.358
<v ->These thoughts were going over and over in my mind.</v>

265
00:14:15.428 --> 00:14:18.421
So when everybody went to eat, I stayed in the coach

266
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:21.780
and sat there a while, and I got thirsty,

267
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.663
so I walked down the street to get a Pepsi,

268
00:14:25.663 --> 00:14:28.820
and I walked back, just slowly, casually,

269
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.820
and I heard a phone ringing, and I listened,

270
00:14:33.865 --> 00:14:36.009
"What is that?"

271
00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:39.123
There was a phone booth near a gas station.

272
00:14:39.123 --> 00:14:42.345
I remember it just rang, rang, rang and rang.

273
00:14:42.345 --> 00:14:44.126
And I thought, "That's odd.

274
00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:46.291
"I wonder why it's ringing like that.

275
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:48.584
"Maybe it's an emergency or something,

276
00:14:48.584 --> 00:14:50.164
"for somebody close by."

277
00:14:50.164 --> 00:14:52.947
So I went up and just went in the phone booth and

278
00:14:52.947 --> 00:14:55.250
picked up the phone and said, "Hello?"

279
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.506
Operator said, person to person call

280
00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:02.353
for Ken Gaub. (chuckles)

281
00:15:02.353 --> 00:15:03.613
I laughed right out loud.

282
00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:05.564
I said, "You're crazy.

283
00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:06.610
"That's impossible."

284
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.658
And then I thought, I know what it is.

285
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:13.189
It's candid camera or a set up of some kind.

286
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:16.453
So I'm looking around, checking my hair and everything.

287
00:15:16.453 --> 00:15:19.588
And I heard somebody saying,

288
00:15:19.588 --> 00:15:22.425
"I believe that's him, I believe that's him."

289
00:15:22.425 --> 00:15:24.622
And the operator said, "Well, is Ken Gaub there?"

290
00:15:24.622 --> 00:15:26.659
And I said, "Yes, I'm Ken Gaub."

291
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:28.355
She said, "Are you sure?"

292
00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:31.555
I said, "As far as I know, I'm Ken Gaub."

293
00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:34.861
And then the moment I'm talking to this lady,

294
00:15:34.861 --> 00:15:39.861
who in a desperate time had written a suicide note.

295
00:15:40.888 --> 00:15:43.586
<v ->The woman, many, many miles away</v>

296
00:15:43.586 --> 00:15:46.103
who had once seen him on a TV show,

297
00:15:46.103 --> 00:15:50.487
remembered how wonderful his ministry was,

298
00:15:50.487 --> 00:15:53.889
and how he had said just the right things for her that day.

299
00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:58.326
She was suicidal, and thought, "If I could just talk

300
00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:01.505
"to that wonderful man one more time.

301
00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:03.222
"But how would I ever find him?"

302
00:16:03.222 --> 00:16:05.579
And she was given numbers.

303
00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:09.782
She just saw a little collection of numbers in her mind.

304
00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:12.587
She called and gave those numbers to the long distance

305
00:16:12.587 --> 00:16:16.245
operator, who placed the call to the phone booth.

306
00:16:16.245 --> 00:16:19.572
<v ->And I'm thinking, "How can this be?</v>

307
00:16:19.572 --> 00:16:22.676
"What are the odds that somebody calls somebody

308
00:16:22.676 --> 00:16:27.412
"from another state, and it be the right phone number

309
00:16:27.412 --> 00:16:29.215
"and the right guy walking by?"

310
00:16:29.215 --> 00:16:32.158
There, I don't know if the odds are one a billion or what,

311
00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.313
but what are the odds of this?

312
00:16:34.313 --> 00:16:37.757
And I talked with her and was telling her that

313
00:16:37.757 --> 00:16:41.694
suicide's not the answer.

314
00:16:41.694 --> 00:16:43.949
Okay, bye bye.

315
00:16:46.056 --> 00:16:48.289
Whew.

316
00:16:48.289 --> 00:16:49.714
<v Voiceover>Ken stayed in contact with the woman</v>

317
00:16:49.714 --> 00:16:53.074
for several months, counseling her regularly until he knew

318
00:16:53.074 --> 00:16:55.794
that her suicidal thoughts were behind her.

319
00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:59.026
And that story kind of took a turn from

320
00:16:59.026 --> 00:17:04.026
me helping this lady to actually God helping me.

321
00:17:05.312 --> 00:17:06.521
Hey, Barbara.

322
00:17:06.521 --> 00:17:08.457
God knows where we are.

323
00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:13.992
<v Voiceover>A woman from Mexico, Teresa Juarez,</v>

324
00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.328
tells of an experience in which her doctor

325
00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:20.343
had given up on her, and she was not expected to live.

326
00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:28.295
<v ->(translated) They found a cancerous tumor in my brain.</v>

327
00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:33.201
And the doctor said that this tumor was completely developed

328
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:35.910
throughout my whole brain.

329
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.385
Those were his words, and he said,

330
00:17:38.385 --> 00:17:41.691
"You won't live for even six months more."

331
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:44.187 line:15% 
So I felt very upset.

332
00:17:44.187 --> 00:17:49.187 line:15% 
I prayed, and I cried, and one day,

333
00:17:49.989 --> 00:17:53.454
I heard that the statue of the virgin of Fatima

334
00:17:53.454 --> 00:17:56.195
was traveling to Juarez.

335
00:17:56.195 --> 00:18:00.056
So I went to the church where the virgin was,

336
00:18:00.056 --> 00:18:01.336
feeling very desperate.

337
00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:06.200
I wanted to live, so when I went into the church

338
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.794
where the virgin was, I prayed to her,

339
00:18:09.794 --> 00:18:12.674
and I said, "Holy mother, if you have all the power

340
00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:16.716
"that your son has, heal me, or do your will with me."

341
00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:22.859
When I did that, I felt like something was pulling my hair,

342
00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:25.781
and I felt on the right side of my face,

343
00:18:25.781 --> 00:18:27.912
I felt like something was buzzing,

344
00:18:27.912 --> 00:18:32.029
and I also felt, well, I wanted to cry,

345
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:33.747
I wanted to scream.

346
00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:38.333
I don't know, I felt like there was an intense heat

347
00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:41.447
came into me, and they had to take me out of the church

348
00:18:41.447 --> 00:18:42.917
because I cried and I cried,

349
00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:46.329
and I kept on crying until I finally rested.

350
00:18:46.329 --> 00:18:48.869
<v Voiceover>Following this mysterious episode,</v>

351
00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:51.834
Teresa returned to her doctor, fully convinced

352
00:18:51.834 --> 00:18:54.116
that she had been healed.

353
00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:56.836
<v ->(translated) So we went back to the doctor the next day,</v>

354
00:18:56.836 --> 00:18:59.502
and I said to him that I wanted him to do

355
00:18:59.502 --> 00:19:01.294
another test on me because I felt sure

356
00:19:01.294 --> 00:19:03.140
that there was nothing wrong with me anymore.

357
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.377
And he said no.

358
00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:08.099
He said that they had given me 35 radiation treatments,

359
00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:11.032
that my brain was still too inflamed.

360
00:19:11.032 --> 00:19:14.296
and he said we're not gonna find anything out

361
00:19:14.296 --> 00:19:16.760
from a test now because your brain is too inflamed.

362
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.419
But I insisted so much with him that he finally

363
00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:24.472
sent me to do another test, and then when we went back

364
00:19:24.472 --> 00:19:27.053
for the results, he said to my daughter,

365
00:19:27.053 --> 00:19:28.578
"Do you know how to read in English?"

366
00:19:28.578 --> 00:19:30.540
And my daughter said, "Yeah, I do."

367
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.897
And he said, "Okay, here's the envelope.

368
00:19:33.897 --> 00:19:35.315
"Open it up so that you could see

369
00:19:35.315 --> 00:19:37.171
"the results of your mother's test."

370
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:39.571
And before she opened it, he reminded us,

371
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:42.291
he said, "Your mother's cancer is incurable,

372
00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:44.894
"and it's throughout her whole brain."

373
00:19:44.894 --> 00:19:47.656
So my daughter opened up the envelope,

374
00:19:47.656 --> 00:19:49.416
and when she looked at the test results,

375
00:19:49.416 --> 00:19:50.900
she turned to the doctor and said,

376
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.373
"Look, this test says that there's not even

377
00:19:53.373 --> 00:19:55.176
a trace of cancer left."

378
00:19:55.176 --> 00:19:56.999
And the doctor grabbed the paper,

379
00:19:56.999 --> 00:19:59.730
and he started reading it for himself.

380
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.591
And he said, "Well, I, the only explanation

381
00:20:03.591 --> 00:20:06.002
"I can find for this, it just has to be a miracle

382
00:20:06.002 --> 00:20:09.649
"because I know that you had an incurable cancer.

383
00:20:09.649 --> 00:20:12.167
"There was no help for that."

384
00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:15.260
And I said, "Well, maybe for science

385
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.648
"there's no answer to this, but for God, there is."

386
00:20:18.648 --> 00:20:20.386
And to me, the most important thing

387
00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:24.568
is that God has healed me, and I am healthy now.

388
00:20:27.398 --> 00:20:30.370
And I give glory to God that he healed me

389
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.722
because of my faith, but you know it's because

390
00:20:33.722 --> 00:20:37.490
I placed a lot of faith in God, and I have a lot of faith

391
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.244
that I'm healthy and that I'm not going to get sick agian.

392
00:20:41.244 --> 00:20:44.870
In fact, I threw out all the pills, every one.

393
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.145
I'm not taking any now, and since about a year

394
00:20:48.145 --> 00:20:50.641
and four months ago, I haven't taken a thing.

395
00:20:50.641 --> 00:20:54.037
And I give glory to God because I'm fine now.

396
00:20:56.898 --> 00:20:58.892
<v ->Deborah Deckelman was a woman</v>

397
00:20:58.892 --> 00:21:00.737
facing her own emotional darkness

398
00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:04.123
when she was visited by a mysterious stranger.

399
00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:07.906
<v ->Well, my experience happened about 11 years ago,</v>

400
00:21:07.906 --> 00:21:12.906 line:15% 
and I was going through a series of tragedies in my life

401
00:21:12.993 --> 00:21:16.001 line:15% 
to where I had two close friends

402
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:18.881
who were killed in a car accident.

403
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:24.393
I had a miscarriage, lost my grandmother,

404
00:21:24.393 --> 00:21:29.393
and I was dealing with some joint custody problems.

405
00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:33.513
I was contemplating suicide, and it got to the point

406
00:21:33.513 --> 00:21:36.691
where I decided that the fastest way to do it

407
00:21:36.691 --> 00:21:40.531
was, would be to take the gun and shoot myself.

408
00:21:40.531 --> 00:21:45.531
But, I called my husband, he came home.

409
00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:50.194
We went into a hospital, and I was admitted there.

410
00:21:50.194 --> 00:21:53.673
It was a depression clinic, and I was always laying

411
00:21:53.673 --> 00:21:56.220
on the bed and sobbing and crying.

412
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.319
My hands were over my eyes.

413
00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:02.620
I heard this beautiful voice say Deborah,

414
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.086
and she said, "Can I come around and talk with you?"

415
00:22:06.086 --> 00:22:09.704
And I took my hands down, and I looked up at her,

416
00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:13.201
and I said yes, and I was still crying.

417
00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:14.524
And she came around.

418
00:22:14.524 --> 00:22:16.998
She's a grandmotherly type woman,

419
00:22:16.998 --> 00:22:19.552
and she says, "I know what you're thinking

420
00:22:19.552 --> 00:22:21.093
"and you're feeling right now."

421
00:22:21.093 --> 00:22:22.256
She says, "You're feeling like you're in this

422
00:22:22.256 --> 00:22:26.171
"pit of darkness and there's no hope for you."

423
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:29.733
And that's what I was thinking.

424
00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:34.733
She knew me inside and out, and she says,

425
00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:38.724
"I'm here to tell you this is what God wants you to do.

426
00:22:40.074 --> 00:22:42.820
"He wants you to take it just one day at a time,

427
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.777
"and scratch away at that darkness, just a little bit,

428
00:22:46.777 --> 00:22:48.893
"just scratch away just a little bit

429
00:22:48.893 --> 00:22:51.886
and you'll see this crack, and in the crack,

430
00:22:51.886 --> 00:22:54.819
"every day you do this, you'll see it open and a little

431
00:22:54.819 --> 00:22:58.627
"bit more light will come through, and everyday,

432
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.964
"more and more light will come through for you."

433
00:23:00.964 --> 00:23:03.149
And she says, "Do you know what that is?"

434
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:05.948
She said, "That is God's love and promise

435
00:23:05.948 --> 00:23:08.621
"for you that you must go on."

436
00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:12.695
She put one hand on my forehead and one on my heart,

437
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:17.580
and as we prayed, it was like someone

438
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.162
brought the sun from the sky

439
00:23:20.162 --> 00:23:23.617
and into that pit of darkness I had,

440
00:23:23.617 --> 00:23:27.500
and it was all over me, and all through me,

441
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.881
and I was being embraced by God.

442
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:34.475
I was being comforted and loved in such a way

443
00:23:34.475 --> 00:23:36.662
I had never felt before.

444
00:23:36.662 --> 00:23:40.960
And I looked up, and it was just pure light.

445
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.563
My mind and my heart were healed.

446
00:23:43.563 --> 00:23:46.976
The depression was gone, totally lifted.

447
00:23:46.976 --> 00:23:51.976
She went out the door passed directly next to the nurse

448
00:23:53.055 --> 00:23:57.204
who was coming in at the time, and I asked the nurse

449
00:23:57.204 --> 00:24:01.556
who this wonderful radiant person was

450
00:24:01.556 --> 00:24:04.841
that just made me feel so loved,

451
00:24:04.841 --> 00:24:08.723
and the nurse said, "Who was who?"

452
00:24:08.723 --> 00:24:11.283
<v Voiceover>No one but Deborah had seen a woman,</v>

453
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.481
and according to the hospital, she was neither

454
00:24:13.481 --> 00:24:16.937
an employee nor a volunteer.

455
00:24:16.937 --> 00:24:21.937
<v ->I got up the next morning, and I got out of bed</v>

456
00:24:22.675 --> 00:24:25.042
and I went over to the window, and I opened the blinds,

457
00:24:25.042 --> 00:24:29.160
and right there in front of me at the window

458
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.741
was this big beautiful rainbow

459
00:24:31.741 --> 00:24:34.717
and the colors were so brilliant and beautiful.

460
00:24:34.717 --> 00:24:37.982
It was my confirmation that God was telling me again

461
00:24:37.982 --> 00:24:39.335
See?

462
00:24:39.335 --> 00:24:42.332
My promises are good.

463
00:24:42.332 --> 00:24:45.713
My experience lead to having forums, and it also

464
00:24:45.713 --> 00:24:48.561
brought to me many special people.

465
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:51.196
<v Voiceover>Deborah felt compelled to share her story</v>

466
00:24:51.196 --> 00:24:52.998
with a small group.

467
00:24:52.998 --> 00:24:54.960
So many people responded with their own

468
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.955 line:15% 
remarkable stories that Deborah

469
00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.944 line:15% 
organized a forum.

470
00:24:58.944 --> 00:25:01.776 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>On the town square in Handover, Pennsylvania,</v>

471
00:25:01.776 --> 00:25:04.571 line:15% 
in a converted store room above a gift shop

472
00:25:04.571 --> 00:25:08.859 line:15% 
called The Rose Trellis, there's a special meeting going on.

473
00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:11.119
Welcome to the second meeting of over.

474
00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:12.762
<v Voiceover>Nearly 500 people gathered</v>

475
00:25:12.762 --> 00:25:15.685
from hundreds of miles around to share their own stories,

476
00:25:15.685 --> 00:25:18.319
and to hear the experiences of others.

477
00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:21.328
One of the persons to attend Deborah's forum

478
00:25:21.328 --> 00:25:24.048
was a gentleman called Albert Gorsuch.

479
00:25:24.048 --> 00:25:27.333
He was a self-professed workaholic

480
00:25:27.333 --> 00:25:29.146
with a responsible job and a family

481
00:25:29.146 --> 00:25:32.655
that depended on him, and then he began drinking.

482
00:25:37.195 --> 00:25:39.567
<v ->I couldn't wait in the morning to start drinking,</v>

483
00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:43.757 line:15% 
and then I got into gambling,

484
00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.421
and so on.

485
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:50.343
So then I, this went on for several years

486
00:25:51.623 --> 00:25:55.023
with my wife and the next morning,

487
00:25:55.023 --> 00:25:57.476
she could be out in the kitchen making breakfast,

488
00:25:57.476 --> 00:26:00.100
and she would be out there singing,

489
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.864
and go on and said, "God, how can she do these things?"

490
00:26:03.864 --> 00:26:06.446
How can it be that she can do these things

491
00:26:06.446 --> 00:26:10.190
when she knew what I'd been doing?

492
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.995
I would try to hide part of it from her,

493
00:26:12.995 --> 00:26:14.797
especially the gambling part.

494
00:26:16.357 --> 00:26:21.295
And one day, my boss came up and he said, "Albert."

495
00:26:21.295 --> 00:26:24.184
I had been bringing a man in two years for me

496
00:26:24.184 --> 00:26:28.431
on my job, and he said, "I can't pay

497
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:33.431
"two of you on for this job, and I would like you to retire.

498
00:26:33.448 --> 00:26:36.028
"You're old enough to retire."

499
00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:41.028
Well, that's the day that the earth crashed around me.

500
00:26:41.287 --> 00:26:43.047
<v Voiceover>The only solution Albert could see</v>

501
00:26:43.047 --> 00:26:46.620
to his dismal future was to remove himself from the picture.

502
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.663
I went out and got in my car and I started down a road,

503
00:26:50.663 --> 00:26:55.185
and I was crying and I didn't want to commit suicide,

504
00:26:55.185 --> 00:26:57.307
but God hadn't answered my prayers.

505
00:26:57.307 --> 00:26:59.964
He hadn't helped me any, and I was crying.

506
00:26:59.964 --> 00:27:01.724
I prayed all the way down the road.

507
00:27:01.724 --> 00:27:06.203
I said, "God, can I, is there no help for me?"

508
00:27:06.203 --> 00:27:10.150
But I never got an answer, and so then I stopped

509
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.351
on the bridge and got out of my car.

510
00:27:14.351 --> 00:27:17.115
And then I started to walk to the rail.

511
00:27:17.115 --> 00:27:22.115
This something, a force, just took hold me,

512
00:27:22.533 --> 00:27:27.533
and lifted me up my feet and took me back to my car.

513
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:32.260
And I said, "Oh, God. Is this an angel?"

514
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.300
I don't know how we got over on Ivy Mill Road,

515
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.564
which is about a mile away, but it was off the road.

516
00:27:38.564 --> 00:27:43.342
And whatever it was, had me in its arms,

517
00:27:43.342 --> 00:27:46.115
and I, it was like a cloak,

518
00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:49.817
and I was like a little baby in its arms.

519
00:27:49.817 --> 00:27:52.206
<v Voiceover>To Albert, time stood still.</v>

520
00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:53.646
When he finally calmed down,

521
00:27:53.646 --> 00:27:55.523
Albert claims that the comforting voice

522
00:27:55.523 --> 00:27:58.349
would not leave him until it received assurance

523
00:27:58.349 --> 00:28:00.504
that he would be alright.

524
00:28:00.504 --> 00:28:03.533
<v ->When it finally was over with,</v>

525
00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:08.533
the voice said to me, "God isn't done with you yet, son.

526
00:28:09.837 --> 00:28:11.777
"God isn't done with you yet."

527
00:28:11.777 --> 00:28:14.239
<v Voiceover>Albert turned his life around completely,</v>

528
00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:16.532
and today tells his story whenever possible

529
00:28:16.532 --> 00:28:20.569
of how his life was saved by an unexplainable presence.

530
00:28:21.918 --> 00:28:25.752
(soft flute music)

531
00:28:26.974 --> 00:28:28.402
(playful flute music)

532
00:28:28.402 --> 00:28:30.034
A few minutes on the internet can turn up

533
00:28:30.034 --> 00:28:32.679
chatlines and bulletin boards in which people

534
00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:35.879
openly share their miraculous experiences.

535
00:28:35.879 --> 00:28:38.801
Paul Robert Walker used this technology

536
00:28:38.801 --> 00:28:41.541
to help him locate stories for his book,

537
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:44.145
Every Day's a Miracle.

538
00:28:44.145 --> 00:28:46.406
<v ->Sometimes, though, just by reading through the postings,</v>

539
00:28:46.406 --> 00:28:48.764
I would come across an amazing story.

540
00:28:48.764 --> 00:28:50.065
Like right here.

541
00:28:50.065 --> 00:28:53.265
He writes, "I also had an experience with an angel.

542
00:28:53.265 --> 00:28:55.820
"And I believe firmly that it is the only

543
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.682
"explanation to this story of mine.

544
00:28:57.682 --> 00:29:00.349
"One night, I was coming home from work on the interstate.

545
00:29:00.349 --> 00:29:04.125
"It was July 4th, and approximately 11:45 PM.

546
00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:06.290
"I was getting ready to get on the exit ramp

547
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.924
"when my steering wheel sharply turned to the left,

548
00:29:08.924 --> 00:29:11.623
"putting me in the fast lane of the interstate.

549
00:29:11.623 --> 00:29:14.545
"Seconds later, a car came speeding

550
00:29:14.545 --> 00:29:17.606
"the wrong way down the exit ramp I was about to enter.

551
00:29:17.606 --> 00:29:20.444
"If I had exited on that ramp, my passenger and I

552
00:29:20.444 --> 00:29:23.185
"would surely have been killed in a head-on accident.

553
00:29:23.185 --> 00:29:25.521
"There was no sign of that car when I was about to exit,

554
00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:28.742
"but surely my angel must've seen what was about to happen.

555
00:29:28.742 --> 00:29:31.749
"This occurred in 1981, and I still remember

556
00:29:31.749 --> 00:29:34.469
"to thank my angel for saving my life."

557
00:29:34.469 --> 00:29:36.560
It's an amazing story, I think,

558
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.781
and it's right there online.

559
00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:40.986
And we go down the list.

560
00:29:40.986 --> 00:29:43.962
Now here's a posting entitled Quantum Physics,

561
00:29:43.962 --> 00:29:46.106
which is interesting to me because it sounds like

562
00:29:46.106 --> 00:29:48.450
it echos some of the same ideas I'd been thinking about

563
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.831
in terms of the application of the new breakthroughs

564
00:29:51.831 --> 00:29:55.671
in physics to the possibility of miracles.

565
00:29:55.671 --> 00:29:58.102
"The old Newtonian physics did away with God

566
00:29:58.102 --> 00:30:00.385
"in its mechanistic outlook of the universe.

567
00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:02.998
"Quantum Physics has returned God to us.

568
00:30:02.998 --> 00:30:05.099
"Mystics through the ages have always known

569
00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:07.158
"that there was a higher power that was an intrinsic

570
00:30:07.158 --> 00:30:10.016
"part of everything that exists within ourselves,

571
00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:11.776
"the world, and the entire universe.

572
00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:14.037
"They knew that God or the Light existed within.

573
00:30:14.037 --> 00:30:15.786
"Quantum physicists are now agreeing

574
00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:17.621
"with this very same outlook.

575
00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:19.744
"They are now saying that all matter is energy,

576
00:30:19.744 --> 00:30:21.717
"and that on the sub-atomic level,

577
00:30:21.717 --> 00:30:24.105
"this same energy exists in everything.

578
00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:26.282
"They do not understand it and cannot describe it,

579
00:30:26.282 --> 00:30:28.682
"only that it exists, but they recognize that

580
00:30:28.682 --> 00:30:31.636
"it is this energy that is the cause of all existence.

581
00:30:31.636 --> 00:30:33.578
"Sounds like God to me."

582
00:30:33.578 --> 00:30:36.265
It's nice, I think, It's nice.

583
00:30:36.265 --> 00:30:39.593
<v Voiceover>Supreme court Justice Antonin Scalia</v>

584
00:30:39.593 --> 00:30:41.342
in a speech about religion in the

585
00:30:41.342 --> 00:30:44.041
age of scientific skepticism concluded

586
00:30:44.041 --> 00:30:48.702
with an ardent defense with the existence of miracles.

587
00:30:48.702 --> 00:30:52.382
A 1996 poll taken for TIME Magazine and CNN

588
00:30:52.382 --> 00:30:55.570
discovered that 82% of Americans believe

589
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.174
in the healing power of personal prayer.

590
00:30:58.174 --> 00:31:01.950
64% believed that doctors should join their patients

591
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.330
in prayer if the patients request it.

592
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.709
Clearly, there are a lot of people out there

593
00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:09.725
who do believe in miracles.

594
00:31:09.725 --> 00:31:12.466
The public seems hungry for these stories,

595
00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:15.143
and readers can hardly get enough of them.

596
00:31:15.143 --> 00:31:17.810
Are people more interested now than they were

597
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:22.108
at other times in history with the issue of spirituality?

598
00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:24.103
<v ->There's clearly renewed interest today</v>

599
00:31:24.103 --> 00:31:26.618 line:15% 
in the spiritual world, angels and

600
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:30.365 line:15% 
miracles and the afterlife, and I think to a great extent,

601
00:31:30.365 --> 00:31:34.513
it's simply a reaction to the material explosion

602
00:31:34.513 --> 00:31:37.266
of the 20th century, and that we've come to the realization

603
00:31:37.266 --> 00:31:39.687
that we can have all the material things

604
00:31:39.687 --> 00:31:42.204
that we could imagine, but there's still a deeper

605
00:31:42.204 --> 00:31:45.788
kind of happiness that lies in a spiritual understanding.

606
00:31:45.788 --> 00:31:48.647
But I also think it has a lot to do with the millennium.

607
00:31:48.647 --> 00:31:53.425
There is a unifying hope, I think,

608
00:31:53.425 --> 00:31:56.710
that the millennium will mark a new level

609
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.545
of consciousness for the human race.

610
00:31:58.545 --> 00:31:59.963
Perhaps a better point of view,

611
00:31:59.963 --> 00:32:02.608
a better understanding, a better way of living.

612
00:32:02.608 --> 00:32:05.514
And I think that expectation

613
00:32:05.514 --> 00:32:07.813
leads to renewed spiritual activity.

614
00:32:07.813 --> 00:32:10.875
Do you think you've ever experienced a miracle?

615
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:15.152
We asked people if they believed in miracles.

616
00:32:15.152 --> 00:32:17.050
<v ->Yes, I believe in miracles.</v>

617
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:20.090
<v ->Well, yes from the standpoint of</v>

618
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.199
I believe there's divine intelligence

619
00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:24.396
that directs the universe.

620
00:32:24.396 --> 00:32:27.970
No from the standpoint of if you're asking me

621
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.433
if God creates miracles.

622
00:32:30.433 --> 00:32:32.398
<v ->I don't know that I necessarily</v>

623
00:32:32.398 --> 00:32:33.998
do or don't believe in miracles.

624
00:32:33.998 --> 00:32:35.993
I don't know that I've ever experienced one.

625
00:32:35.993 --> 00:32:37.901
<v ->I do believe in miracles.</v>

626
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:39.875
<v ->I think they happen everyday, and people just</v>

627
00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:42.158
don't realize it or won't accept it.

628
00:32:42.158 --> 00:32:44.813
<v ->I don't think it's some spirit that's guiding us.</v>

629
00:32:44.813 --> 00:32:46.381
I think it's right here in our own heads

630
00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:49.517
that's letting us do that, and that's the miracle.

631
00:32:49.517 --> 00:32:52.216
The miracle is your own brain.

632
00:32:52.216 --> 00:32:54.520
<v Voiceover>Next, we asked if anyone</v>

633
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.994
had ever experienced a miracle.

634
00:32:56.994 --> 00:32:58.818
<v ->Actually, a miracle I believe happened to</v>

635
00:32:58.818 --> 00:33:01.815
my family about six or seven weeks ago.

636
00:33:01.815 --> 00:33:05.111
My little boy fell out of our second story window

637
00:33:05.111 --> 00:33:10.111
onto our concrete, and basically walked away uninjured.

638
00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:14.998
And I just feel like something or someone

639
00:33:14.998 --> 00:33:18.902
helped him in his fall, and it led me to

640
00:33:18.902 --> 00:33:21.654
believe that there are miracles.

641
00:33:21.654 --> 00:33:23.552
You do hear about them, I read about them in the paper.

642
00:33:23.552 --> 00:33:26.291
<v ->I had several experiences, and it happened to have taken</v>

643
00:33:26.291 --> 00:33:29.213
place in a car in a life-threatening situation.

644
00:33:29.213 --> 00:33:32.531
And the first one is about 15 years ago,

645
00:33:32.531 --> 00:33:37.128
and I was driving home from my parents' house,

646
00:33:37.128 --> 00:33:39.319
and I was driving on a two-lane road

647
00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:41.565
through the artichoke fields.

648
00:33:41.565 --> 00:33:44.814
So it took a shortcut, and it had very steep embankments

649
00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:46.221
down at the fields on either side

650
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:47.768
and I guess I'd fallen asleep.

651
00:33:49.538 --> 00:33:52.972
And someone grabbed me by the right shoulder, shook me,

652
00:33:52.972 --> 00:33:57.047
and a voice, neither male or female, really,

653
00:33:57.047 --> 00:33:59.650
but really urgently said, "Janni, wake up."

654
00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:00.855
And I felt the breath on my cheek,

655
00:34:00.855 --> 00:34:03.554
and I opened my eyes, and I was completely alone in the car,

656
00:34:03.554 --> 00:34:06.017
and I pulled the steering wheel back,

657
00:34:06.017 --> 00:34:09.153
and I just barely, barely got back from the edge

658
00:34:09.153 --> 00:34:11.415
of the embankment there.

659
00:34:11.415 --> 00:34:14.209
<v ->I was about to cross the street, and when I</v>

660
00:34:14.209 --> 00:34:17.899
I reached the curb, something told me to stop.

661
00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:20.715
A split second later, a bus drove in front of me

662
00:34:20.715 --> 00:34:23.338
very fast about two inches in front of my face.

663
00:34:23.338 --> 00:34:24.811
<v ->We were building this new antenna,</v>

664
00:34:24.811 --> 00:34:28.416
and we needed a place to put a guywire

665
00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:32.298
to support that pole, and we realized we

666
00:34:32.298 --> 00:34:34.133
were very close to these high suspension lines

667
00:34:34.133 --> 00:34:36.224
and we had to be careful where we put it.

668
00:34:36.224 --> 00:34:40.206
The wire rope hit the high tension line, that outer line,

669
00:34:40.206 --> 00:34:41.845
and it knocked me to the ground.

670
00:34:41.845 --> 00:34:43.167
They didn't want to discharge me.

671
00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:45.524
They kept me in that day and that night,

672
00:34:45.524 --> 00:34:48.180
the next day, and they did a treadmill and a cardiogram

673
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.889
and all kinds of tests on me and they just shook their

674
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.735
head and you know, they keep saying,

675
00:34:52.735 --> 00:34:54.377
"How many volts was that?"

676
00:34:54.377 --> 00:34:55.732
And I said, "Well, the lineman said it was

677
00:34:55.732 --> 00:34:58.249
"13,800 volts from face to ground."

678
00:34:58.249 --> 00:35:00.073
And they just shook their head and said,

679
00:35:00.073 --> 00:35:01.643
"You're a very lucky man."

680
00:35:01.643 --> 00:35:06.136
The only way they knew how to say I was blessed,

681
00:35:06.136 --> 00:35:10.006
but they discharged me the next day and I was fine.

682
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.800
()soft piano music)

683
00:35:20.749 --> 00:35:22.098
<v Voiceover>Among the growing collection</v>

684
00:35:22.098 --> 00:35:25.175
of miracle researchers is Jodie Berndt.

685
00:35:25.175 --> 00:35:27.458
Her book, Celebration of Miracles,

686
00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:30.167
written for Thomas Nelson Bible Publishers,

687
00:35:30.167 --> 00:35:33.277
was inspired by a personal experience.

688
00:35:33.277 --> 00:35:35.581
<v ->I became interested in the subject of miracles</v>

689
00:35:35.581 --> 00:35:37.869 line:15% 
several years ago when my sister,

690
00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:39.418 line:15% 
who was in high school at the time,

691
00:35:39.418 --> 00:35:43.418 line:15% 
was diagnosed with colon cancer, which was a real rare

692
00:35:43.418 --> 00:35:46.095
form of cancer for someone as young as she was,

693
00:35:46.095 --> 00:35:51.095
and which we later learned was had a real low cure rate.

694
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.211
They had done some studies that had shown that

695
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:57.230
no one as a teenager or childhood

696
00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.056
come down with colon cancer survived.

697
00:36:00.056 --> 00:36:03.573
So we knew that this was a serious thing,

698
00:36:03.573 --> 00:36:05.880
and Jennifer, I think, fully believed

699
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.979
that God would heal her.

700
00:36:06.979 --> 00:36:08.962
That's what she wanted to believe, and she prayed,

701
00:36:08.962 --> 00:36:11.778
and as it turned out, she did have a tumor.

702
00:36:11.778 --> 00:36:13.602
It was the size of a grapefruit, and when the doctors

703
00:36:13.602 --> 00:36:16.973
went in to remove it, they were amazed because

704
00:36:16.973 --> 00:36:19.234
as one of the surgeons put it, "The nature of cancer

705
00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:23.041
"is to grow, and yet it had contained itself."

706
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:24.876
They'd never heard of a cancer doing that.

707
00:36:24.876 --> 00:36:27.116
And so once they removed the tumor,

708
00:36:27.116 --> 00:36:28.919
they had envisioned that she would need

709
00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:30.476
radiation, chemotherapy.

710
00:36:30.476 --> 00:36:32.160
They told her not to plan to go to college

711
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.240
because she'd be having these treatments

712
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.054
and they sent her off to a specialist

713
00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:39.659
at Georgetown University Medical Center

714
00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:42.058
who ran additional tests on her and found

715
00:36:42.058 --> 00:36:44.298
that she was completely clean,

716
00:36:44.298 --> 00:36:47.498
and the doctors have called her a miracle.

717
00:36:47.498 --> 00:36:50.336
I just got more and more interested,

718
00:36:50.336 --> 00:36:53.376
and as I did so, I began to meet other people

719
00:36:53.376 --> 00:36:56.597
and talk to other people who'd seen God work in their lives.

720
00:36:56.597 --> 00:36:59.637
I love how one of the fellas I talk to

721
00:36:59.637 --> 00:37:01.994
in preparation for my book responded to this.

722
00:37:01.994 --> 00:37:03.135
There was a pastor.

723
00:37:03.135 --> 00:37:05.460
His name was Duane Miller, and really,

724
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.954
his story was one of the most remarkable

725
00:37:06.954 --> 00:37:08.825
that I had heard, and I say heard

726
00:37:08.825 --> 00:37:10.857
because I really did get to hear it.

727
00:37:10.857 --> 00:37:14.142
He sent me an audiotape, and he was a pastor in Texas

728
00:37:14.142 --> 00:37:19.006
who after a bout with the flu, lost the use of his voice.

729
00:37:23.026 --> 00:37:25.252
<v ->I was left with a pressure in my throat,</v>

730
00:37:25.252 --> 00:37:26.628 line:15% 
and pressure's the only way I know to describe

731
00:37:26.628 --> 00:37:29.955 line:15% 
the feeling, and it was as if someone had my windpipe

732
00:37:29.955 --> 00:37:32.697
between their thumb and forefinger and was squeezing it.

733
00:37:32.697 --> 00:37:36.782
I sounded like this, and it felt like that.

734
00:37:36.782 --> 00:37:40.525
And it felt that way for the next three years of my life.

735
00:37:40.525 --> 00:37:43.139
I went through a myriad of tests with doctors.

736
00:37:43.139 --> 00:37:44.376
They did everything they could,

737
00:37:44.376 --> 00:37:46.381
trying to determine what was wrong.

738
00:37:46.381 --> 00:37:48.941
Ultimately referred me to doctors around the country.

739
00:37:48.941 --> 00:37:50.296
I've seen doctors from Europe.

740
00:37:50.296 --> 00:37:51.799
I've seen doctors from Japan.

741
00:37:51.799 --> 00:37:54.829
I've seen doctors from Los Angeles,

742
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:57.506
Philadelphia, New York, Houston.

743
00:37:57.506 --> 00:37:59.948
I've seen doctors from most everywhere,

744
00:37:59.948 --> 00:38:02.913
and they all arrived, ultimately, at the conclusion

745
00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:04.727
that when I had that flu virus, it got into

746
00:38:04.727 --> 00:38:06.475
the nerves of my vocal cords.

747
00:38:06.475 --> 00:38:08.939
It was able to penetrates the myelin sheath,

748
00:38:08.939 --> 00:38:10.945
which is like an insulation around the nerves,

749
00:38:10.945 --> 00:38:12.726
and it ultimately destroyed the nerves

750
00:38:12.726 --> 00:38:16.459
in my throat, in my vocal box, vocal chords

751
00:38:16.459 --> 00:38:17.972
so that they did not function.

752
00:38:17.972 --> 00:38:19.710
They just hung limply.

753
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:22.555
They gave me a prognosis, ultimately,

754
00:38:22.555 --> 00:38:24.742
that said that I would not recover,

755
00:38:24.742 --> 00:38:27.504
and that the speech that I was able to generate,

756
00:38:27.504 --> 00:38:30.384
I was generating with some fatty tissues

757
00:38:30.384 --> 00:38:31.406
that were called false chords

758
00:38:31.406 --> 00:38:32.462
that are in your throat, but they're not

759
00:38:32.462 --> 00:38:35.587
designed to sustain speech, and they told me that

760
00:38:35.587 --> 00:38:39.242
ultimately, I would wear away the false chords surfaces

761
00:38:39.242 --> 00:38:41.086
to the point that they could no longer get together

762
00:38:41.086 --> 00:38:42.900
and I would be totally mute.

763
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.452
They predicted that should all occur by late '94

764
00:38:46.452 --> 00:38:49.972
or early '95, I should be totally mute.

765
00:38:49.972 --> 00:38:51.316
That was their word.

766
00:38:51.316 --> 00:38:53.492
All of that is observable on video tape.

767
00:38:53.492 --> 00:38:57.150
The doctors ran like timelapse photography.

768
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.016
Every time I would go see them, they would

769
00:38:59.016 --> 00:39:01.352
put the scope down my throat and record all of that.

770
00:39:01.352 --> 00:39:05.946
So you could watch scar tissue actually form in my throat.

771
00:39:05.946 --> 00:39:08.709
My wife became the breadwinner of our family

772
00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:10.885
because we had to resign the pastorate where we were.

773
00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:12.303
I could no longer preach.

774
00:39:12.303 --> 00:39:13.263
I couldn't sustain that.

775
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:15.951
I couldn't go to a sales job because I couldn't make

776
00:39:15.951 --> 00:39:17.370
whole calls because I sounded like an obscene

777
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.687
phone caller, and the people would hang up on me.

778
00:39:21.997 --> 00:39:23.897
You know, you laugh about that now and it's amusing,

779
00:39:23.897 --> 00:39:27.214
but at the time, it's extremely frustrating.

780
00:39:28.624 --> 00:39:30.588
Emotionally, I was destroyed.

781
00:39:30.588 --> 00:39:32.710
Career-wise, I was set aside.

782
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.099
In many of the things that I thought

783
00:39:35.099 --> 00:39:37.894
were important in my life, I found myself at loose ends,

784
00:39:37.894 --> 00:39:41.553
and like other people, I asked God, "Why, why?"

785
00:39:43.363 --> 00:39:46.267
<v ->He was not expecting for God to heal him</v>

786
00:39:46.267 --> 00:39:48.528
at any given moment, and one day,

787
00:39:48.528 --> 00:39:50.085
he was teaching a Sunday school class,

788
00:39:50.085 --> 00:39:52.347
filling in for someone using a special microphone

789
00:39:52.347 --> 00:39:54.981
so that his listeners could catch his words.

790
00:39:54.981 --> 00:39:56.325
And he's rasping into the microphone,

791
00:39:56.325 --> 00:40:00.937
and as he's teaching about God out of Psalm 103

792
00:40:00.937 --> 00:40:03.738
how God forgives our sins and heals our diseases

793
00:40:03.738 --> 00:40:07.610
and redeems our life from the pit, something broke.

794
00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.447
In a church of 24,000 members,

795
00:40:10.447 --> 00:40:14.126
that's the only class that taped Sunday school lessons.

796
00:40:14.126 --> 00:40:16.046
So it was caught on tape.

797
00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:19.267
On the other hand, to say that since we don't have

798
00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:21.582
anything after the Book of Acts that miracles

799
00:40:21.582 --> 00:40:26.126
in the Book of Acts never happen again is equally as wrong.

800
00:40:26.126 --> 00:40:29.454
Because you have put God in a box both ways.

801
00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:31.032
He doesn't want to be in the box.

802
00:40:31.032 --> 00:40:33.863
So to Psalm, he says, I'm excited.

803
00:40:33.863 --> 00:40:35.623
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul.

804
00:40:35.623 --> 00:40:40.623
One of his best is he heals all of my diseases.

805
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.658
And then in verse four he says,

806
00:40:42.658 --> 00:40:47.266
and he redeems my life from the pit.

807
00:40:47.266 --> 00:40:50.806
And I like that verse just a whole lot.

808
00:40:50.806 --> 00:40:54.604
I have had and you have had in times

809
00:40:54.604 --> 00:40:57.783
past pit experiences.

810
00:41:01.233 --> 00:41:06.233
We've both had, we've all had times when

811
00:41:06.891 --> 00:41:11.891
our life seemed to be in a pit, in a grave,

812
00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:17.032
and we he didn't have an answer for ... (deeply inhales)

813
00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:25.457
the pit we find ourselves in, (deeply inhales)

814
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.026
And I don't understand this right now.

815
00:41:30.026 --> 00:41:33.951
(crowd laughs and applauds)

816
00:41:35.101 --> 00:41:40.101
I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment.

817
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:46.158
(hoarse breathing)

818
00:41:47.369 --> 00:41:51.326
I'm not quite sure what to say or do.

819
00:41:52.146 --> 00:41:55.655
(crowd cries and cheers in background)

820
00:41:56.165 --> 00:42:00.311
(deeply inhales)

821
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:10.331
I'm (chuckles) sounds funny to say,

822
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.352
a loss for words.

823
00:42:13.352 --> 00:42:16.759
(crowd laughs and cheers)

824
00:42:21.532 --> 00:42:23.517
And I have to tell you, I still am at a loss for words.

825
00:42:24.658 --> 00:42:26.033
<v ->The people in that Sunday school class</v>

826
00:42:26.033 --> 00:42:29.745
began to weep and clap and some were silent.

827
00:42:29.745 --> 00:42:31.526
Some were laughing.

828
00:42:31.526 --> 00:42:34.268
There was just an explosion of joy.

829
00:42:34.268 --> 00:42:35.953
<v ->That moment was wonderful,</v>

830
00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:38.513
and I thank God for what occurred,

831
00:42:38.513 --> 00:42:41.041
but the miracle doesn't end there.

832
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:42.576
You see, I've been back to the doctor's,

833
00:42:42.576 --> 00:42:44.688
and when I went back and they showed me the last piece

834
00:42:44.688 --> 00:42:46.683
of videotape that they shot of my throat,

835
00:42:46.683 --> 00:42:49.147
it shows that the scar tissue that had formed

836
00:42:49.147 --> 00:42:52.293
there is gone, and it's as slick smooth in the bottom

837
00:42:52.293 --> 00:42:55.290
of my throat as the day it all began.

838
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.829
Scar tissue doesn't disappear.

839
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:59.791
So even if you could coincidentally explain

840
00:42:59.791 --> 00:43:03.471
how I'm able to speak, what happened to the scar tissue?

841
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:05.384
That's the miracle.

842
00:43:10.078 --> 00:43:12.473
<v Voiceover>These stories have provoked questions</v>

843
00:43:12.473 --> 00:43:15.033
in the minds of those who have experienced them.

844
00:43:15.033 --> 00:43:17.124
Were these miracles?

845
00:43:17.124 --> 00:43:20.099
And if so, what do they say about life

846
00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:23.011
and the existence of a creator?

847
00:43:23.011 --> 00:43:26.275
These questions stare back at them, across the canyon

848
00:43:26.275 --> 00:43:30.029
which divides faith from rational explanation,

849
00:43:30.029 --> 00:43:34.268
and they have been left trying to find a bridge.

850
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:39.298
<v ->I do know that our life moves in the direction</v>

851
00:43:39.298 --> 00:43:42.498
of our most dominant thoughts.

852
00:43:42.498 --> 00:43:44.119
I think miracles.

853
00:43:44.119 --> 00:43:46.924
I think and believe for answers,

854
00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:49.207
and there have been times in my own life

855
00:43:49.207 --> 00:43:54.207
when I've been basically bankrupt and know which way to go,

856
00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:58.422
and miracles happen, just right out of the blue,

857
00:43:58.422 --> 00:44:00.726
and so I get excited about that because

858
00:44:00.726 --> 00:44:02.891
I know that God cares for us.

859
00:44:02.891 --> 00:44:07.606
<v ->Love is where God is, and if God is right here,</v>

860
00:44:07.606 --> 00:44:09.942
then love should be right here too.

861
00:44:09.942 --> 00:44:12.149
And it's all connected in a way.

862
00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.555
I think he shows us that as he

863
00:44:14.555 --> 00:44:16.979
performs these marvelous miracles,

864
00:44:16.979 --> 00:44:19.454
these little signs and wonders for us.

865
00:44:19.454 --> 00:44:22.792
The whole point of it is, I'm here and I love you.

866
00:44:22.792 --> 00:44:24.094
<v ->Faith, hope, and love.</v>

867
00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:26.515
Wonderful chemistry.

868
00:44:26.515 --> 00:44:28.392
Hope is an attitude, you see?

869
00:44:28.392 --> 00:44:29.800
Fear is an attitude.

870
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.367
So the people who have no hope,

871
00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:36.744
lots of fear, no faith, and no love.

872
00:44:36.744 --> 00:44:39.421
What are they foreseeing?

873
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:41.437
They live out what they foresee,

874
00:44:41.437 --> 00:44:43.175
which is death and suffering.

875
00:44:43.175 --> 00:44:45.116
And that's why there are physicians

876
00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:47.815
who can enhance death, you see,

877
00:44:47.815 --> 00:44:49.905
if every time you come to an office,

878
00:44:49.905 --> 00:44:51.857
your hope is taken away,

879
00:44:51.857 --> 00:44:54.044
love is poo-pooed, and there's nothing

880
00:44:54.044 --> 00:44:56.241
to have faith in except the doctor.

881
00:44:56.241 --> 00:44:58.022
You're going to die right on schedule,

882
00:44:58.022 --> 00:44:59.686
and the doctor says, "See, I told you.

883
00:44:59.686 --> 00:45:01.467
"What are you talking about, miracles?"

884
00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:02.939
Then you walk into another office,

885
00:45:02.939 --> 00:45:05.168
and the doctor says, "I love you.

886
00:45:05.168 --> 00:45:06.587
"What would you like to do?

887
00:45:06.587 --> 00:45:09.232
"Let me tell you what other people have done

888
00:45:09.232 --> 00:45:11.547
"who have exceeded our expectations."

889
00:45:11.547 --> 00:45:15.909
<v ->I think the more love you can put out,</v>

890
00:45:15.909 --> 00:45:17.712
the more love you're going to receive.

891
00:45:17.712 --> 00:45:20.911
This goes back to the idea of the response of universe.

892
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:24.687
Certainly, if you put out love into the universe

893
00:45:24.687 --> 00:45:27.386
and if you can put out unconditional love,

894
00:45:27.386 --> 00:45:30.127
you're going to receive unconditional love.

895
00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:34.969
<v ->I feel sometimes that all that is between</v>

896
00:45:34.969 --> 00:45:39.969
our wishes and God to accomplish what he wants for us,

897
00:45:40.366 --> 00:45:43.513
what he has planned for us is our prayer.

898
00:45:43.513 --> 00:45:47.011
That's all that is missing and he wants us to pray.

899
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:49.400
<v ->It's a free thing that God gives us.</v>

900
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.515
Free blessings everyday, free miracles.

901
00:45:52.515 --> 00:45:55.437
You don't have to earn this.

902
00:45:55.437 --> 00:45:59.959
There's nothing you can do to earn his love.

903
00:45:59.959 --> 00:46:02.125
<v ->We know that he loves us,</v>

904
00:46:02.125 --> 00:46:04.129
and that he does want the very best for us.

905
00:46:04.129 --> 00:46:07.863
<v ->The public way in which this occurred in my life</v>

906
00:46:07.863 --> 00:46:12.002
was for the purpose of saying to all those around me

907
00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:14.284
I care about you as much as I care about Duane.

908
00:46:14.284 --> 00:46:15.884
I'm just as concerned about your prayers.

909
00:46:15.884 --> 00:46:17.100
They mean something.

910
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.009
So I tell folks today when you pray for somebody,

911
00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:20.300
don't stop praying because you don't know

912
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:25.185
when that moment might be that the change will occur.

913
00:46:25.185 --> 00:46:26.625
Don't give up.

914
00:46:26.625 --> 00:46:27.499
Dont' quit.

915
00:46:27.499 --> 00:46:28.858
It's not over.

916
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.720
(uplifting flute music)
