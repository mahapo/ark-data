>> What if you were a medical
doctor and made a discovery

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
that could help cure millions
of people with inflammatory

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
related diseases, like
acute rheumatism, IBS,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's disease,
asthma, tuberculosis,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:90%
and even some cancers?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And what if, over a
period of 30 years,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
you'd had lots of success
with treating people

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:90%
with this medical discovery?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that it
would be something

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
almost everyone,
especially people who

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
were in charge of keeping
the public healthy,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:90%
would be interested in, right?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:10%
Because, well, aside from
being the proper thing

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:10%
to aim for in a modern
civilized society,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.342 align:middle line:10%
it just makes sense, right?

00:01:08.342 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would stand to reason
that the answer would be yes

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:90%
to all of the above, right?

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

Our story starts in London
with a conversation on a train.

One man is telling another about
an Indian medical doctor who

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
is curing thousands of people
with inflammatory related

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:90%

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
like acute arthritis, allergies,
and even tuberculosis--

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.155 align:middle line:84%
with a different
kind of treatment

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and has been successfully
doing it so far for 30 years.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Yet, he and his methods remain
largely obscure and unknown

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
outside of his home
state of Andhra Pradesh

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%
in southern India.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
The idea was so intriguing that
after a number of conversations

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and emails and Skype calls
between the UK and India,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
we decided to set off to India
in the hope of seeing more

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
After several hours flying
east, we arrived in a city

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
on the southeast coast of
India called Visakhapatnam,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
where we met Dr. Apparao
Peddapalli, the Indian doctor

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
responsible for his
famous inflammation

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:90%
related disease treatments.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Upon arrival at his surgery
in the early afternoon

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.390 align:middle line:84%
on a Saturday, we
saw at least 20

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
to 30 patients queuing
outside and were

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
told that that was the
normal way of things.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Then we were introduced to one
man who just walked six hours

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
from his home in the
countryside to get Dr. Apparao's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:90%
medicine needed by his father.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Southern India has some of the
poorest and largest communities

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world,
with a very low standard

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
of living compared
to Western countries.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And most people
work many more hours

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and earn far less in a month
than even the lowest paid

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.658 align:middle line:84%

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
sobering realities

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is when poor people
fall ill, there

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
is no government medical
insurance to turn to.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So in such circumstances,
it is the family

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
who is looked to when a major
health condition is diagnosed.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
This is probably why
the life expectancy here

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
is 64 years as compared
to 78 in the United States

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and 81 in the United Kingdom.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I have started my career
in the year 1984 as a general

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:10%
practitioner after getting
my basic degree that is MDBS.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:10%
I was in a feeling that
this country like India

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:10%
needs more general
practitioners, not

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:10%
the specialist doctors.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:10%
So with that convention, I went
to my native place, which is

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:10%
called Bobbili, in rural India.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:10%
This is in the
southeast of India,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:10%
and it is rather a
very, very poor place.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:10%
This is the place where
I was started my clinic.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
This is my house.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:90%
That's my clinic.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Although India is considered
one of the fastest growing

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
countries in the
technological age,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
there are still many villages
without both electricity

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
or indoor plumbing, where people
still live and work as they did

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:90%
200 or 300 years ago.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
In some places, it is almost
as if time has stood still.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
In this village here,
the majority of people

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
make their living as farmers or
by chopping and gathering wood

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:90%
from the nearby forests to sell.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So it is ironic that in
this place, where people

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
are so steeped in the traditions
of the past and change

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:84%
comes so slowly,
that a development

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
in medical treatment that
has the potential of changing

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%

was first discovered.

I have got my own house.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:10%
This is 150-year-old small
house that is not even five feet

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:10%
width area, in which I
put some tables and chairs

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:10%
and then started my
practice, that's how.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have any beds.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:10%
I am only a prescribing
doctor doing

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:10%
injections, small,
small treatments,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:10%
attending all the small
needs of the people.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:10%
At deliveries times, I
used to go to their house

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:10%
and do the deliveries like
good olden days practice.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:10%
So gradually my popularity
has risen among the poorest

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:10%
of the poor people.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:10%
So I didn't have any kind
of a conventional fee.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:10%
In those days, the fee was
around 20 rupees or so.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:10%
People used to put one rupee,
half rupee, and two rupees

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:10%
also into my Dabbah.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:10%
And a Dabbah in sense
is called a box.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:10%
This, as people call
it, is a charity box.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:10%
So like that, I had so
much of an acquaintance

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.835 align:middle line:10%
with my patients rather
than not with patients.

00:05:58.835 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:10%
They are my soulmates.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.431 align:middle line:10%
So things are going
very gradually.

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:10%
I have very successful
treating fevers, diarrheas,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:10%
and successful in
conducting deliveries.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:10%
At the time, people used to
pose me a question-- doctor,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:10%
can't you do something
to our joint pains?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.855 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, why not?

00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:10%
When I write ibuprofen or an
aspirin or something like that,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:10%
the failure was at my end.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:10%
So I went into a
deep introspection.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:10%
I thought of, I can't alleviate
these joint pains on a subject,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:10%
I have learnt.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:10%
So I went into
deep introspection

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:10%
and starting pursuing
for various things.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:10%
So at that time,
except the textbook,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:10%
there is no other
area to learn things.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:10%
Now one of the commonest ways
to get the medical information

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:10%
is the medical reps,
medical representatives.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:10%
They used to bring the
information from the company

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:10%
to our doorstep.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:10%
So I got what all
the information we

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:10%
do judiciously, the practice.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:10%
So one fine morning one fellow
introduced a medicine which

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:10%
actually works for allergies.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:10%
So then next time, I'm
having a very rich number

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:10%
of patients, patients that
was not a problem to me.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:10%
So obviously, when I give them
this medicine, their allergy,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:10%
like skin allergy and
an asthmatic wheeze,

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:10%
these things starts coming down.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:10%
So I was happy,
and they are happy.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly one fine
morning, one fellow

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:10%
said, sir, I used to suffer
from so many pains and also

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:10%
the asthmatic wheeze.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:10%
With your medication, I
am happy for my wheeze

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:10%
as I am for my joint pains.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:10%
I am puzzled up.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:10%
The very next moment,
another fellow

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:10%
came with the joint pains.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:10%
He used tons and tons
of so many antibiotics,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:10%
so many painkillers,
and including steroids.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:10%
At the time, his face is
swollen, legs are swollen,

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:10%
and his condition
is so pathetic.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:10%
So since I have the information
that, yeah, that fellow is all

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.525 align:middle line:10%
right, I simply say,
why can't I try this?

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:10%
So I try this medicine.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:10%
This is really
miraculous to work.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:10%
This fellow is happy.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:10%
Within no time, in a
couple of one or two days,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.090 align:middle line:10%
he comes back and
said, doctor, I'm

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:10%
so happy with your medicine.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:10%
So then one by one, joint
pain people used to come,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:10%
and I use it to give
the same kind of regime,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:10%
what I have given
to this fellow.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, my curation
rate is better.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:10%
Then the patients very joyfully
call me the "vata pidigu."

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.845 align:middle line:10%
It says I'm the thunder
to the arthritis.

00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:10%
Of course, it is only a common
name given by the community.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:10%
I was not enjoy
any joy out of it,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:10%
but I am keen in observing
all these things.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:10%
When one fellow is
suffering from joint pains

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:10%
along with his post-paralysis
sequel, he came to me and said,

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:10%
doctor, along with
my joint pains,

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:10%
the paralysis is also better.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:10%
I was confused.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.695 align:middle line:10%


00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:10%
After that, I have
decided that I

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.476 align:middle line:10%
have to understand the
basic science behind it.

00:09:22.476 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:10%
I have given the message
to the very important

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:10%
medical specialists
in this country,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:10%
and they have responded to me.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:10%
After that, I have
realized that I

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:10%
am meddling with some
important portion

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:10%
in the field of immunology.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.245 align:middle line:10%
Immunology is not a
developed science yet.

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And as a rural
doctor, I don't know

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
what is meant by immunology.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:10%
So I've decided to study it.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:10%
For the study, I have sacrificed
my practice, a little practice

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:10%
I started in '84 and left for
the education after a decade.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:10%
So in 1993, I have joined
in MD-microbiology.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:10%
Why I took specifically
microbiology

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:10%
is, microbiology is the science
which contains immunology.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So then offered myself for
another more higher study.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I went to All Indian Institute
for Medical Sciences.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:10%
I could get an opportunity
to do immunology there.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:10%
There I had all
the modern science

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:10%
and conducted my
animal experiments.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:10%
And in this process,
I could come

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:10%
to know all these
days I am arresting is

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:10%
nothing but inflammation.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:10%
So the inflammation is the crux.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:90%
So I was surprised.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I had good success
that I found out

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that the product what I am using
is arresting the inflammation.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:10%
Inflammation is the body's
natural defense process.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:10%
This is like a
cooking fire, which

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:10%
is, as long as it is
useful for us to cook,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:10%
fire is a very good thing.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:10%
And fire suddenly, it flames,
burns the entire house.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:10%
But the fire is fire.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:10%
So the inflammation is
the protecting fire.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:10%
It comes, flares up, arrests
the thing, and protects us.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:10%
This is the game
that nature has given

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:10%
to all the biological species.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:10%
So in the inflammation,
there are so many layers.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:10%
So finally,
inflammation is always

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:10%
interlinked with the
process called healing.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:10%
Inflammation and healing,
they go hand in hand.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:10%
So the inflammation is
due to any reason delayed,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:10%
the healing is delayed.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:10%
And if healing is delayed,
the illness is delayed.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:10%
So at the time, I have
studied further and further

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:10%
and further and further
and further and further.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:10%
One fine morning,
I got the awakening

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:10%
that this IGE mast
cell mediator pathway

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:10%
cycle is inbuilt in
the both of the cycles.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:10%
So that is the crux.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:10%
That histamine cycle, which
is coming as a vicious cycle,

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:10%
is the crux.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:10%
So now the people are
calling this cycle,

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:10%
as on my name,
Rao's Vicious Cycle.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.940 align:middle line:10%
One of the most interesting
case, in the year 1996,

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:10%
I saw some people came
to my clinic I'm running

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:10%
and said, sir, our boy's
in a death condition.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.293 align:middle line:10%
He moved around to
all the hospitals,

00:12:33.293 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:10%
including the
government hospital,

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.756 align:middle line:10%
where they said that the boy
had Japanese B encephalitis.

00:12:39.756 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:10%
So Japanese B encephalitis
is a deadly condition.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:10%
At the time, I had seen
four cases in my notice.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:10%
Three were expired.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.330 align:middle line:10%
And this boy is also
at the time of death.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:10%
They called me, and I
went to their house.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:10%
I went to their village
into the deep houses.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:10%
I said, there is some
new medicine with me

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:10%
I will try with this boy.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:10%
The rest is your luck.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:10%
So I give it, and they
said, the boy, the froth

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:10%
is coming from his mouth.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:09.990 align:middle line:10%
The boy is not blinking.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:10%
He is having a stare look.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:10%
This was the condition.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:10%
I said, OK, if the froth
reduces and the boy

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:10%
is able to blink his eyes,
then give me a message.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:84%
At that time, no
telephones, nothing.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Only bicycles.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:10%
They came in the
night around 8 o'clock

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:10%
and said the boy is
blinking his eyes.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to bring
the boy to my house.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:10%
I own a house.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:10%
So we put the boy on my long
table, and he's in deep coma.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:10%
He's not responding even
to the pain stimuli.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:10%
At that time, we had started
the drips and other things just

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.263 align:middle line:10%
to maintain the vitals.

00:13:53.263 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:10%
And gradually, I
give him a couple

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:10%
of doses of this molecule.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:10%
He was in coma
for about 21 days.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:10%


00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:10%
So one fine morning, the boy
could get out from a deep sleep

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:10%
and sat up.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:10%
This is a surprise to me.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.240 align:middle line:10%
Before that, once or
twice, they were asking me

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:10%
that if the boy's
going to survive.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:10%
I said, I don't know.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:10%
If the boy survives, what
would be your expectations

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:10%
to happen with the boy?

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:10%
I said, usually,
encephalitis means

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:10%
we lose all the vital
functions of the brain.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:10%
But all to my surprise, he
has lost only two fingers,

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:10%
and he regained
his consciousness.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:10%
He is talking and has
grown up to this age.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Now he has become the
father of two children.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:17:08.123 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:08.123 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What is equally
as interesting as Dr.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Apparao's cases is the fact
that his work is endorsed

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and supported by his
medical colleagues,

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
all of whom have been trained
in Western biomedicine.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> This could be a breakthrough.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Probably he'll
have to experiment

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
this so-called treatment by Dr.
Apparao in many, many patients,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and he has to put this theory
across so many medical forums.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
He has to get something
like acceptance

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
from all these
forums because he's

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.897 align:middle line:84%
going to deal with
many number of patients

00:17:45.897 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:84%
across all inflammatory
diseases, cancer diseases,

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:84%
across all inflammatory
disease, in cancer disease,

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:90%
in diabetes also.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So in that aspect,
this treatment's

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be very, very
helpful to so many people.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:84%
But still, as I said,
it needs acceptance

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:90%
from all medical forums.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In conventional medicine,
majority of diseases are dealt

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
independently, and there's no
common initial point in any

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of the conventional approach.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But in the Vicious
Cycle, as Dr. Rao stated,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
initially all these have
the same start-up process.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to stop the
initial process, all of these

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:90%
can stop.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So no one in
conventional medicine

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:84%
talks about the initial
results in all of the diseases.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I have seen many
cancer patients dealt

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Rao who are
advised to have chemotherapy

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:90%
and radiotherapy.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Any patient who wants to go to
chemotherapy or radiotherapy

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
will definitely end up
having some complications.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And even though the absolute
lifespan is increased,

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
it's not increased
because of the side

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.565 align:middle line:84%
effects that will come
because of chemotherapy

00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%
and radiotherapy.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:04.342 align:middle line:84%
But if the patients are ready
for the therapy of Dr. Rao,

00:19:04.342 --> 00:19:05.425 align:middle line:90%
the outcome is miraculous.

00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I have seen some breast
cancer patients, liver cancer

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
patients, and pancreatic cancer
patients who has been treated

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
by Rao for a couple of years.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
are out of the disease,

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and there are no side effects
with this medication treatment.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:10%
>> It doesn't have
any side effects.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:10%
Only one or two minimal side
effects we have encountered.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.947 align:middle line:10%
Literally, it doesn't
have any side effects.

00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:10%
And that's the reason why we
are giving very comfortably

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:10%
in each and every place.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:90%
We can give it in a clinic.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
We are giving it in
the railway station.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:84%
They want to get it in the
bus terminal, on the roadside.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:10%
Nothing happens because it
is available to the people

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:10%
because they cannot come here
so much of far off places.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:10%
There is a lot of financial
constraint for the patients.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:10%
If I'm on the way, I'm
comfortable in delivering

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.707 align:middle line:10%
these goods to them.

00:19:54.707 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:10%
This is an
inexpensive treatment.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:10%
Generally, most of
the patients can

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:10%
feel better and cured
for an amount in rupees

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:10%
equal to about 100
American dollars, which

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:10%
is equal to 70 British pounds.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:10%
So this is sufficient
to manage this show.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:10%
The people are
successful with this.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:10%
So then we may
extend the course,

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:10%
for which the funding for
them is very comfortable.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:10%
This works about for about
a three-month period.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:10%
So in three months, we'll ask
them to put in some money,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:10%
even in installments.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:10%
We don't take at the time.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:10%
We will ask them
to keep that money.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:10%
We will ask them to expense
for themselves periodically.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:10%
That's all.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:10%
>> So based upon this, I think
this treatment can be easily

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:10%
introduced to any country.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Shouldn't we, as a society,
be concerned about curing

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:10%
illnesses and taking a serious
look at what is being talked

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:10%
about and offered, especially
as it may provide answers

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:10%
to the acknowledged and growing
economic problems in health

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:10%

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:10%
>> In the current situation,
the big driver is economics

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:10%
because with rising health
care costs, aging population,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:10%
and rising lifestyle illnesses,
we are not going to be able

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:10%
to afford to give the kind
of medicine we're giving now

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:10%
to every person.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:10%
So I believe in five
years time if one of us

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:10%
suddenly got chest pain,
ringing for an ambulance,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:10%
we might not actually
be lucky enough

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:10%
to have a blue light ambulance
here in 15 or 20 minutes.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:10%
And so already, big
pharma is suffering

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:10%
because they can't be
guaranteed that anybody

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:10%
will buy the drugs
that are being created,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:10%
the new drugs being created.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:10%
Previously, if a company
invested $50 million

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:10%
in bringing a drug
to market, they

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:10%
could be pretty confident
that the NHS would pay for it.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:10%
Now that is not clear at all.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:10%
And I've even seen a very
cynical little insurance

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:10%
policy called My
Cancer Drugs, where

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:22.810 align:middle line:10%
people are being persuaded to
invest now in a premium in case

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:10%
they have cancer and in case the
NHS can't pay for their drugs.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:10%
So I think that
cost effectiveness

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:10%
is going to be the key.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:10%
And I think that the holistic
health movement, the more we

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:10%
can prove that simple,
cheap, effective lifestyle

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:10%
interventions are cutting costs,
the more traction we'll get.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So now we know about this
possible medical discovery that

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
seems to have been working for
the good of patients for 30

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And not only is
it affordable, it

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:84%
can be administered without
fear of side effects.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:10%
The next logical step would be
to popularize this discovery,

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:10%
announce it to the world, put
it into the hands of doctors

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:10%
and let people come
running to get cured.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is logical, right?

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:10%
All the health care
officials, especially

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:10%
those connected to
governments whose job it

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:10%
is to make sure the public
stays healthy as possible,

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:10%
will surely respond
positively, right?

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, not really.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the way in
which new medical treatments

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.800 align:middle line:84%
are discovered, managed,
and brought to market

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
is part of the
pharmaceutical business that

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.460 align:middle line:84%
has very little to do
with curing people,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
but rather more to do
with creating huge profits

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:90%
for its investors.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So now the issue becomes,
can we or should we

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:84%
trust an industry that has
shown itself to be consistently

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:84%
corrupt to help deliver
something that may actually

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
stop people spending
lots and lots of money

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:90%
buying their medicines?

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So now we have Dr. Apparao with
his novel approach to healing.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:84%
How likely would it be for him
to enter into the established

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.605 align:middle line:90%
marketplace?

00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:15.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, it'd be impossible.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely impossible.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:10%
The business of licensing a
drug requires vast resources,

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.540 align:middle line:10%
and it'd be quite impossible
for me, as an individual,

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:10%
to do that.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:10%
So that's out of the question.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.142 align:middle line:10%
The drug companies aren't
interested in curing people.

00:24:32.142 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the last thing the
drug companies want to do

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:10%
is to cure people.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:10%
What drug companies
want is people

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:10%
taking symptom suppression
medication for life,

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:10%
or at least the long-term.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:10%
And if that causes other
problems requiring more drugs,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:10%
well, that's even better because
that's what's good for profits.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:10%
So drug companies do not want
to cure in the short term.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't make
any money at all.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:10%

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>> New drugs that are brought
to market are done so at huge

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
expense by a group of large
pharmaceutical companies

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
collectively and commonly
referred to as "big pharma."

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:10%
They control the flow of what
drugs come onto the marketplace

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:10%
by using their huge financial
and political influence.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This can include the financing
of the research and testing

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of the drugs they sell, lobbying
various governmental bodies

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:84%
to approve their drugs
for sale, financing

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
the education of
doctors involved

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
in the dispensing
of their drugs,

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:84%
marketing to get the
public to buy their drugs.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:84%
All of this is no secret
because, for many years now,

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
lots of experts have been
saying the same thing.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Marcia Angell,
former editor-in-chief

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:10%
at the "New England Journal of
Medicine" noted in a lecture

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:10%
that "drug companies pay for
most continuing education,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:10%
which doctors have to get
in order to keep their state

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.755 align:middle line:10%
licenses" and that
the reason for this

00:26:26.755 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:10%
is simply because "doctors
write the prescriptions

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.730 align:middle line:10%
that prescription drugs
require in order to be sold."

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been in NHS general
practice for 20 years.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:10%
And it's been increasingly
apparent to me

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:10%
that the doctors within
the National Health

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:10%
Service, and indeed within
conventional medicine,

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:10%
are not addressing the
root causes of disease.

>> So knowing all of this, where
does that leave Dr. Apparao,

00:26:56.145 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
who might have discovered
something that could help

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish the job of
really curing certain diseases?

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
where does that

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
leave those patients
with illnesses

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:90%
in need of a real cure?

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Under the current system,
quite simply, out of luck.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime, big pharma
is still making billions,

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.200 align:middle line:84%
while Dr. Apparao
operates completely

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
at the other end of
the financial spectrum.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:10%

earning, is my salary.

So whatever the money that
we are incurring on this,

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:10%
this is sufficient
to maintain our show.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Meanwhile, as we tried to
think of a possible solution

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:10%
and not allow ourselves to
become depressed by this David

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.870 align:middle line:10%
versus Goliath scenario,
let's turn to one of the most

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:10%
interesting of Dr. Apparao's
cases that involved a woman

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:10%
farmer.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:10%
>> In my area, the cigars, the
cigar smoking in the reverse is

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:10%
a common phenomenon.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:10%
Here, the people,
especially women,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:10%
also smoke because
it's a very rural area.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:10%
So that's called
reverse smoking, which

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:10%
causes so much of
heat inside the mouth,

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:10%
and it damages the palate.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:10%
But gradually, because of
the chronic irritation,

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:10%
they will get
cancer hard palate.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.190 align:middle line:10%
So this grows in a
small ulcer, then

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:10%
it perforates, comes
to cauliflower stage,

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:10%
and finally, it takes a fellow.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%

cigar into the mouth.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:10%
This may look like
a stage trick,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:10%
but let me assure you it is not.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
It is simply a common

>> One lady called Bagarama,
Miss Bagarama has come to me

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:10%
on fine afternoon with already
a major phase of cauliflower.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:10%
She said that she went
to cancer hospitals,

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.830 align:middle line:10%
and they said that
they wanted to do

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:10%
radiation and other things.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:10%
Since she was so much
worried about the radiation,

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:10%
she don't want to
undergo all those things.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.720 align:middle line:10%
And while the
medicines previously

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.990 align:middle line:10%
were given were useless
to her, she said,

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:10%
you use something which
may be useful at least

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:10%
to relieve my pain.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:10%
So that by the time
that she come to me,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:10%
the worse thing is her pain.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.150 align:middle line:10%
Because I already am master
to reduce the pain, since I'm

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:10%
already used to reducing
the pains of all arthritis

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:10%
people, the same ways she might
have given in a good interest

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:10%
to relieve her pain.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.700 align:middle line:10%
So she is comfortable
for one week,

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:10%
not only comfortable, the
irritation has come down.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:10%
After that, gradually,
everything has come down.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.370 align:middle line:10%
So after two months of so, there
is no cauliflower structure.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:10%
That is healed.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:10%
Then they took Bagarama
to a cancer surgeon

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.990 align:middle line:10%
and presented this case to him.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:10%
He is a renowned cancer
surgeon in our area.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:10%
Once in a while, he visits
from the US to India.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:10%
He is a pioneer in making
cancer hospital in this place.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:10%
He has examined and said
with a very exciting mood

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.570 align:middle line:10%
and told to me,
Rao has got cure!

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.810 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly I know what
the meaning of healing.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:10%
So I was amazed.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:10%
This Bagarama woman is alive
somewhere around 15 years.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:10%
For the 15 years, the
cancer has not relapsed.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:10%
She is here and healthy.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:10%
She is doing a
lot of activities.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.570 align:middle line:84%
She came in as a middle-aged
woman, now she is an old woman.

has formed support groups that

I treat are also being treated

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Apparao.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.464 align:middle line:84%
I will send my worst
cases to Dr. Apparao

00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:13.639 align:middle line:84%
where I could not get sufficient
satisfactory treatment.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I will send them,
they got cured.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
What he's doing is the
scientific approach.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.740 align:middle line:84%
His medicine is
based on science.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.642 align:middle line:90%
It is not speculation.

00:34:23.642 --> 00:34:29.216 align:middle line:84%
His medicine is entirely
scientific medicine.

00:34:29.216 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:84%
The theory, the evaluation
according to premise he says

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:84%
is different, but I feel he
is scientifically treating.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:90%

I have the passion
towards healing.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:47.045 align:middle line:10%
I'm simply a medical man.

00:34:47.045 --> 00:34:49.460 align:middle line:10%
I have a belief in my concept.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.305 align:middle line:10%
At the same time, it is working.

00:34:51.305 --> 00:34:54.409 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
all this is happening.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
We conduct small,
small gatherings

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.720 align:middle line:90%
at least once in two months.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.076 align:middle line:84%
And at least once in six months,
we will have a big gathering.

00:35:04.076 --> 00:35:07.401 align:middle line:84%
This gives us so much
of moral support.

00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:10%
We are getting a lot of
feedback-- how much dose we

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:10%
can fix, what are the dicey
areas, the things we are not

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:10%
supposed to do, what
to stop, what to take.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:24.080 align:middle line:10%
These things can get very
freely out of these feedbacks.

>> I myself suffered
a lot two years back.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I had
severe joint pains,

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.155 align:middle line:84%
and there was swelling
in all the joints.

00:35:33.155 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was suffering a lot, and
I had all types of medicine,

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:90%
including homeopathic, Ayurveda.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.985 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen one or
two rheumatologists also.

00:35:43.985 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They said this is a
seronegative arthritis,

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and you need to get treatment
for a very long time.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:90%
We can choose steroids also.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I was not getting
relief with any of the drugs.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So one fine day,
one of my colleagues

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.927 align:middle line:90%
suggested to see Dr. Apparao.

00:36:01.927 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I could not even walk
for a few days because

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.550 align:middle line:90%
of the joint pains and all.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I could not even get up
and go to the bathroom.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:90%
So in that state, I went to him.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I have
a drug which will

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:84%
cut short the inflammation
process at the beginning stage

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.400 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, the only
thing is you have

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.192 align:middle line:90%
to take three or four shots.

00:36:29.192 --> 00:36:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And depending on that,
we'll go ahead, he said.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.426 align:middle line:84%
So I took a chance, and
he gave me the first shot.

00:36:36.426 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:84%
The very next day, almost 80% to
90% of my pains have subsided.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:90%
I was so impressed.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So I had to take almost six
injections after about one

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:90%
week.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Then I started thinking
a regular dose of one

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.887 align:middle line:90%
to two months.

00:36:53.887 --> 00:36:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Later, I stopped because
I was unable to meet him.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.428 align:middle line:84%
And when I come,
he's out of state.

00:36:57.428 --> 00:36:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And when he's in,
I'm out of state

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:84%
because I work 200
kilometers from here.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So that way, I was very
much impressed with him.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So I feel it'll help many of
the patients who are suffering

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:84%
from arthritis or severe
arthritis or any joint pains

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:84%
or any inflammatory
disease for that matter

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.700 align:middle line:84%
because he's cutting at the
root of preliminary stages

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.820 align:middle line:90%
of inflammatory process.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> One cannot help
but think that Dr.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:10%
Apparao's discovery might
have acquired more widespread

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.390 align:middle line:10%
interest if instead of being an
Indian doctor working in poor

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:10%
southern Indian communities,
he was associated with

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:10%
a prestigious Western medical
establishment or research

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:10%
institution.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Which then leads to the
question, why have we,

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:84%
as a society, come to doubt
when an individual rather

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.880 align:middle line:84%
than a known company makes
a groundbreaking discovery?

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Is it because we're so blinded
by the marketing and sales

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:84%
efforts of an established
and self-serving industry

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have become
tricked into plotting

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.120 align:middle line:90%
against our own best interests?

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.990 align:middle line:10%
Have we become so influenced
by one avenue of discovery

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:10%
that we rule out others just
because the discoverers don't

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:10%
look the way we've been
told they should look?

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Or is it because the
world of Dr. Apparao

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.820 align:middle line:84%
is a place where
certain things are still

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.810 align:middle line:84%
done in ways that would astound
Western values, sensibilities,

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and expectations?

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:10%
So this is going
to be evaluated,

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:10%
and this is the credit given
by the community to me.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.450 align:middle line:10%
Resistance is common.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.060 align:middle line:10%
I am not bothered about that.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:10%
Here's what my destiny is.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:10%
I am giving my 30 years
of clinical experience

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.650 align:middle line:10%
for validation and discussion.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:17.742 align:middle line:10%
This is my sheer observations
over a long period of 30 years.

00:40:17.742 --> 00:40:19.656 align:middle line:10%
I am a doctor.

00:40:19.656 --> 00:40:23.410 align:middle line:10%
I am just treating with
the available medicines.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:26.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm not making and
synthesizing medicines.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm not dispensing
in any different way.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:10%
So the thing is that I could
use them more properly, more

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.240 align:middle line:10%
traditionally, with
more reason and logic.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.830 align:middle line:10%
The key is very simple.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:10%
The key is very simple.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.330 align:middle line:10%
This may be
unlocking more locks.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Systems don't like change.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.540 align:middle line:10%
And the reason we call
things an establishment

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:10%
is because it's established.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.750 align:middle line:10%
It's settled.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:53.920 align:middle line:10%
It's solid.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes solidity
can mean rigidity as well.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:10%
So it's very hard to
create change quickly

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.170 align:middle line:10%
in any large and
established system.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's true about
medicine the way

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.340 align:middle line:10%
it is about anything else.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:10%
If you come up with
a new idea and you

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:10%
begin to produce
positive results,

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:10%
if it can't be explained
in the old language,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:10%
people are going to
be suspicious of it

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.240 align:middle line:10%
because they have a lot
invested in that old system.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.630 align:middle line:10%
Producing change suddenly means
giving up that investment,

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.210 align:middle line:10%
saying, oh my goodness,
we were wrong.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:10%
There are some classic
examples of this

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.380 align:middle line:10%
in the history of medicine.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:40.990 align:middle line:10%
A doctor named Semmelweis
discovered that it was probably

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:10%
other doctors who
were carrying germs

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:10%
from one pregnant
woman to another

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:10%
and making infections
that caused

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.545 align:middle line:10%
the women or their
babies to die.

00:41:51.545 --> 00:41:53.295 align:middle line:10%
Now doctors did not
want to hear this.

00:41:53.295 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:10%
They didn't want to hear
it before he had evidence,

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.460 align:middle line:10%
and they really didn't
want to hear it afterwards.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.510 align:middle line:10%
And so change didn't
happen right away.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.430 align:middle line:10%
That process is repeated
hundreds and hundreds of times.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's not a case
of a conspiracy.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:10%
It's the case of a
lot of people who

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.760 align:middle line:10%
have dedicated their lives
to doing the best they can

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:10%
under a particular model
being a little reluctant

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.182 align:middle line:10%
to suddenly get told,
hey, you were wrong,

00:42:19.182 --> 00:42:20.890 align:middle line:10%
you've been doing it
wrong all this time,

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.990 align:middle line:10%
your patients have
had ongoing pain

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.120 align:middle line:10%
because you didn't do it right.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.390 align:middle line:10%
People feel anxious
and they feel guilty

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.760 align:middle line:10%
and they feel
suspicious when they

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:10%
get told that they were
wrong all this time

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:36.890 align:middle line:10%
and that everything they
were taught was wrong, too.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:10%
But of course, you also have
very particular standards

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:10%
in the field of medicine.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.420 align:middle line:10%
Today, we expect
certain kinds of proof.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.260 align:middle line:10%
And one doctor and
that doctor's patients

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:10%
may not be able to produce
enough evidence that it can

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:10%
overturn an established theory.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.140 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's part of
the problem we have here.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:10%
Most doctors are
running to stay in place

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:10%
in terms of medical change.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:10%
Just keeping up with the
field is incredibly difficult.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.350 align:middle line:10%
Keeping up with the
field and innovating

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.680 align:middle line:10%
and bringing on board things
that haven't been accepted by,

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:10%
let's say, insurance companies
or your hospital board

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.860 align:middle line:10%
of ethics, that's
virtually impossible

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:10%
for any single doctor to do.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not saying that
Dr. Apparao's discovery is

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
the panacea for
all our illnesses,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:90%
but then neither is he.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But what he is
saying, however, is

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.780 align:middle line:84%
he has come upon something that
offers a different perspective

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.880 align:middle line:84%
about inflammatory
illnesses that

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:43.050 align:middle line:84%
affect a large
section of our society

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and that his treatment
of these illnesses based

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.910 align:middle line:84%
on his theory developed
over a 30-year period

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.970 align:middle line:84%
has given him a success
rate and enough credibility

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:55.900 align:middle line:84%
to merit the attention of
impartial medical researchers

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.750 align:middle line:84%
who are not under the
direct or indirect influence

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.910 align:middle line:84%
of vested pharmaceutical
company interests.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And the best part of
it is that Dr. Apparao

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.470 align:middle line:84%
seems anxious to share
what he has learned

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:84%
with any reputable
research institution that

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:90%
may be interested in his work.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:19.090 align:middle line:84%
We can also look at the argument
from another perspective.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:23.260 align:middle line:84%
In an aging society with
mounting health care costs,

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.390 align:middle line:84%
can we afford not
to look seriously

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:28.750 align:middle line:84%
at something that may
cure serious illnesses

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:84%
in an economical
way, that may offer

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.605 align:middle line:84%
long-term economic
and health benefits?

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:37.030 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:10%
>> I might have treated more
than 3,000 arthritis patients,

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:57.050 align:middle line:10%
more than some 300
paralysis patients.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.970 align:middle line:10%
And I might have treated
more than 40 cancer patients.

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:10%
The only inclusion
criteria is that there

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.190 align:middle line:10%
must be an inflammation
and which is not responding

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.290 align:middle line:10%
to the regular treatments.

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.420 align:middle line:10%
That is my category.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:10%
But my success rate
is more than 60%.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.210 align:middle line:10%
It is not the drug.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.620 align:middle line:10%
It is not just
give a single shot.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I have not encountered the
single shot cures much.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.390 align:middle line:10%
We may get one or two,
but single shot cures

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:10%
are very less.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.030 align:middle line:10%
It must be consistent.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.160 align:middle line:10%
We have some regime.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.380 align:middle line:10%
That regime has
to be maintained.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.470 align:middle line:10%
In science, all
these days we are

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.055 align:middle line:10%
thinking that diseases
is very divergent.

00:45:43.055 --> 00:45:48.900 align:middle line:10%
I probably am the first man who
might have found or observed

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:10%
or summed up over
a period of time

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:10%
that all the diseases
have an interlink.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.900 align:middle line:10%
This interlink is
nothing but histamine

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.240 align:middle line:10%
and its vicious cycle, what
I call Rao's Vicious Cycle.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:10%
This is reverse engineering.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.320 align:middle line:10%
Unknowingly, we have
cured so many patients.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:10%
After analyzing them, we are
looking at only one area.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.340 align:middle line:10%
So this area is an interlink.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.880 align:middle line:10%
And after thoroughly,
thoroughly,

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.210 align:middle line:10%
thoroughly having the
largest study on it

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.160 align:middle line:10%
over a period of more than
one and a half decades,

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:35.370 align:middle line:10%
we have found out some principle
that is the basic principle.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:40.020 align:middle line:10%
Probably it is going
to be a very important

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.170 align:middle line:10%
biological principle.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:48.260 align:middle line:10%
If it is being, what is it
called, thoroughly studied

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:52.760 align:middle line:10%
by the institutions, if
it gets the limelight,

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:58.370 align:middle line:10%
suddenly we may be
getting an important clue

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:10%
in curing a huge
number of diseases.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:10%
What many people
don't realize is

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:08.070 align:middle line:10%
that the pharmaceutical
business and medical research

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:09.980 align:middle line:10%
are two different things.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.900 align:middle line:10%
The pharmaceutical business
wants to make money,

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.160 align:middle line:10%
but the medical research
wants to cure diseases.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>> But what can we do as
individuals to even out these

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:10%
odds against the Goliath-like
behemoth system that

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.710 align:middle line:10%
discourages new avenues
of discovery in medicine?

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:32.790 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, we can use
the power of social media

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and contact everyone we know who
might find this program useful

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and urge them to contact
Dr. Apparao directly

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.670 align:middle line:90%
via his website.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:45.090 align:middle line:10%
Or they can contact their
political representatives

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:10%
or even their local
health authorities

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:10%
to investigate
further into the help

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.140 align:middle line:10%
that Dr. Apparao is
offering to sufferers

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:10%
of inflammatory diseases.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.420 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:00.510 align:middle line:10%
>> In my experience, I have
seen all of these patients--

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.900 align:middle line:10%
patients with cancer, patients
with cirrhosis of liver,

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.240 align:middle line:10%
patients with severe
bit of arthritis.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:10%
These have all came,
and they're all

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.240 align:middle line:10%
recovered, still recovering.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.400 align:middle line:10%
So many success
studies are there.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.780 align:middle line:10%
So what I wanted
to say is that this

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:23.430 align:middle line:10%
should be a kind
of an alternative,

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:28.590 align:middle line:10%
a holistic approach to
the very, very big problem

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:30.990 align:middle line:10%
of anti-human health.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:34.975 align:middle line:10%

Rao's Vicious Cycle works.
