you are at the deepest level.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>We think of the heart in the
poetic sense, the seat of love

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:10%

But the heart is more than that.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:10%
>>We did an experiment
here at HeartMath

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:10%
to study how the
information flows

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:10%
between the heart and the
brain, and we actually

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:10%
discovered something
quite remarkable,

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:10%
something that surprised us.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
The participants
in the study were

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
connected to various sensors
to measure their brain waves,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:90%
their heartbeats, and so on.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
exposed to various images.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Some were high arousal,
like a car crash,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
or a snake striking,
while others

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
were lower arousal images
like bunny rabbits and nature

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:90%
scenes.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
The participants were
asked to push a button.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:84%
They then saw a blank computer
screen for six seconds.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The computer then
randomly selected

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:84%
one of these photographs that
it displayed for three seconds.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
After that the screen
went blank for 10 seconds,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and they were prompted
to push the button again,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and they repeated this
protocol about 30 times.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
When we analyzed all the data,
the results were astounding.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The heart seemed
to know the images

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.555 align:middle line:84%
before the participants ever
saw the images with their eyes.

00:06:37.555 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
If the future picture was going
to be one of the emotionally

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
arousing ones, the
heart rate started

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
to drop about five seconds
before the image was randomly

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
selected to be
shown on the screen.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So nobody could know what this
future picture was going to be.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
The heart had a much
greater de-acceleration

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.367 align:middle line:84%
than if it was, say, going
to be a calm picture.

00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
These results have
since been replicated

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
in many different independent
labs around the world,

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.982 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people say that
I don't feel it in my heart,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I feel it in my gut.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But here's what's
really happening.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%
The information comes
to the heart first.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
The heart then sends
a different signal

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
to the brain which
we can measure.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a brain response,
and then a body response.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And with the body
response, like feeling

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
in the gut, or the hair
on the back of the neck,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:90%
is where it becomes conscious.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But the real flow of information
is heart, brain, body.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
happening in many seconds

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:90%
before the actual event occurs.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So what this body of
research is telling

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
us is that the heart
seems to be connected

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
to a type of intuition that is
not bound by the limits of time

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.740 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But what is that
source of intuition?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
What is the heart connected
to, and how can we

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:90%
learn to tap into more of that?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.614 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.614 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe that
the person who is

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from his or
her heart is not living.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people who
[? felt ?] that but they

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
walk, they talk, they
watch television,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:90%
they work hard sometimes.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:10%
>>We're the only
living form on Earth

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:10%
that can actually
become the walking dead.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
We can actually cut off our
own source to aliveness.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>But somehow this spark
of divine energy is lost.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:90%
This happened to me.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I want
to be a writer.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:90%
My band says, oh come on, Paulo.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
In Brazil, to be a
writer in Brazil,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
nobody can make a
living out of writing.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, but I don't care,
I just want to be happy.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I just want to do something
that is going to give me fun.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It's going to give a
meaning for my life.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
because I thought

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
that old people are wiser, I
said, OK, they have reason.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Let me do something different.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.460 align:middle line:90%
But I could not.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I quit the university to I was
only [INAUDIBLE] and I said,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:90%
you have to burn your bridges.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:90%
And I just burned my bridges.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.085 align:middle line:84%
And I had no choice
but to follow the thing

00:09:43.085 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to do.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So from the moment
that I realized

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
that I want to be a writer, I
said, I'm going to be a writer.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It may take 10 days,
10 years, or 20 years,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to write.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I started by
writing lyrics for songs,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I start by writing
articles for newspapers.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.496 align:middle line:84%
I wrote my first
book when I was 40,

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:12.844 align:middle line:84%
but at least I
wrote my first book.

00:10:12.844 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So at the end, if you
don't fulfill your dream,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:84%
God finds three, four times
a way to kick your head

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and say, come on.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget your
purpose in your life.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Give a chance to your dream.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.165 align:middle line:90%
You are not going to regret.

00:10:36.165 --> 00:10:38.123 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that you're
not going to suffer.

00:10:38.123 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that you're
not going to be defeated.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying you're not
going to go regret it.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:10%
>>The medieval female
mystic, Mechthild,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:10%
beautifully said that a
fish cannot drown in water

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:10%
and a bird cannot
fall from the sky.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Each creature must find
their own God-given element.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy for fish and
birds, they know their element.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But for human beings
it's not so easy.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
With well intention,
we always struggle

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:84%
whether to follow our heart
and our direct experience

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and the advice and
instruction of others.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Whether they be parents,
loved ones, friends, trends

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:90%
in whatever age we're born into.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's no substitute
for following the aliveness

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:90%
that our heart tunes us to.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.214 align:middle line:84%
>>Many times people are looking
for their ideal partner,

00:11:48.214 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and they say they
can't find them.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:10%
They're looking, and they're
looking, and they're looking,

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:10%
and they can't find them.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:10%
Well if your soulmate is
not knocking on your door,

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:10%
it's not that you're
not looking hard enough.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
If you want to find
someone that can fully

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
love you and know you, you
have to know and love yourself.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
When we're able to give
ourself this kind of love which

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:84%
says we're good
enough just the way

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
we are, that we're in
this world for a reason,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that we're never alone,
that sense of fulfillment

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
provides a foundation for
having a successful relationship

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:90%
with someone else.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>A great teacher this
is a simple flower.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
When the flower
blossoms, the bee comes.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The flower doesn't go
looking for the bee.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
heart really comes alive,

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
because relationships are far
more challenging than what

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:90%
we see in the movies.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>All right, roll it.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.168 align:middle line:90%
>>I've loved you all my life.

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>But we only met two days ago.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>That's when my life began.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>The journey of
a relationship is

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
finding love every time
again, and again, and again.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And to find love
again and again means

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lose it,
and lose it, and lose it.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Often the question arises that
if the heart is so powerful,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:90%
why is it so easily broken?

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And my time on Earth has
led me to understand,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
the heart grows.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that when we
exercise our muscles actually

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:84%
break down so that they can
get healthy and grow stronger,

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%
this is how the heart works.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>You have to bring
forth obstacles,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's what a marriage is.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:90%
You will be challenged.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>One day a blonde walked
into Charles' life.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.703 align:middle line:90%
>>Was she really pretty?

00:13:38.703 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I'd lie about her,
but Marian saw her, too.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, she's very pretty.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>There'll be times when
you doubt your partner,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:84%
you doubt your relationship, and
you're angry with your partner.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>There isn't the slightest
bit of good in you.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>You're afraid to get
close to your partner,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:84%
you've been hurt
by your partner.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>He's hiding something
from me, Sylvie.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Something terrible.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>This is part of that journey.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, in the moment of
such breaking, it's agony,

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and we feel desperate.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But the heart, the heart
just says, give me more.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Give me more.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>As you come back to love,
each time coming back to love,

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.070 align:middle line:84%
finding forgiveness,
finding acceptance, even

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
thanking your partner at
times for their inadequacies

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, because
it poured forth

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
greater love within yourself,
that is how you grow.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>There was a battle, all right.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't Paul I had
to fight, but myself.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Bonnie will say
to me, John, I don't

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
want to listen to
you until you're

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:90%
talking to me from your heart.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I'm talking,
I'm making sense.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear your feeling.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear your love
in the tone of your voice.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you can find
it, we can talk again.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
What a simple
message she gives me.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, it would be
a mistake for her

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:84%
to say something's wrong
with being in my head,

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:84%
because that would make a very
important part of me wrong.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But what she'll say
is at times what

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
my heart is closed,
when I sound mean

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.766 align:middle line:90%
or focused on being right--

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, if you want to tell me
what's troubling you, fine.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
If not, I'm tired, it's late,
and I want to go home to bed.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>She'll say, right
now, I can't hear this.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I need to hear a little
bit more of your heart.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready to
talk from your heart,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to talk with you.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the
challenge in our age

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:90%
is staying in a relationship.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean to
stay in abusive relationships

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
or relationships
that don't work.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have found for
me that the difference

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:84%
often as to whether to stay or
go in a friendship or a love

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:45.115 align:middle line:84%
relationship hinges on whether
all of who I am is welcome.

00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
If I am asked to leave who I
am or part of who I am outside,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
then no matter what we
do in that relationship,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.330 align:middle line:90%
I won't grow.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I won't be able to
stay connected to my heart.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>And this is where their
story really begins.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be fair to tell you
how it ends, for that, we hope,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.474 align:middle line:84%
is something you'll want
to experience for yourself.

00:16:13.474 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Things can get crazy, no?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:10%
So many people,
they lose their kids

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:10%
because there is
no relationship,

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:10%
there is no contact.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Which is very bad, because
no time to try again,

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and to try again,
to find a solution.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I have four kids.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:10%
One of them is playing
for [? IX. ?] Probably

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:10%
I paid more attention to that.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:10%
And then the oldest one got
a little bit less attention,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, and he
was against me in a way.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And I decided, I
have to do something.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I have to give him an
opportunity to get closer.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.154 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
I told him, come on.

00:17:06.154 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
We take the bags and we'll
go to Greece, you know?

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, in order to persuade
him, it might be my last time.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Why did you say that?

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.264 align:middle line:84%
>>When we go up on the
Alps I will tell you.

00:17:19.264 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>I had nothing to tell him.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I just told him because
otherwise he wouldn't come,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that
he wouldn't come.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.175 align:middle line:84%
We went from Amsterdam,
to Athens, Greece.

00:17:28.175 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
You become his brother,
you become his mate,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:90%
you become his friend.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:84%
This would happen up in the
Alps, where it was minus 16

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.634 align:middle line:84%
and we're freezing
cold, so we became one.

00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:49.582 align:middle line:90%
>>Hey, where are you, man?

00:17:49.582 --> 00:17:50.753 align:middle line:90%
>>Dad, where are you?

00:17:50.753 --> 00:17:52.345 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a little
house here, come!

00:17:52.345 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello?

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Hey!

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Look at this, please, please
let us sleep with you tonight.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
If you allow me to sleep
here tonight, me and Willem,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:90%
just for a night.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.632 align:middle line:90%
It's so cold.

00:18:08.632 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>And then everything went
away all this friction

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:84%
because I was in the
same team with him.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And I love that, and I'm very
happy that this little mistake

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of mine, which
was not dedicating

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:90%
enough time to my oldest son--

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.656 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know
nothing about boxing,

00:18:26.656 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:90%
so be careful with your dad, eh?

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>And now that we are
really, really good friends.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Every father has good
friction with his son.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And love it.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
You have good kids, no?

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I hope you will enjoy when
the friction is coming.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.406 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise he hasn't
got any character.

00:18:46.406 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>You OK?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, man.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.713 align:middle line:84%
>>So when your son is
against you, be very happy.

00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:52.513 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:52.513 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:10%
>>On Sunday, September 22nd,
at about 10:54 in the evening,

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:10%
our daughter was riding her
bicycle home from the CSU Chico

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:10%
State Library when she was
struck by a drunk driver

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:10%
and left on the side
of the road to die.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>In the phone conversation
with the nurse,

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
we knew that she had
been in an accident,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't know
any of the details.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
That it was a drunk driver, and
that it was a 19-year-old kid.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:84%
She was riding four
blocks home from school.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
She was about a half a
block from her apartment.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>You could see her apartment
from where she was hit.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>You could actually
stand on the bridge

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and see her
apartment from there.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>She was so close.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.536 align:middle line:84%
>>That's how close it was, and
I've stood there so many times

00:19:48.536 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and just looked
at that distance.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Just thought about that short
distance has changed our lives.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Christina was one of
those extraordinary people

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.260 align:middle line:84%
that you don't come
across very often.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.554 align:middle line:90%
>>She studied.

00:20:11.554 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
She really thought about
how to live her life.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:10%
She didn't just
stumble through life

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:10%
the way many people do,
especially at her age.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
From the time she weighed enough
to give blood, she gave it.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes she
would even pass out,

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and Sandra would drive her
home in the car, she'd say,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that's it, you're not
going to do this again.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
She'd say, no, I am going to
do this again, and she would.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
She would give blood whenever
she had the chance and--

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Pass out every time.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.464 align:middle line:84%
>>And she'd pass out
almost every time.

00:20:42.464 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the way she
lived her life.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.924 align:middle line:84%
If she thought it was the
right thing to do, she did it.

00:20:46.924 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And so many people know
the right thing to do,

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:90%
but they don't always do it.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't even
have to think about it.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>About three weeks
after Christina died,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
we had to go and pack up
her apartment up in Chico.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And I opened up a drawer
and I saw a makeup bag.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I opened up the makeup bag and
it had several pieces of paper

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
No makeup, but several
pieces of paper.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And among those papers
was this piece of paper

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that was folded and
a little tattered.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it
and I started to read.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And I realized it
was bucket list.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:55.615 align:middle line:84%
She never said I want to be
rich, I want to be famous.

00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
She didn't ask for
anything unreasonable.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.665 align:middle line:84%
She just wanted
to do normal stuff

00:22:02.665 --> 00:22:04.597 align:middle line:90%
and she never got to do that.

00:22:04.597 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Be in four places at once.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a place
called Four Corners.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.410 align:middle line:84%
You can actually go to the
edge of all four states, that's

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:90%
what she wanted to do.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:90%
But she's done this already.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Not by being there,
but with her organs.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Parts of her are
four places at once.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Her liver was split
between two people.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
One was a 55-year-old man and
one was a nine-month-old baby.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
A kidney, somebody
that the family knew.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Another man got the rest
of Christina's liver.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Her pancreas and the
other kidney went to a man

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:90%
in the South Bay.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And her heart went to
a 64-year-old woman

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.475 align:middle line:90%
from the South Bay at Stanford.

00:22:56.475 --> 00:23:00.245 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Lao Tzu said that I
have just three things

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
to teach, simplicity,
patience, and compassion.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
In an age where we run
from the depth of feeling

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and the teachings of
the heart, our fear

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
can reframe simplicity
as stupidity,

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
patience as laziness, and
compassion as sentimentality.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And therefore make them
not worthwhile to pick up.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Simplicity refers to direct
living, firsthand experience.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So the return to
touching life directly.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:84%
This restores our
wholeheartedness.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Patience also restores
us to wholeheartedness.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The urgencies we feel ever
present are mostly false.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Unless you or I can't
breathe or we're bleeding,

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:90%
there's no real urgency.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And compassion,
compassion literally

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
means to be with, to
keep honest company.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So when I am not directly
living, when I am not patient,

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to problem
solve your pain

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and not keep you
company with it.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.334 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.334 --> 00:24:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm often asked,
well that's fine,

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
but how can we do that
in the real world?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And I see it differently.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I've come to understand that
if you don't open your heart,

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:90%
then existence will crush you.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Not because there's something
evil about existence,

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:10%
but because the way
water fills a hole,

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:10%
if you don't meet the
world with who you are then

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:10%
everything around
will just fill you in.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's always a question,
yes, if I'm out in the world,

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I could get hurt, I could
get taken advantage of.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I could get betrayed.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:90%
My trust may not be rewarded.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:90%
This is all true.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
But I have found that
the cost for not staying

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
open hearted, whole hearted,
is that I lose access

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.915 align:middle line:90%
to my aliveness.

00:25:37.915 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>And we'll end up
walking lock step

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
in a society of consumerism, of
getting, of fear, and of worry.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:10%
And we will not
have lived our life.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:90%
We have a life to live.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.540 align:middle line:90%
The heart has the answers.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:10%
>>I was editor of a magazine,
I started that one years ago.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:10%
And I was looking
at this magazine.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:10%
And as usual, there
was this picture

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:10%
of the editor in
front of the magazine.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at myself
smiling, and I thought,

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:90%
it's not true.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:90%
This is not me.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But there was a sadness,
it was like a wave

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:90%
of sadness that washed me.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:90%
It was a really upset moment.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:90%
I can laugh at it now.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, who is
this me, or I, or self?

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
What is it in religion, or
in spiritual traditions,

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:90%
or in philosophy?

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>Every spiritual tradition
throughout history

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
has spoken about the heart as
being the seed of the soul.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:10%
The diamond in the heart,
the lotus and the heart,

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:10%
the temple in the heart.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:10%
Every tradition
speaks about the heart

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:10%
as being the essence
of who we are.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>The heart points to the most
essential dimension within you.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So to live in
connectedness with that,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
then you are in touch with
the power of the heart, which

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:90%
is the power of life itself.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:84%
The power of the
very intelligence

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that pervades and underlies
the entire universe.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Divine intelligence
is in your heart.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
You will not find your
soul in your intellect.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>And I suddenly thought,
wow, look at all these notes.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.580 align:middle line:90%
This could be a magazine.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.596 align:middle line:84%
And the title was easy, because
it made me really happy.

00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Happiness.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So to listen to your heart
can be very frightening,

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:84%
because you might have to lose
all the secure things that life

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
was giving you, like cars,
money, houses, everything.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I'm a person
who has a lot of fear.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Like for example,
every time that I

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:90%
have to write a new book.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Would I be able
to express myself?

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Would I be able
to share my soul?

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>When we consider
challenging fear,

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:84%
we're actually considering
shining the light of awareness

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:84%
on those places within
us that are fearful.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>There is nothing
wrong with fear.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that is wrong
is to be paralyzed by fear.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>So I thought, OK, I face
it, I just face it, this fear.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.180 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to me if this
magazine is not a success?

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.252 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I have to sell the house.

00:28:58.252 --> 00:28:59.460 align:middle line:90%
So I looked to another house.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.561 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.561 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
An area in the village where
you can rent a very cheap house.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:90%
I thought, can I live there?

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Of course I can live there.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a roof, it's a
house, I can live there.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I can handle this.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Whatever will
happen, we will live.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>And there's an
old Sioux saying

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that says, the longest journey
you will make in your life

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:90%
is from your head to your heart.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't because
we're stupid or we're slow.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:90%
It's because it takes time.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Before I had cancer, I
believed in the heart

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:84%
but I was living
it from my head.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And that journey, like snow
melting into the ground,

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the essence of my life
melted into my heart.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It took almost dying to make
that journey from my head

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.380 align:middle line:90%
to my heart.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Your primary
intention needs to be

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:84%
connectedness with the
heart at this moment.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>I have to act from a
place of good intention.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
A place of love
and kindness that

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
will allow me to
walk in this world

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.590 align:middle line:90%
without creating any damage.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>You may intend to
have a million dollars,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.603 align:middle line:84%
and that intention then
needs you to rob a bank.

00:30:32.603 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
If you really want the thing,
go to the heart and say,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:90%
this is what I want.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And the heart can say, I'll
show you how you get it.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:84%
You must be willing to work,
now, and trust me, now.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.040 align:middle line:90%
And then you can have it, yes.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:84%
If it's not going
to hurt anyone else.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Suppose you meet
someone who says,

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I intend to make more money.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says, that's
my intention.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.190 align:middle line:84%
You can ask him, why do you
want to make more money?

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll start to
learn some interesting things.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>If making money becomes
your primary goal,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.260 align:middle line:84%
then know that you
are not connected

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.420 align:middle line:84%
with the deepest
dimension in yourself

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:90%
that we call the heart.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And even if you achieve your
goal and make a lot of money,

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
you will find that
ultimately it leads

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:90%
to frustration and unhappiness.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Fulfill your dream, and
certainly money may come.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If money does not come, just
to have a life full of joy.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.100 align:middle line:84%
In my case, for
example, I never thought

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I would make a living
out of writing.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I was writing because
I wanted to do it.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I had no choice.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of
the day, not only

00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I made money out of writing,
but I made a lot of money

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:90%
out of writing.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>It often happens that when
your actions become empowered

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and contribute something
vital to this world,

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:84%
then abundance in
some form-- and it

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
may be in the form of money--
can sometimes flow to you.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>It was a great success.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Holland wanted this
magazine so it could grow,

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was the biggest
magazine of the Netherlands.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:90%
It came from the heart.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It was the real thing.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Wherever your heart is, there
you will find your treasure.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>The heart is who you are.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:90%
The heart defines you.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted
to meet that person,

00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.860 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that person had
to be pretty special to get

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Christina's heart.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Late one evening, my son got
a text message from a friend,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and said, tell your mom
to read the Facebook page.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Facebook,
and I saw a message.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And the message was,
I am Susan Vieira,

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and I believe I'm the recipient
of your daughter's heart.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was late, but I just
figured I'd message her anyway.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:90%
And she responded right back.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:32.431 align:middle line:84%
And I dialed her number,
and she picked up.

00:33:32.431 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And right away I just
felt a connection.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.084 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.084 --> 00:33:41.400 align:middle line:90%
I felt Christina.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And then when I heard this
she was a retired nurse,

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and that they had
so much in common,

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that it was like
Christina handpicked Susan

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:90%
to get her heart.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:10%
>>Christina and I
were both nurses.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I saw the bucket list, and
it's really a CV of my life.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>She wanted to manage
and own her own business.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, I did that.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>She wanted to get married.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, I've done that.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>She wanted to learn
how to fly a plane.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:90%

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.210 align:middle line:84%

She wanted to own two pieces of

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%

pieces of property,

At this point,
that's one I'm not

She can't go skydiving
or parachuting,

so we'll do that for her.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It won't be me because I'm too
scared, but it'll get done.

You are allowed to cry.

And in that book I sort of
glimpsed the whole thing.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I understood what had happened.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there
was no bad intention.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There was ignorance,
negligence, but not

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:90%
the purpose of harming her.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And I forgave, and
I've been able to live

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.610 align:middle line:84%
for 19 years with the spirit
of my daughter happily.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.760 align:middle line:10%
I don't carry that
burden with me.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:10%
>>Whenever I'm having a
difficult time forgiving,

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.320 align:middle line:10%
I think of Immaculee Ilibagiza.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>I was home for
[? Istauli ?] Day.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.140 align:middle line:90%
My brother come to my room--

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>You're still sleeping?

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>He looked like he was
awake for many hours.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>You don't know what happened?

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>I jumped out of
the bed, I never

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.439 align:middle line:84%
did this before in front of
my brother, put on my clothes.

00:38:57.439 --> 00:38:58.516 align:middle line:90%
>>We will win!

00:38:58.516 --> 00:38:59.593 align:middle line:90%
We will win!

00:38:59.593 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Find the cockroaches!

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Find the cockroaches!

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> He said,

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The president of our
country died last night.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>They're going to kill us.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>I come from a tribe of Tutsi.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.580 align:middle line:10%
It was well-loved.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:10%
And we kind of suspected
something might happen.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:84%
My parents sent me to
hide to a neighbor, who

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.185 align:middle line:90%
was from the Hutu tribe.

00:39:21.185 --> 00:39:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a protestant
pastor, and he

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:84%
put me to sleep in
a bathroom of three

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:84%
by four feet with
other seven women.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't talk, we couldn't
speak, as the man told us,

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>I won't even tell my children.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:90%
One mistake, one mistake.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.756 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I don't
trust my children,

00:39:39.756 --> 00:39:42.460 align:middle line:84%
but this mistake, it
would be too late for you

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.188 align:middle line:90%
and your life will be over.

00:39:46.188 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Don't use the shower.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.067 align:middle line:84%
>>Only flush the
water of the bathroom

00:39:52.067 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:84%
when someone is flushing the
water in the next bathroom.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.204 align:middle line:90%


00:39:58.204 --> 00:39:59.787 align:middle line:84%
>>I think
[? that we'll be in for ?] a

00:39:59.787 --> 00:40:01.540 align:middle line:90%
week or maybe less.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But if we are careful, we
might live through this.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.580 align:middle line:90%
Just be careful.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>We thought it was going
to be two, three days.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:17.385 align:middle line:84%
We spent in that
bathroom three months.

00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:20.342 align:middle line:84%
>>You must not let
your guard down.

00:40:20.342 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The Tutsi snakes are
hiding in the grass,

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.056 align:middle line:84%
so make sure that you have
your [INAUDIBLE] ready to chop

00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:90%
the snakes in half.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>We couldn't shower.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
We were waiting for killers
to find us every day.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're working
a field and spot

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:84%
a Tutsi woman in the bushes
breastfeeding her baby,

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.006 align:middle line:84%
don't waste a
golden opportunity.

00:40:39.006 --> 00:40:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Pick up your gun, shoot them,
chop the snakes in half.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget to kill the baby.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.280 align:middle line:90%
The child of a snake is a snake.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>They went home
by home to search,

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.570 align:middle line:90%
to see if anyone was hiding.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And this was a group that was
paid by the government, given

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:90%
food, and drink, smokes.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:84%
The first time they came,
I remember I was watching,

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.864 align:middle line:84%
and I saw them through the
tiny window of the bathroom.

00:41:02.864 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.732 align:middle line:84%
The men circled the house
so that no one jumps out

00:41:10.732 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:84%
of the window, and then
they started to scream.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:22.590 align:middle line:84%
They went in every room,
they went under the beds,

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.975 align:middle line:84%
they even opened suitcases to
make sure there was no babies

00:41:25.975 --> 00:41:26.775 align:middle line:90%
hiding.

00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.250 align:middle line:84%
They went in the
ceiling of the house

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:36.214 align:middle line:84%
with flashlights to make sure
no one is hiding in the ceiling.

00:41:36.214 --> 00:41:37.630 align:middle line:84%
They went on the
roof of the house

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to make sure no one
is laying there.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember asking, if you are
there, can control all this,

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:50.535 align:middle line:84%
please don't let them find
the door of the bathroom.

00:41:50.535 --> 00:41:53.240 align:middle line:84%
A thousand needles
went through your body.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.500 align:middle line:90%
It was painful.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.860 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a little
fear, it was a lot.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Your life was about to be over.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.310 align:middle line:84%
You are about to
be cut by machetes.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.555 align:middle line:90%
>>Where are the Tutsis?

00:42:05.555 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>No, no, no, don't know
what you're talking about.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good Hutu.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I would never hide Tutsis,
there are no Tutsis here.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.845 align:middle line:84%
I don't want any problem
with the government.

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:16.994 align:middle line:84%
You know me, I shall
protect this house.

00:42:16.994 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:84%
First those Tutsi rebels
come in and attack me

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.940 align:middle line:90%
for being such a good Hutu.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.269 align:middle line:84%
>>They came right to the
door of the bathroom.

00:42:23.269 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:90%
One of them touched the handle.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.741 align:middle line:90%


00:42:29.741 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:90%
He told the man,

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>You know what?

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.060 align:middle line:90%
I trust you.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.532 align:middle line:90%
You are a good man.

00:42:39.532 --> 00:42:40.576 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, thank you.

00:42:40.576 --> 00:42:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:45.658 align:middle line:90%
>>You are one of us now.

00:42:45.658 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.852 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, when we
saw him, we jumped.

00:42:51.852 --> 00:42:53.560 align:middle line:84%
We thought it was the
killers finding us.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>You're safe now.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.540 align:middle line:90%
You're lucky to be alive.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>We were completely numb
for the first five hours.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know how
you are praying,

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:90%
or if you're even praying.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.182 align:middle line:84%
But whatever you're doing,
please keep doing it.

00:43:07.182 --> 00:43:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, the feelings
I had in that bathroom

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:19.610 align:middle line:84%
were things I never
experienced in my life.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I had anger, anger I
cannot put in words.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes
people hate one person,

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:90%
and that's bad enough.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I hated like eight
million people.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
when I got out,

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a
soldier, and I will

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.050 align:middle line:84%
train my body, and muscles,
and just kill everybody.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:90%
In my anger, I was Rambo.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.740 align:middle line:84%
In some movies I have
seen, I was killing people.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.030 align:middle line:84%
With these thoughts I would
be swearing out of anger.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting in the
bathroom with these thoughts,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.680 align:middle line:84%
my head would be aching,
and my stomach is aching.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Why my thoughts are
provoking this poison?

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm only thinking of
things I want to do.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.820 align:middle line:84%
What is going on with
my thoughts here?

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.500 align:middle line:90%


00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>It's very hard to remember
love when we are scared.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Being afraid is one
of the strongest

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.080 align:middle line:90%
emotions in the world.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Our heart rate varies with
each and every heartbeat.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we're frustrated, and
anxious, and emotionally upset,

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:26.840 align:middle line:84%
the rhythm of the heart becomes
very incoherent and jagged.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And this basically
creates a noise

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:84%
in the system that drowns
out the intuitive signals.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>I remember thinking, this
home has two bathrooms.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:38.980 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't have
these two bathrooms,

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.520 align:middle line:84%
how could we have
been hidden here?

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:90%
They would have find us.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It was only home that had two
bathrooms inside the house,

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:90%
and that made me feel good.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.470 align:middle line:84%
When I was thinking the
good, it was so distinctive

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
because the feelings
were so high you

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:84%
can feel the difference
like someone just pushed you

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.180 align:middle line:90%
down and lifted you up.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Like it's so clearly.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.355 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking, we can eat.

00:45:06.355 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank God this man has children.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.590 align:middle line:84%
We can eat the leftovers,
even if it was not much.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So I started to see
the good, and it

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:90%
was like my heart was open.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Look at these people,
I can touch somebody.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Just to see the
good in everything.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Appreciation is a
heart related feeling.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:84%
It requires access
to the intelligence

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of the heart to appreciate,
or to have gratitude.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>And when I was thinking
that way, I felt much smarter.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>When we're in
a coherent state,

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the signal from the heart to
the brain is so much stronger.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It gets up to our frontal
cortex much clearer.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>That's the heart
knocking on your door,

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.590 align:middle line:84%
saying, open the
door, here I am.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.750 align:middle line:90%
You need me.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
say, ooh, where am I?

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.016 align:middle line:90%
I'm in hell.

00:45:55.016 --> 00:45:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.525 align:middle line:84%
But the heart tells
you, trust me.

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And when you're out of that--

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>It begins to shift the
energies very, very quickly

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.560 align:middle line:84%
so that you come into another
level of buoyancy that

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.530 align:middle line:90%
rises above the problem.

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, you
can then see into it.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.580 align:middle line:84%
You can then find
ways to deal with it.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>They're coming back.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>It was so clear in my heart.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.791 align:middle line:90%
This time they want to find you.

00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:28.146 align:middle line:90%
>>Pastor.

00:46:28.146 --> 00:46:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Push the wardrobe in
front of the door.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.443 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
see there is a door.

00:46:32.443 --> 00:46:33.832 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no, why?

00:46:33.832 --> 00:46:36.123 align:middle line:84%
If they come, they'll
realize it wasn't here.

00:46:36.123 --> 00:46:37.485 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm begging you.

00:46:37.485 --> 00:46:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.415 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:46:44.415 --> 00:46:48.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, I will put it.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>And it was so clear that
I need to listen to that.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:06.795 align:middle line:90%
They came to search.

00:47:06.795 --> 00:47:14.325 align:middle line:90%


00:47:14.325 --> 00:47:15.774 align:middle line:90%
>>Where is she, Pastor?

00:47:15.774 --> 00:47:17.926 align:middle line:84%
This is the last
place she was seen.

00:47:17.926 --> 00:47:19.372 align:middle line:90%
We know she's here.

00:47:19.372 --> 00:47:22.264 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.264 --> 00:47:23.228 align:middle line:90%
Immaculee!

00:47:23.228 --> 00:47:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>One of them said, I've
killed 399 cockroaches.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.876 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want
Immaculee to be the 400th.

00:47:36.876 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
this man, I knew him.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.920 align:middle line:84%
He was a school mate
in elementary school.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Someone I can call a friend.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:48.916 align:middle line:84%
How can somebody say he
killed 399 people by machete,

00:47:48.916 --> 00:47:51.380 align:middle line:90%
but he was proud?

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.516 align:middle line:90%
They went right in the wardrobe.

00:47:53.516 --> 00:48:00.656 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.656 --> 00:48:04.970 align:middle line:84%
They could have find us if
that wardrobe was not there.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And later he said, good idea.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even like I wanted
to take credit, like oh good,

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I had a good idea.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.380 align:middle line:84%
It was just like,
keep listening.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Know how to distinguish that
clarity that is not covered by

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.500 align:middle line:84%
hate, by envy, by jealousy,
by anything unloving.

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.350 align:middle line:90%
That is really how it comes out.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It comes as a
truth that you know

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:36.650 align:middle line:84%
is not motivated by
something not nice.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And the funny part,
when they left,

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.760 align:middle line:90%
the anger came right back.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It was just like a
[INAUDIBLE] oil coming back

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:47.510 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the water, like
a veil I pulled in front.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say,
I couldn't think.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my body's aching
again, and my headache.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But that's what you do when
people are killing your people.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:90%
You get angry.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't even think there was
another way to deal with this.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Despite the price I was
paying with my own body,

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't remember how
to smile cause of anger.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I felt like my
mouth was twisted.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I wished to be innocent again.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.360 align:middle line:90%
I wished to see good in people.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.660 align:middle line:90%
But for me, they were animals.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.190 align:middle line:90%
They were bad.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:25.460 align:middle line:90%
They were just evil people.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Every day I prayed about
200 our Lord's Prayer.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:33.950 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Any time I reached the part that
said, forgive us our trespasses

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:46.339 align:middle line:84%
as we forgive those who trespass
against us, I couldn't say it.

00:49:46.339 --> 00:49:49.032 align:middle line:84%
>>Give us this day
our daily bread.

00:49:49.032 --> 00:49:49.832 align:middle line:90%
Forgive--

00:49:49.832 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Any time I went through that
part it was like a red flag.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, how
can I deal with it?

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't forgive, because
this is unforgivable thing.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.920 align:middle line:90%
They tried to kill me.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.720 align:middle line:90%
How do you forgive such a thing?

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I wished I could, but it didn't
make sense in my situation.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So one time I said, wait a
minute, I have a better idea.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I thought, let me skip
that part of the prayer.

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So then I don't have to say
it, then I can say the rest.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So then within me, God is OK,
now he knows I'm not lying.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Lies don't sit well in the body.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And I start to skip it,
and I felt so much better.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So I edited it, and
now this voice says--

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>You are editing his prayer.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>If I were you, I wouldn't
try to edit his prayer.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can say
this laughing today,

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.960 align:middle line:84%
but that time my
mood was crushed.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember it was like giving
up, or can I call it surrender?

00:50:55.010 --> 00:51:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I went to my knees, and I put
my hands up, and I begged God.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
it back in prayer.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if you said pray
this way, you must know

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.860 align:middle line:90%
it is the right thing to do.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting it in your hands.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.910 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to
forgive, help me out.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I am willing.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.300 align:middle line:90%
That was a big shift.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:32.370 align:middle line:90%


00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember they came to a point
when it was like the world was

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:37.874 align:middle line:90%
divided in two parts.

00:51:37.874 --> 00:51:41.260 align:middle line:84%
A part of love,
and a part of hate.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:44.250 align:middle line:84%
In the part of love are
people like Mandela,

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.940 align:middle line:90%
like Mother Teresa, Gandhi.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:90%
People who suffered.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how
much they suffered,

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.570 align:middle line:90%
they still stand up for truth.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:55.300 align:middle line:84%
They still stand up
for love, for defense

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.640 align:middle line:90%
of another human being's rights.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And then on the side of hate,
I see people like Hitler,

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:04.200 align:middle line:84%
like those who were causing
genocide in Rwanda who

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.020 align:middle line:84%
are vengeful, angry,
like me at that time.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like God was asking
me, where do you want to stand?

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.364 align:middle line:90%
Where do you want to belong?

00:52:13.364 --> 00:52:17.346 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.346 --> 00:52:21.205 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to belong to side
of love or the side of hate?

00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:84%
People who belong
on the side of love,

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.930 align:middle line:90%
they have known injustice.

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:28.970 align:middle line:90%
They have known hate.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.180 align:middle line:84%
They have known how
to be treated bad.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.286 align:middle line:90%
But it's your choice.

00:52:32.286 --> 00:52:36.892 align:middle line:90%


00:52:36.892 --> 00:52:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, it was
so clear that I said,

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:43.000 align:middle line:84%
of course I want to be
with Gandhi, with Mandela.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.560 align:middle line:90%
I admire these people.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I admired Mother Teresa.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to be like them.

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.090 align:middle line:90%
So what did they do?

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:51.490 align:middle line:90%
They believed people can change.

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:57.010 align:middle line:84%
That was a huge shift in
my thinking in my body.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.840 align:middle line:90%
People do change.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, wait a minute.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people
can really change.

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Now, wait a minute again.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Look at me, I'm changing
with all these thoughts.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I realized that
people actually do change,

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:19.390 align:middle line:84%
people have the capacity
to see things differently,

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that's when I realized
I can let it go.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I moved from the
bathroom to a place of air.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:90%
That's how love felt in my body.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.000 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't smell nothing bad.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It was like I was floating.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.872 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
paradise in my heart.

00:53:40.872 --> 00:53:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought about the
killers, I should

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.740 align:middle line:90%
have compassion towards them.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the person who
killed 100 people, who

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.370 align:middle line:84%
have took away fathers and
mothers from their kids.

00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:59.420 align:middle line:84%
What are they going to become
when they wake up one day

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and they realize
what they're doing?

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Someone who begged
them for life?

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:14.490 align:middle line:90%


00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:17.850 align:middle line:84%
When we came out, it was
like end of the world.

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.444 align:middle line:84%
A million people
and more was killed.

00:54:20.444 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:84%
My mom, my father, my
two brothers, my grandma

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and my grandpa, neighbors.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.690 align:middle line:90%
My schoolmates, my best friends.

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:34.920 align:middle line:90%
It was the end of the world.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere was their bodies.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But something have
changed in my heart.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.330 align:middle line:90%
I was strong inside.

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I was really ready to face
life in a different way.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm a skeleton.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm 65 pounds.

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But inside, I felt huge,
I felt more beautiful.

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I felt like everybody
was just a gift of God,

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to serve,
to help, and to care.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.480 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
I'm being grateful

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.080 align:middle line:84%
for things I took
for granted forever.

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can say hi to somebody
without anyone killing me.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember in
evening, this nice wind.

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The trees are moving, I can
feel the wind in my body.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel this
for three months.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I can see the stars,
I can see the moon,

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:23.853 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
to pay for this.

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Did I ever looked at
the moon and said,

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.310 align:middle line:90%
wow, nice to have the moon?

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:29.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It was overwhelming feeling
of love and appreciation.

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to scream
to the whole world.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.775 align:middle line:90%
Do you see the beauty?

00:55:39.775 --> 00:55:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>The mind can understand
conceptually wholeness,

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:50.490 align:middle line:84%
but only the hard can
experience wholeness.

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And the reward, if we can
endure what we experience,

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:01.620 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't just
grasp oneness, we feel it.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Your head sees things
as black or white, wrong

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:19.290 align:middle line:90%
or right, bad or good.

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Head is always touching,
always off balance.

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:30.710 align:middle line:90%


00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>How long do I have to wait
for it to be white again?

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:40.070 align:middle line:90%


00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Just because you can't see
it doesn't mean it isn't there.

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:51.360 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:56.625 align:middle line:84%
The heart is much faster
and wiser than the head.

00:56:56.625 --> 00:57:00.020 align:middle line:84%
In the eyes of the heart,
black and white judgments

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:06.410 align:middle line:84%
disappear because the heart
is balanced by a deeper truth.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:12.370 align:middle line:84%
The great spirit spins together
moments of profound beauty

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:16.410 align:middle line:84%
that can only be
experienced with the heart.

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>I am forever grateful
for that bathroom.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.960 align:middle line:84%
To see where evil
can take people,

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.460 align:middle line:84%
but to see also where
love can take people.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Just realize the
weakness of people,

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:40.550 align:middle line:84%
but the strength that is
within each one of us.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.240 align:middle line:84%
To push me that far,
to dig within my heart,

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.786 align:middle line:84%
and to trust that
instinct within.

00:57:46.786 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>And when you can
give thanks for it all

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and love without conditions,
then you will be free.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.529 align:middle line:90%
That is the power of the heart.

00:58:01.529 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:90%


00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Life is full of challenges.

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Challenges and
hardships often times

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:16.040 align:middle line:84%
are the intense
heat and fire that

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.100 align:middle line:84%
break us open to
discover gifts, talents,

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and capacities within us that
we would have never discovered

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:23.870 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>So like a match
that holds fire,

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.420 align:middle line:84%
but until it strikes against
something you have no flame.

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:34.730 align:middle line:84%
By rubbing up
against experience,

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:40.569 align:middle line:84%
our heart comes aflame, and
light and warmth come from us.

00:58:40.569 --> 00:58:42.110 align:middle line:10%
>>You can even be
grateful for things

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:45.570 align:middle line:10%
that you imagine that
aren't any good for you.

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:48.140 align:middle line:10%
That you imagine that you don't
really want, or that you wish

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.270 align:middle line:10%
you hadn't had to experience.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Even in those moments,
masters say thank you to life,

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.979 align:middle line:84%
thank you to God, thank
you to the divine self

00:58:57.979 --> 00:58:59.270 align:middle line:90%
for this particular experience.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
before too long I

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:03.920 align:middle line:84%
will see the
extraordinary gift that

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:09.410 align:middle line:84%
has been folded into
this physical encounter.

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Six months after the genocide,
and people used to tell me,

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.140 align:middle line:90%
you can't forgive this quick.

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It's too quick to be happy.

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't be smiling
after what happened.

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.132 align:middle line:90%


00:59:26.132 --> 00:59:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And that really kind of made
me question a little bit

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:30.890 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, am I happy and forgiving
out of surviving mechanism?

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to crush one day?

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Which many people told me,
on one day, if you see them,

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:45.300 align:middle line:90%
you will go back to the anger.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So I went to prison to see the
person who have killed my mom

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and my brother, whom I would
not have gone to meet him.

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:57.540 align:middle line:90%
It didn't serve me one bit.

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So I went there just to
really see how I feel.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have learned
the head of the jail

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
is a friend of my
father who lost his wife

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.310 align:middle line:90%
and like five children.

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So I knew he would
open the door for me.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>You can hit him,
you can do whatever

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:20.440 align:middle line:90%
you want because I'm here now.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I will protect you.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:24.250 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.710 align:middle line:90%
So ease up your pain.

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:44.368 align:middle line:90%


01:00:44.368 --> 01:00:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>And he brought the man.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.670 align:middle line:90%


01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I remember him.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:53.950 align:middle line:90%
He used to be a teacher.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:56.020 align:middle line:90%
He was like a father to me.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.520 align:middle line:90%
He had kids my age.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I used to visit them, and
have lunch with the family.

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Now that's him who did that?

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.980 align:middle line:90%
I just broke down and cried.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.660 align:middle line:90%


01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And I truly cried
out of compassion

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.030 align:middle line:90%
towards him and his family.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:42.365 align:middle line:90%


01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>I forgive you.

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:50.780 align:middle line:90%


01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.265 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

01:01:52.265 --> 01:01:56.750 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>It wasn't like, oh, I
planned to say these words.

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
There's something I
wanted to express,

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't find
words to say it fully.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I wanted him to be free from me.

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Not to think, oh,
she's mad at me.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.804 align:middle line:90%
You know, I can't do nothing.

01:02:11.804 --> 01:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted him
to have a chance

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
to go through his own
journey from his own heart,

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
not because somebody
is angry at him,

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:20.085 align:middle line:90%
or someone put him in a prison.

01:02:20.085 --> 01:02:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>What is wrong with you?

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:28.230 align:middle line:90%


01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>And the head of
the jail was so mad.

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:33.666 align:middle line:90%
>>What is wrong with you, huh?

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
You do not know
what he did to us?

01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
You do not love
your parents, huh?

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.100 align:middle line:90%
You forget?

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.165 align:middle line:84%
>>I forgot that
the man was there,

01:02:44.165 --> 01:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and actually who
lost his family, too.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.910 align:middle line:90%
And I really felt bad.

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:50.645 align:middle line:90%
>>You forgive a killer?

01:02:50.645 --> 01:02:54.470 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong with you?

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.170 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong with you?

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh my God, why
did I forgive him?

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:02.050 align:middle line:90%
But I did, I wanted to.

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to free him.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But it felt more
like weakness, it

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
felt like-- somewhere I
knew it was the right thing.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>It's the most horrifying tale.

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet she, and many people
living through that genocide,

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
have found it in their hearts
to forgive and to move on.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Forgiveness is everything.

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:28.210 align:middle line:90%


01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
When I think of forgiveness, I'm
brought to weep with gratitude

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.400 align:middle line:90%
that it exists.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, forgiveness doesn't
mean that you're condoning

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:42.380 align:middle line:90%
someone else's behavior.

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important point.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness merely
means that you're

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
freeing yourself up
from the energy blocks

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:50.720 align:middle line:90%
that you're holding.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Those resentments
that you're carrying.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>There's a song, a Gospel song.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And it says, (SINGING)take
your burden to the Lord

01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:07.670 align:middle line:90%
and leave them there.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Leave them there,
oh, leave them there.

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Take your burden to the
Lord and leave them there.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:21.800 align:middle line:84%
If you trust Him, never doubt,
he will surely bring you out.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Take your burden to the
Lord and leave them-- now,

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
there is that, and
there are people

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that sing that with such
fervor and such confidence.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And those are the same
people who take their burden,

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:39.185 align:middle line:84%
say there my burdens, and then
they get up and take the burden

01:04:39.185 --> 01:04:39.985 align:middle line:90%
with them.

01:04:39.985 --> 01:04:42.590 align:middle line:90%
And they go-- [LAUGHS]

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>How can we connect
with the heart?

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:53.135 align:middle line:84%
Well, your starting point is
all you ever have, this moment.

01:04:53.135 --> 01:04:56.550 align:middle line:90%


01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>We are so busy all the time.

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no time, no space,
no silence for the heart.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Unless you actually
can be out in nature,

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and experience the birds
singing, and the trees,

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and the blue sky,
you are divorced

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
from the great spiritual being
that I feel is all around us.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've been so lucky to spend
months and months on my own

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:23.660 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you can become
a whole human

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
being with heart, and
brain, and spirit, all

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:33.230 align:middle line:90%
connected and whole.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>That's why maybe
people meditate or pray,

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
because they need that
space, that moment when

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.080 align:middle line:90%
you listen to the heart.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Every storm has a hole in
the center the size of a navel

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
through which a gull
can fly in silence.

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>And so you become calm.

01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:59.100 align:middle line:90%
You must become calm.

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what
to do, do nothing.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Don't fill your time with
trivia, simply do nothing.

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Simply sit.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Breathe.

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
All the traditions
speak about the value

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
of meditation,
reflection, contemplation,

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.530 align:middle line:90%
which all center on breathing.

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Because breath restores us
to the safety of the moment.

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Now you want to breathe a
little deeper and a little

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.520 align:middle line:90%
slower than you normally would.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
About a four or five second on
the in-breath, and four or five

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.030 align:middle line:90%
seconds on the out breath.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:36.696 align:middle line:84%
But you don't hold
your breath, you just

01:06:36.696 --> 01:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
get a nice rhythm, that
pace, holding your tension

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.580 align:middle line:90%
in the area of the heart.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.130 align:middle line:10%
>>Bring your awareness
to your heart.

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:46.720 align:middle line:10%
Bring your conscious
awareness into your heart.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>And you may be
able maybe to hear.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I ask my heart all
the time for guidance.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Your heart has a very good
way to tell you whether you're

01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:03.290 align:middle line:90%
in a good path or not.

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%
It's called enthusiasm.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>I let in whatever's
around me, and I

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.310 align:middle line:90%
ask, where's the aliveness now?

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>When I'm playing with
the kids, when I make love

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
to my husband, when I read a
good book, when I'm writing

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that the
character becomes a person

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and talks to me,
then my heart also

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
feels fluttering, and
with laughter, with joy.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Why everything has
to be so serious?

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.565 align:middle line:84%
>>It's very important
to have fun.

01:07:38.565 --> 01:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Even the middle of something
that you are doing that

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.240 align:middle line:90%
requires a lot of discipline.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And so to connect to your
heart, become a child.

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>My dear friend
George came to Greece.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.950 align:middle line:90%
This guy is a billionaire.

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And he is very big.

01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%
He started talking, and I said--

01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Listen.

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
If you want to talk
with me, come with me.

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>I took him out in
the central of Athens

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:04.782 align:middle line:90%
where we have a trampoline.

01:08:04.782 --> 01:08:10.959 align:middle line:90%


01:08:10.959 --> 01:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>We're not going to talk
business unless you follow me

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.640 align:middle line:90%
on the trampoline, man.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no, no, no.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.939 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, yes, yes, together.

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm not going on a trampoline.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>You're a difficult guy
to get undressed, man.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:27.467 align:middle line:90%


01:08:27.467 --> 01:08:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>He came up on the trampoline
for the first time in his life,

01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and we started jumping together,
up and down, up and down.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:37.510 align:middle line:90%
140 kilos, no?

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Hey, you could
become a champion

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.299 align:middle line:90%
if you train a little bit.

01:08:40.299 --> 01:08:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Next Olympic games, OK?

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.746 align:middle line:90%
I will be your manager, man!

01:08:43.746 --> 01:08:50.038 align:middle line:90%


01:08:50.038 --> 01:08:51.903 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:08:51.903 --> 01:08:53.319 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what a good
boy you are, man!

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:57.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I like it!

01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:00.029 align:middle line:84%
>>He was so happy,
like a little child.

01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:02.560 align:middle line:90%


01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.779 align:middle line:90%
The child is hidden.

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:06.779 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's a child, even
him, who is a billionaire.

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>And the child is
saying, hello, I'm here.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.439 align:middle line:84%
But we think, oh,
we are grown up,

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
listen to this child.

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Because this child
has childish dreams.

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And so we forget the child.

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:30.189 align:middle line:84%
And from the moment that
we forget the child,

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
we think the child is
going to forget us.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.149 align:middle line:84%
The child is not
going to forget us.

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:41.529 align:middle line:84%
This child will be here
always, hello, I'm here.

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:42.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to you.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:44.279 align:middle line:90%
Can you listen?

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.699 align:middle line:90%
And then we say, shut up.

01:09:47.699 --> 01:09:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to listen to you.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But the day that
you're facing death,

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
this child will be there, and
are going to ask you again,

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.890 align:middle line:90%
why didn't you listen to me?

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:07.002 align:middle line:90%
And then you have to answer.

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And your answer will be
your hell or your heaven.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>The difference between
being childish and childlike

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:24.460 align:middle line:84%
is that being childish reduces
our world and returns us

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.560 align:middle line:90%
to being self-centered.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Being childlike
returns us to wonder.

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>It's wonderful
to be like a child

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.530 align:middle line:90%
if you still can practice this.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in new places, or
new cities, or new areas,

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm as Alice in Wonderland.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Then the heart goes open again.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>And then I feel
my heart exploding.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, I feel the
heat of the heart.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>And it is wonderfully
liberating and empowering

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:56.140 align:middle line:84%
to be aligned with
the heart, that which

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.200 align:middle line:90%
underlies all creation.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is then that often you
find helpful factors coming

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
into your life out
of nowhere, and those

01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
are synchronistic
events that usually

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
are confirmation that you are
connected to that deeper level.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Synchronicity this word
that was created by Carl Jung.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
When something appears
to be a coincidence,

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
but you know that there's
more to it than that.

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>For example, you get a phone
call just at the right moment.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Something that becomes
helpful factor,

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and you cannot explain
causally how that happened.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Synchronicity is a miracle.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that you can do
is to be open to synchronicity.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>It is as if a
filter drops away,

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and we notice that
synchronicity is all around us.

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
That this isn't an
accidental universe.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>When we were waiting
to hear from the doctors,

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I had one of
Christina's jackets.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And I reached into the pockets
and I pulled out a fortune

01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:11.610 align:middle line:90%
from a fortune cookie.

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:16.955 align:middle line:84%
We must always have old
memories and young hopes.

01:12:16.955 --> 01:12:19.515 align:middle line:90%


01:12:19.515 --> 01:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was a sign for
us that she was gone.

01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>And immediately I just
thought this was like--

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>A final message.

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Her final message to us.

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:38.816 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the old memories were
the old memories with her,

01:12:38.816 --> 01:12:40.760 align:middle line:90%
with Christina.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And the young hopes, or
the optimism, you know,

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.810 align:middle line:90%
she was 21 years old.

01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
She looked ahead
to her whole life.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.260 align:middle line:84%
To me it was telling
us that we have

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to pick up where she left off,
even though I'm not 21 anymore.

01:12:57.270 --> 01:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to adopt that
philosophy and try

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:07.292 align:middle line:84%
to live up to the young
hopes for the future

01:13:07.292 --> 01:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that you can have,
and that you can

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.400 align:middle line:90%
make a difference in the world.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Synchronicity is largely due
to intuition, where we end up

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
in the right place at
the right time because

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:18.410 align:middle line:90%
of that inner guidance.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:21.170 align:middle line:84%
In other experiments
we've done, we

01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
see that the heart can know the
information about 20 seconds

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.520 align:middle line:90%
before hand.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But in real life,
our intuition's

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
not limited by these
experimental protocols.

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
to be careful not

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to say that, well,
intuition is only

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.340 align:middle line:90%
20 seconds before an event.

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
in the real world,

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
it can be hours and
sometimes even days

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.410 align:middle line:90%
before an event actually occurs.

01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Most people instantly think
about going to Las Vegas

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.740 align:middle line:90%
and gambling or something.

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:49.070 align:middle line:84%
If intuition really
works as I'm suggesting,

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
it's really our own
spirit working with us.

01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's not always in our best
behalf from that interaction

01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:57.372 align:middle line:84%
between our higher
self, or our soul,

01:13:57.372 --> 01:13:58.580 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Every culture has
their own name for it.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
That we go to Las Vegas
and just win all the time.

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So intuition is really
our own best friend.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:08.005 align:middle line:84%
It's really the moment
to moment inner guidance.

01:14:08.005 --> 01:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we get that
feeling that something's

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
just not right, or we
shouldn't do something.

01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be a positive
feeling that we really

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
should do something, or
go to a certain place.

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>I remember the day before
the genocide happened.

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
My brother came home, he
spent a day with his friends,

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and he told us that he heard
a rumor that they were going

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.740 align:middle line:90%
to kill every Tutsi that night.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And we were, our
family, on the list.

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.382 align:middle line:84%
>>I cannot move the family
just because you heard a rumor.

01:14:38.382 --> 01:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>What if it's true,
and in the morning--

01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Stop it.

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:41.700 align:middle line:90%
No fear.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.085 align:middle line:84%
Just trust in God
and forget about it.

01:14:44.085 --> 01:14:47.410 align:middle line:90%


01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:48.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>We should move.

01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:52.040 align:middle line:90%
This is so important.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It's 10 minutes away, we
can just take the boat,

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and come back in the
morning if nothing.

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>I know, but we must
trust our father, too.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>I know, you're right.

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:03.310 align:middle line:90%
We should, right?

01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Because he always
has good judgment.

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>We should.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>It was so clear in my
heart that my decision was

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.270 align:middle line:90%
to move away from the country.

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:middle line:90%
By the morning, it was too late.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
They had blocked
all the borders.

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
That lesson completely
changed my heart forever.

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Now when I have that feeling,
I do listen to my heart,

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:31.890 align:middle line:90%
no matter who is saying what.

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:34.960 align:middle line:90%
I have to listen to my heart.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if you don't
trust the heart,

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.260 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to trust?

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe the heart is
the only thing we can trust.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>When we get to the point
where we have experienced

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
this transformation
within ourselves, where

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
living from love
rather than fear

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
has transformed our
own life circumstances,

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
then we become channels,
we become vessels.

01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We have the moral
authority by which

01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to state that possibility
for the planet.

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Just before she
passed, I was telling her

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:10.980 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been off work
for a couple of years,

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and we retired.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
looking for something

01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
meaningful to do with
the rest of my life,

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:19.980 align:middle line:90%
because I was still young.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
something will come along.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:27.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll know it when
it comes along.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And when she passed,
I knew instantly

01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that we had to
continue her work.

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:34.180 align:middle line:10%
And so we started the
foundation, the Christina

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:38.760 align:middle line:10%
Chesterman Memorial Foundation,
to just build on the legacy

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.900 align:middle line:10%
that she left already.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>As you live from the
heart and more humans

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:48.510 align:middle line:84%
begin to live from the heart,
that has a ripple effect.

01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It ripples out from where you
are, and then you get it back.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Every day you work at it.

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Every day you go to the heart.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Every day you speak to me.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>In fact, I start
each morning with what

01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.600 align:middle line:90%
we call a heart lock in.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Just getting coherent
and really sending myself

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.850 align:middle line:84%
love and appreciation
for a few minutes,

01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to start my day from
a more coherent,

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.080 align:middle line:84%
composed, and
connected perspective.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Then throughout the day you've
got to kind of reboot that.

01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So really it's developing
kind of a flow through life.

01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So all the in-between
moments, as I call them.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Like in between here
and the lunch room,

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
or between here and
the photocopier.

01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Those in-between moments
are perfect opportunities

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:37.974 align:middle line:84%
to breathe in that appreciation,
or that state of inner ease.

01:17:37.974 --> 01:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
to breathe anyway,

01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
so we might as well
make it more effective.

01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>And if we can
calm down enough,

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.590 align:middle line:90%
we can listen to the wisdom.

01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We learn how to be good
neighbors, good visitors.

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.136 align:middle line:90%
How to be good parents.

01:17:57.136 --> 01:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
How to be good
workers, good teachers.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:06.022 align:middle line:84%
We learn how to
be good citizens.

01:18:06.022 --> 01:18:08.402 align:middle line:90%
Good human beings.

01:18:08.402 --> 01:18:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Because we listen.

01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And not try to put
our voices in it.

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Just listen.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>The heart is my guru.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.910 align:middle line:84%
For all gurus I've met,
this one is the real one.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Ask your heart any question.

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.480 align:middle line:90%
What do I want?

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.570 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose in life?

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:32.770 align:middle line:84%
What are the qualities that
I look for in a good friend?

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
What are the qualities
that I contribute to

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.630 align:middle line:90%
in a good relationship?

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
What are my unique
skills and talents?

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.640 align:middle line:84%
How do I use this
to serve humanity?

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.628 align:middle line:84%
Your heart knows
all the answers.

01:18:44.628 --> 01:18:50.946 align:middle line:90%


01:18:50.946 --> 01:18:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>I still feel lost.

01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:55.690 align:middle line:90%


01:18:55.690 --> 01:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what to do
with my life anymore.

01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.935 align:middle line:84%
>>Take the question
to your heart.

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>I have been.

01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:04.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting any answers.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>You're thinking, it's
harder than it really is.

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Just follow that
lightness in your heart,

01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and that will eventually lead
you to a life of purpose.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of the biggest questions
of the heart unfold as a path,

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.180 align:middle line:90%
not an answer.

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:26.200 align:middle line:90%


01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.880 align:middle line:10%
>>Following our aliveness
without attaching

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.670 align:middle line:10%
what it will become.

01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Not to become a poet,
but I'm brought alive

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
by the questions and
the life of expression.

01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Not to become a singer,
but to be brought alive

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.700 align:middle line:90%
by voice coming out of you.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>We begin to connect from
our center and not just

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.250 align:middle line:90%
from surface personality.

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different way
of moving through the world.

01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And when one moves through
the world like this,

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and when we begin to move
through the world like this,

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
then the realm of ever
expanding good-- another name

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.996 align:middle line:84%
for heaven-- begins to be
revealed on our planet.

01:20:12.996 --> 01:20:16.350 align:middle line:90%


01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>We cannot see tomorrow's
sky, but the heart sees it.

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And we will be
directed as to how we

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:28.650 align:middle line:90%
should act in tomorrow's sky.

01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
More than likely,
we already know.

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't, the heart
will tell us, if we listen.

01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:59.180 align:middle line:90%


01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.117 align:middle line:90%
>>This is for you, sweetheart.

01:21:02.117 --> 01:24:15.809 align:middle line:90%
