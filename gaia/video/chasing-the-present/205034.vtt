00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:41.837 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.837 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know what was
going on in my life when I was

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:90%
younger.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of lost, so I just
drank as much as I could bottle

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
after bottle and
smoked as much weed

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:84%
as I could and then
started taking acid.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And at 16 years old,
I lost my girlfriend.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
She overdosed on acid
and committed suicide.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I kept going
to the point I was 21,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and I was alone in my
apartment for three days

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
just doing coke like
crazy, and I flatlined.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I ate a whole bag because I
thought that the cops were

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:84%
coming and started hallucinating
and literally, I flatlined,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and from that point
on, I was like,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
happening in my life.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So I quit stuff, and
I became a vegetarian.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.863 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not saying
that everybody

00:01:24.863 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:10%
should be a vegetarian,
but for me, that

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.183 align:middle line:10%
was the turning point
in my life because I

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:10%
feel like it's the
first time in my life

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:10%
where I started to be aware,
just being more aware of what I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:10%
put in my body.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make sense to do
a juice cleanse and then

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
the next day, to go to
the bar and get hammered.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I opened a lot of
vegetarian and vegan

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:90%
restaurants and vegan hotel.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having these
healthy businesses,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:90%
and I'm trying to help people.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And I don't do drugs anymore.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't do this.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And I did all this other stuff.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I kind
of got addicted to work.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can do
everything that way,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
probably little drama
still because he's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.042 align:middle line:90%
friends with some of the staff.

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's stuff that we'll
always deal with probably,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:90%
What happens after she signs it?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Because she told me--

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.105 align:middle line:90%
I haven't written her back.

00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped those
other things, and I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
started working like crazy
amounts and became successful.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was still waking up
in the middle of the night

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and going to the emergency room
because my heart was skipping

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:84%
beats, and I was having
full-blown anxiety and panic

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:90%
attacks.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Anxiety.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:90%
My face is tingling.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:35.758 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what was happening.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I would wake up in the
middle of the night

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
sometimes and feel this
fear taking over me

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
to the point where my
heart was skipping beats,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't even speak
because my face was getting

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
so tingly and numb, and my whole
body was kind of tightening up.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, I
felt like I was dying.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.912 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:10%
And then that's how
this journey started.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:10%
I was super confused because
I had all this fear in me,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:10%
but on the other hand, I was
totally secure in terms of what

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:10%
the world kind of taught me.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:10%
I was secure.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:10%
I had a house and good
job and was making money.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:10%
So it didn't make sense.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.313 align:middle line:10%
I didn't really understand
what the hell was

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:10%
going on to feel these
things and to have everything

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:10%
that I thought that I
was supposed to have.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:10%
So we've been traveling around
the world for the last two

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:10%
years with the
effort of me really

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.887 align:middle line:10%
understanding who I am better.

00:03:36.887 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:10%
But for me, it was a
very challenging thing,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:10%
and it still is.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.540 align:middle line:10%
It takes focus, and
it takes dedication,

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:10%
and it takes a really
strong will to do it.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:04:10.460 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad you made
it back all right.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
All those places.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> A long way, man.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a long trip.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> You wouldn't go?

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think so.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
anything I want to see

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
to be on a plane for that long.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> What about baby pandas?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I go to Busch Gardens
and see them nice and easy.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What if we go tomorrow to
China to see the baby pandas?

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think so.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was working, I felt
like something was not right

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.895 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really understand
what it was or whatever,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
so going on this trip kind of
helped me understand that stuff

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
By doing yoga in India and
doing meditation and doing

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff, I
started to kind of figure

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.123 align:middle line:90%
out what was going on.

00:06:56.123 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Why do you hit me like that?

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I think you're cracking
up on me, but it's all right.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean?

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.408 align:middle line:90%
>> You're cracking up.

00:07:04.408 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is it cracking up?

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So you found
yourself in India?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.503 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not about finding
myself or something.

00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:90%
It's about realizing--

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it all feel right now?

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Now that you went on
to India and Nepal,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:90%
does it feel right now?

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:90%
feels good?

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not so hard to go to
India for a month and practice

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
yoga and feel good and being
yourself and hang out with

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:90%
those people.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have much worries.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:90%
You're not working.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:90%
You're away from everything.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything's nice,
and it's much easier.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's more challenging
when you go home,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and you talk to your dad,
you talk to your mom,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:90%
you talk to friends.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
You try to explain the stuff
that you're going through

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and the stuff that you
learned in the East,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's challenging.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> As I say pretty
much every week,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
we are a social species and that
our biggest core drive in life

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning is
to connect with others.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:84%
We survive simply
because in infancy, we

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
can bond with other
adults who will nurture us

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.539 align:middle line:84%
until we reach an
age where we can

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:84%
survive without constant
care and support.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So the core neural components
of the brain from birth

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
are simply, again, to
establish these bonds.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And these bonds are
established by looking

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:90%
into the eye of someone--

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
your parents, your
caregivers, the other adults--

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
having them see you and then
express whatever state you're

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:90%
in through your emotions.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So you're tired, you're
frustrated, you're sad,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
you're lonely,
you're vulnerable,

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
you express that
physiologically.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Those times where we feel
disconnected from care,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
from love, support, are the
greatest traumas of childhood.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Those negative
emotions we believe

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:84%
are some kind of really
horrible part of ourselves

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want
to experience,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and the key to soothing us
which means regulating us back

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to a state of calmness
is that experience

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
of being seen in the eye of
someone who will be empathetic

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.365 align:middle line:90%
and will meet these needs.

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I reckon fear,
anger, anxiety,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:84%
these are on a basic
biochemical level, signals.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Signal is communication.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Communication is an attempt to
create community, connection,

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:90%
togetherness.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I suppose people feel fearful
and angry because they're not

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
being heard, and I
don't necessarily

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:90%
mean on an individual level.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
But my sense is there's
an aspect of spirit that's

being neglected.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
If you ignore it,
fear will happen.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.975 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:31.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, James.

00:10:31.775 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:90%
This is Zelda here.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I have time for a session
with you at 2:00 PM.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:90%
I hope that suits you.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Just let me know.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I realized
actually like, well,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:90%
anxiety is a big thing for me.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like I ever
gave it the attention

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:90%
that it kind of needed.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking into it and
also through work with you,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a lot of it
comes from my childhood.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know,
I still have it,

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.397 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a little bit
confused because on the trip,

00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I've heard different things
from different people.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to go back to the
root of every single thing

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:84%
in my life that could
have caused anxiety,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:90%
for example, when I was a kid?

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Or is it good enough to
just sit with the anxiety

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
when it comes up
and just feel it?

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> People often ask
that in therapy,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
do I need to go into every
single thing that happened

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
in my childhood in order to
really change this thing that

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm having trouble with?

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But you do need to go
into it as it comes up.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
When you stay with
things for a while,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
if you allow yourself
to be present with them,

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
then you start
noticing something

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:90%
that wants to be addressed.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And yes, then it's
useful to deal with that.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
That's a useful thing
to do with somebody else

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
like have somebody
guiding you in it to give

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:90%
enough safety in the situation.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'd like to try
it out a little bit now?

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we can.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's just take a
couple of deep breaths there.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Just check in with yourself
if that is actually

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.316 align:middle line:84%
what you want to
do at the moment,

00:12:27.316 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
just so we're really sure that's
the right thing to be doing

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:90%
now, here, now, this situation.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, are you sure you
want to try this out now?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.851 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Boy, this is beautiful.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> This swimming pool
is their swimming pool.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
It's in the backyard
of their house,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and it's very, very nice.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now we're
going to go inside.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If we were to take a survey
out in the world of all 7

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.830 align:middle line:84%
billion people, and we
were to ask everyone,

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
what is it that you
really want in life,

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
there would be a variety
of answers from more money,

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
better health, an intimate
relationship, a family,

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:84%
a nicer home, but then if
we were to ask everyone,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
but why do you want more money
or a better home or an intimate

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
relationship, they would say
because I think it will make me

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:90%
happy.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
In other words, everybody
seeks happiness above all else.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
greater than happiness.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And nearly everybody
seeks happiness

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:84%
through the acquisition of some
kind of objective experience--

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:84%
an object, a substance,
a state of mind,

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
an activity, an intimate
relationship, a family,

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Many people at some
stage in their lives

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
begin to suspect that
happiness for which they seek

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
can never be delivered via
an objective experience.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's the madness from which
the vast majority of humanity

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:90%
are suffering.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually feel like somehow
anxiety is starting to come up,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and my face like a
little bit tingly and--

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody really wants to be
happy not just in a superficial

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:90%
sense.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
We want a sense of belonging,
each of us, to this body,

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to this mind, to this
Earth, somewhere.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We want a sense of being
a part of something

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:84%
greater than our limited sense
of who we are, but what are we

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:90%
taught?

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy to figure out.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to separate from
a lot of conditioning

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and be able to look
at it to say, Oh

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:90%
this is where happiness lies.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We live in a rigidly
controlled society,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
rigidly structured, which seeks
to press us down and turn us

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
only into vehicles for
production and consumption.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
That's all we are supposed
to be in the present set up.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear and desire
provoke action.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:84%
They cause you to get
out of the present.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're continually
being frightened,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
turn on your TV set, look at

sex you're into.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's very hard.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel like culture's got jump
leads on my consciousness.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It keeps sending signals
that are not helpful.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not a coincidence, is it?
consumerism and capitalism?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:90%
That's where we've all got to.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've all generated
through our consciousness.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what we are
all participating in,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%

to find it hard to go,

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:90%

I'm not going to
try and earn money.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to sit quietly
by the river and breathe.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll sit there quietly
for a while and breathe.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.942 align:middle line:84%

see if anyone's called

It's OK.

Try not to explain it too much.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%

to feel, James.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
realize that until recently
that I don't actually

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
need acknowledgment from
anything outside of myself.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
That maybe there's a way
that I could feel good enough

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:84%
inside myself to the
point where I don't need

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to do things for other
people to feel that,

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:84%
or I could just
feel that in myself.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:90%
I could be whole in myself.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> So your anxiety's OK now?

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's better for sure
because I feel like growing up

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.635 align:middle line:84%
with wanting to
be good in school,

00:24:58.635 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
wanting to be good at sports,
wanting to do all this kind

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
of stuff-- you know,
the American dream--

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.750 align:middle line:90%
you have to grow up.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to make a
certain amount of money.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
certain amount of cars.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.705 align:middle line:84%
You have to get the shoes
that the neighbor has.

00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.828 align:middle line:90%
You know exactly what I mean.

00:25:10.828 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, some of it's valid.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
don't go to school,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get As,
you don't get a good job.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot in common.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.302 align:middle line:84%
>> But whatever it is, it
puts a lot of pressure on us.

00:25:21.302 --> 00:25:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Once you get older, you
don't need that stuff.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
You realize you don't need
that same kind of pressure

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:90%
from society anymore.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:90%
We make our own choices.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.330 align:middle line:90%
So I went on this trip to--

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:84%
that stuff did create
anxiety in my life.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I was younger, I would
get drunk with my friends.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I'd smoke weed.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many times I did it.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.420 align:middle line:90%
You didn't see anxiety.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know that that's
why I was doing it, but now,

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I can figure out--

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So how did you figure
out that you had anxiety?

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
When did this
anxiety thing pop up?

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Just I had it.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I had panic attacks
when I lived in Europe.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
In Bali, had it
a couple of times

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.618 align:middle line:84%
where I went to
the emergency room

00:25:57.618 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
because my heart was
beating at a different rate,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.325 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't feel my face.

00:26:01.325 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I used to call mom
sometimes and pull over

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.920 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the highway when
I was like 20, 21, couldn't

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.917 align:middle line:90%
even talk.

00:26:07.917 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll be straight.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you that I
never had anxiety ever.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I could fix your anxiety,
a little 10% you got left,

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:84%
it's either a right
hand or a left hook.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.898 align:middle line:90%
Which would you prefer?

00:26:17.898 --> 00:26:19.148 align:middle line:90%
>> You think what will fix it?

00:26:19.148 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the end
of your anxiety.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.615 align:middle line:90%
You wake up, you'll be healed.

00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:84%
You are going to say, I
don't want that shit again,

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:90%
so my anxiety is gone.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.015 align:middle line:90%
It's all good, bro.

00:26:31.015 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it wasn't all good,
and now it's getting better.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing
that's happening.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It should get better.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 10 million miles
later, and you know?

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:41.104 --> 00:26:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead of seeing it
just as craziness out there,

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:58.218 align:middle line:84%
begin to see it as suffering,
because we see it on ourselves.

00:26:58.218 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We see the suffering that
a lot of these mindsets

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:84%
of greed and desire, wanting,
and hatred and fear that

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:90%
are playing out in the world.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.500 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that in our own
minds and see the suffering,

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.820 align:middle line:90%
understand the suffering of it.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course, a lot of
good work, great work,

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
can be done at
alleviating and addressing

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:90%
the symptoms of the suffering.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:90%
But what's the cause?

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:84%
What's the underlying
cause of these problems?

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think as a species,
we have to realize that there

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:90%
is a solution to the problem.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is a way
to stop our suffering.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to find out what the
root of this suffering is,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and if we look carefully, we
can see that this egoic, I,

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:90%
belief set that we have.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It comes from some software
that we generated for ourselves

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
35,000 years ago that was
very useful at the time.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's not working.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:84%
People from chimpanzees
6 million years ago.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
We went through 6 million
years minus 75,000 years,

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and we were just like--
there were four other species

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:84%
like us running around,
very, very competitive.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we said,
what we got to do?

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, we developed this way
of saying, OK, symbolic logic.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I can represent this
by drawing that.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I can point to this, and you'll
know, Oh, that's this thing.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
That may sound simple,
but that's a big deal

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because then there's a you,
a subject, and an object

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:84%
out here that you
can refer to, and we

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:52.380 align:middle line:84%
can begin talking about other
things in complicated ways.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
75,000 years ago,

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
we developed this
subject-doing-object

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
relationship with this
symbolic language.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Once we did, then we had this
I The I's in there, planted.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The I is right
there, and the I's

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:84%
involved in everything that goes
on, common across our species.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Once we learned how to
do that, we kicked ass.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the other
four species, gone.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And we shouldn't have won.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
There were bigger, stronger,
bigger-brained species.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They should have beat us.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:90%
They didn't.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:90%
We wiped them off the surface--

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we
eventually came out of that.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And we said, we really are
going to control the package

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:90%
and we did.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
With that knowledge,
that symbolic logic,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and the structures,
the I structure,

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:84%
this piece of software-- that's
all it, a piece of software--

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
we wiped up the planet,
for good or bad.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:90%
And that now is our problem.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
We've got this egoic structure,
and you can see it everywhere

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:90%
you look.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a big ego sitting there.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And this ego is what's
running the process

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and screwing everything up.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We've lost ourselves
in objective experience.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
We have allowed ourselves
to become immersed

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
in and therefore,
apparently limited

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:84%
by our objective
experience to the extent

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that that's what
we think we are.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.090 align:middle line:84%
We think I am this bundle of
thoughts, images, feelings,

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:84%
memories, activities,
relationships.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people are so
involved in their experience

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:90%
that they don't notice.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
They overlook or forget
their essential self,

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and this overlooking
of ourselves,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:84%
this is the ignoring of
the essential element

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.447 align:middle line:90%
of our experience.

trying to put an
end to his suffering

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.150 align:middle line:84%
by seeking to change his
activities, relationships,

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, but to
investigate who he truly is.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.289 align:middle line:84%
And to begin with, that will
require some exploration.

may describe it differently, but
certainly, the sense of the ego

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:90%
self is definitely--

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.750 align:middle line:84%
you could call that
basic ignorance

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:39.610 align:middle line:84%
where we've created this
notion, this sense of self,

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
this sense of I, very deeply
conditioned, really deeply

habituated.

is to see that this
very notion is illusory,

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:84%
that there's a conventional
meaning to the sense of self

a use, but it also

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
has a danger because
as long as there's

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that view, then
what is it that we

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:90%
do around this sense of self?

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:90%
We try to gratify it.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:90%
We defend it.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.740 align:middle line:90%
We aggrandize it.

We do all kinds of things.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But meditation takes
us to a deeper level

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.900 align:middle line:84%
where we say, OK, what
is it that we're actually

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:90%
calling self?

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we look deeper, we
see the constituent elements

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:90%
that go in.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is just helpful
because then we're

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:84%
not so attached to this idea,
to this concept, of self.

there is a self-center
that we gravitate around--

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:84%
when we see through that,
then the natural expression

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:84%
of that insight is compassion,
is connection, is love.

James isn't a real thing.

there's a different
James who shows up

no, you haven't always

what they've called,
I, all their life.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:43.380 align:middle line:84%
The person may then refer
to some bodily sensation.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, I would point out that
our bodily sensations change

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.470 align:middle line:84%
innumerable times
throughout the day,

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.210 align:middle line:90%
let alone throughout our lives.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So no actual experience of the
body is inherent to begin with.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:84%
They would describe thoughts,
feelings, and activities,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.310 align:middle line:84%
but as the conversation
went on, there

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.180 align:middle line:84%
would be longer and
longer periods of silence

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:10.680 align:middle line:84%
as they tried to find something
in their own experience which

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:84%
they could say, this is
with me when I'm dreaming.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It's with me when
I'm deeply asleep.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It's with me
whatever I'm feeling.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It's with me at
whatever age I've been,

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.200 align:middle line:84%
in whatever circumstance
I find myself.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So they would begin to
struggle to put a name to that.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.800 align:middle line:84%
What is it in our experience
that qualifies as I?

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, no thought, no
feeling, no bodily sensation,

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.640 align:middle line:84%
no activity, no
relationship, qualifies as I

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:84%
because these are continually
leaving us and reappearing

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and leaving us.

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So the self-inquiry begins
with this tracing back

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.990 align:middle line:90%
of the attention.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not my thoughts.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I am that which is
aware of my thoughts.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.913 align:middle line:90%
I'm not my feelings.

00:43:59.913 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I am that which is
aware of my feelings.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
We trace our way back until we
get simply to that which I am.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:84%
The only element that
remains with us all the time

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:16.850 align:middle line:84%
is our essential being or our
essential self-aware being,

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and at some point, there
is this recognition,

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:90%
I am pure awareness.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.030 align:middle line:84%
That's just the recognition
of our true nature.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And we've lost
touch in most cases

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:34.190 align:middle line:84%
with our essential self which
is not a thought or a feeling,

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.690 align:middle line:84%
an activity, or
relationship, and is

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:41.000 align:middle line:84%
above all, inherently peaceful
and unconditionally fulfilled.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it is the place
in us of peace and happiness.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:49.490 align:middle line:84%
But most of us have overlooked
that or forgotten it

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:55.530 align:middle line:84%
in favor of the objective
content of our experience.

>> That's it.

If these kind of
thoughts are quiet,

and most people, 99%
of their thoughts

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.070 align:middle line:84%
are these kind of
thoughts, the bad thoughts,

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.440 align:middle line:84%

Do you know how you did it or--?

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I went into self-inquiry,
inquiring who you are and what

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:43.996 align:middle line:90%
you are, and it worked.

00:51:43.996 --> 00:51:45.950 align:middle line:90%
You watch your thoughts.

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:47.270 align:middle line:90%
You could watch your thoughts.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.860 align:middle line:84%
You could see all
that taking place.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.780 align:middle line:90%
They all had an I in them.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Part of this stuff that
I do, this practice,

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is getting rid of
your attachments

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:84%
because the attachments
really generate the I.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:90%
They work together.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.362 align:middle line:90%
I want this green tea.

00:52:01.362 --> 00:52:02.570 align:middle line:90%
I have to have the green tea.

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:05.300 align:middle line:84%
If I don't, oh my
gosh, it got terrible.

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So you just deconstruct
all those attachments.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that drives you
forward because as you

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:15.860 align:middle line:84%
start to take apart James,
you find a lot of resistance.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of James' stories
about this and that,

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of old memories,
a lot of old traumas,

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and there's ways to push through
those, to look at them and say,

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:middle line:90%
where's the James in this one?

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You look at your attachments
and what's attachment to that.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a James there attached
to the car or the reputation

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.870 align:middle line:84%
or the story or whatever,
and you say, well, those

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:37.490 align:middle line:90%
are all parts of James.

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.550 align:middle line:84%
You can break all
those down, but you've

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.172 align:middle line:84%
got to decide, hey,
this is serious.

00:52:43.172 --> 00:52:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't just buy another
car, get another girlfriend,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.850 align:middle line:90%
get more drugs, rock and roll.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I've got to somehow
fix this thing.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm responsible for this mess.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has to feel that.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.930 align:middle line:90%
And change.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:59.280 align:middle line:84%
If they don't change,
the ship sinks.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.210 align:middle line:90%

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Because that's an
important part.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:23.760 align:middle line:84%
When you get to that point, then
you'll do anything to get free.

00:53:31.987 --> 00:53:33.070 align:middle line:90%

>> I think I'm at that point.

>> How much are you
willing to surrender?

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.025 align:middle line:84%
Accept, let go,
are words we use,

00:54:04.025 --> 00:54:05.900 align:middle line:84%
but we don't like to
use the word, surrender.

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:09.456 align:middle line:84%

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I was totally held,
totally, completely.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I have no sense
of doing anything.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:31.650 align:middle line:90%


00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have to
understand it right now.

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:36.760 align:middle line:90%
That will come later.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.560 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.650 align:middle line:84%

right now, and my face,

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:46.050 align:middle line:90%
it's like really tingling.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:53.430 align:middle line:84%
It may not be the ideal
situation to do this in.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Don't do it if it's
not right for you,

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:59.145 align:middle line:84%
but see if you can allow
yourself to make some sound.

00:54:59.145 --> 00:55:03.340 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> [BREATHES OUT].

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's it.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult but
try not to control it.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, try and let the sound
out as much as you can.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And then tell me a little bit.

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:26.970 align:middle line:90%


00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.287 align:middle line:90%
>> It's something new for me.

00:55:28.287 --> 00:55:30.120 align:middle line:84%
We didn't learn about
this stuff growing up.

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't teach
this stuff at school.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.170 align:middle line:84%
This isn't what they taught
us at church and all that.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.870 align:middle line:90%
Its a different thing.

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I met a couple of
people on this trip

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.230 align:middle line:84%
in India, a teacher,
a guy in New York,

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:42.473 align:middle line:84%
and they said, by
learning these things,

00:55:42.473 --> 00:55:44.640 align:middle line:84%
learning how to be more
present and stuff like that,

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.080 align:middle line:84%
they actually don't
get angry, ever.

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.497 align:middle line:84%
They're not making
bad decisions.

00:55:50.497 --> 00:55:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a process.

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:52.770 align:middle line:90%
You're not born that way.

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No, definitely.

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe we
are born that way,

00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and then stuff happens in
our life which changes us.

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.448 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
born as little assholes.

00:56:00.448 --> 00:56:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's learned behavior.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You learn how to be an
asshole and then you

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.350 align:middle line:90%
learn, you unlearn, whatever.

00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was definitely
interesting, that's for sure.

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:11.740 align:middle line:90%
I went to Peru also.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.420 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
what I did in Peru?

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> No, tell me.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.110 align:middle line:84%
There's monks and
everything else, right?

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.485 align:middle line:84%
>> No, in Peru,
there's no monks.

00:56:17.485 --> 00:56:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Those are shamans.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.010 align:middle line:84%
We drank-- we went one
month in the jungle in Peru,

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:24.693 align:middle line:84%
and there's this stuff
called ayahuasca.

00:56:24.693 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard of that?

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.620 align:middle line:90%


00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They take this vine that
grows above ground like a vine,

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and they take a leaf
from another plant,

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.350 align:middle line:90%
and there's priests.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.317 align:middle line:84%
Then at night, you sit in
a room with 12 people--

00:56:38.317 --> 00:56:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> And you drink it?

00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And you drink it.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It was you.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.260 align:middle line:90%
They watch you.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No, 12-- everybody drinks it.

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, they're
experimenting on you.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, they weren't
experimenting on me.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.787 align:middle line:84%
It was crazy, but I
started to have that panic

00:56:48.787 --> 00:56:50.100 align:middle line:90%
attack before I drank it.

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I was like crying and shaking.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even drink
this stuff yet.

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:56.713 align:middle line:90%
And I drank it.

00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't have drank it.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.810 align:middle line:90%
I would have faked it.

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I would have been like, yeah--

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:02.710 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have drank it at all.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but I felt like
I was fighting this thing,

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and then the fourth
time I did it--

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.160 align:middle line:84%
we were there for like a
month, and I did it 5 times--

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>> You drank the
juice five times?

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.070 align:middle line:84%
But the fourth
time, I figured out

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:20.640 align:middle line:84%
that I was like fighting
this thing-- they call

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.250 align:middle line:84%
it a medicine-- they're
like doctors actually,

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is like
a natural medicine

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.780 align:middle line:90%
that God told them about.

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:28.770 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But some people leave with
no depression or anxiety,

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:35.430 align:middle line:84%
or some people are suicidal,
and they go, and it helps them.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:39.012 align:middle line:84%
It fixes-- it can help
people fix their problems,

00:57:39.012 --> 00:57:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and for me, I felt
it really helped

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:44.805 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like
a lot of the anxiety

00:57:44.805 --> 00:57:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I had because I feel I try
to control stuff to always

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.950 align:middle line:84%
be in control of everything
in my life, and with that kind

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:55.360 align:middle line:84%
of stuff, you can't
be in control.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard because you start
freaking out at the beginning

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.480 align:middle line:84%
because your body and your
mind and all that stuff,

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.250 align:middle line:90%
you just can't do anything.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:03.597 align:middle line:90%
You're totally out of control.

00:58:03.597 --> 00:58:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You're lucky you didn't piss
yourself in front of all those

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:06.980 align:middle line:90%
people.

from these teachers and these

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:22.120 align:middle line:84%
gurus and people that I
saw about how suffering is

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.210 align:middle line:84%
an illusion and that it
doesn't really exist,

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.590 align:middle line:84%
but I was still
feeling suffering.

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So I really wanted to
take ayahuasca and work

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:32.980 align:middle line:84%
with that medicine to
see if I could access

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:37.572 align:middle line:84%
that place in myself where the
suffering didn't exist anymore.

00:58:37.572 --> 00:58:40.550 align:middle line:90%

analyze your life,

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.240 align:middle line:84%
you start to question what

what is the nature of truth,
and it seems that there is more

than one answer
to that question.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.390 align:middle line:84%
This isn't all reality, then
who is it behind the eyes?

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:58.290 align:middle line:84%
When I think to myself,
who's I and who's myself?

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.140 align:middle line:84%
How can I have a simultaneous
subjective objective experience

Who's talking in there

>> Ayahuasca is an amazing
medicine that been known about

01:01:51.690 --> 01:02:02.070 align:middle line:84%
for centuries and brewed in the
Amazon by the combining of two

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.700 align:middle line:90%
elements.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.300 align:middle line:84%
What it is, is you
have the vine and then

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
you have the leaf,
so the combination

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
of the vine and
the leaf in a tea

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
allows the DMT to
become orally active.

DMT is one of the most powerful

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
In so many ways, we have become
dismembered, disconnected,

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
dislocated, dislodged,
as a result of trauma,

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
so now, we see in the West
that our medical system is not

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:49.420 align:middle line:84%
able to address the root
causes of the chronic issues

that we face typically on

So the epidemic of
depression, anxiety,

01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
stress that we see in the modern

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.130 align:middle line:90%

Ayahuasca and the tradition
that surrounds ayahuasca

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%

the root causes of
stress, depression,

the barriers, the blockages,

ourselves being able to live
in a much more authentic way,

01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:30.820 align:middle line:84%
feeling a sense of
presence, feeling

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
a sense of coherence, of flow,
and connection in our life.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So ayahuasca, in a
nutshell, is really

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
helping us to
remember who we are.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
We forget who we
are because we get

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:46.570 align:middle line:84%
too trapped in the conditions
and patterns and programs that

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:50.170 align:middle line:84%
have been laid in, often in our
childhood, that take us away

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.357 align:middle line:90%
from presence and authenticity.

01:05:53.357 --> 01:06:48.040 align:middle line:90%


01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody should be going into
this sacred experience with

01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.050 align:middle line:90%
a view to recreation.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.680 align:middle line:90%
This is not what it's about.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that at all.

01:06:56.570 --> 01:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about deep, often very
troubling, personal work.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're prepared to do that
work, it can be transformatory.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.400 align:middle line:90%


01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
What ayahuasca is
going to show you

01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
is the plain, unvarnished truth
about yourself and the impact,

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
either positive or
negative or a bit of both,

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%
that you have in the world.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.447 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get that
message loud and clear,

01:07:22.447 --> 01:07:24.780 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later, maybe not
your first session, maybe not

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
your 10th, but
sooner or later, it

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.395 align:middle line:84%
is going to hit
you like a rocket.

01:07:28.395 --> 01:07:36.670 align:middle line:90%


01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> When you have a really
powerful ayahuasca experience,

01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
it's like the rapids that you're
going down in your imagination.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
One dimension after
another is coming at you,

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.250 align:middle line:90%
and it's just overwhelming.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that
you can control it.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the best is
to surrender to it

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and to orient toward your
most deep center of your soul.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.720 align:middle line:90%

That's it.

01:09:50.821 --> 01:09:52.279 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
out on a limb here.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing there's a little
bit of control going on there.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.851 align:middle line:90%
Does not make any sense?

01:09:59.851 --> 01:10:01.910 align:middle line:90%

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry, what?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:05.625 align:middle line:90%
OK.

>> I feel more emotions come up.

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, just let them be there.

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Just allow them space.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.680 align:middle line:90%

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:59.885 align:middle line:84%
See, I may not be right,
but I have a slight feeling

01:10:59.885 --> 01:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that there's
something that wants

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to put that screen to sleep,
shut it up, not be so noisy.

It was the first time in my life
that I ever tried ayahuasca,

and yeah, it was a
pretty intense place

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:54.820 align:middle line:90%
to go for the first round.

01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And the first night,
I was kind of mellow,

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't really have
much of an experience,

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:03.370 align:middle line:84%
so the second night,
I drank much more.

01:19:03.370 --> 01:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And before I even
drank the medicine,

01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I was having crazy anxiety
attacks before I even

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.480 align:middle line:90%
drank it, just pure panic.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And then I realized something.

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was trying
to control something.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
control the medicine,

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't really
willing to let go.

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And I had this thought of
like, what the fuck am I doing?

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm here in Peru in the
jungle drinking ayahuasca,

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to control
something that can't really

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.263 align:middle line:90%
be controlled.

01:19:31.263 --> 01:19:33.790 align:middle line:90%


01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:36.370 align:middle line:90%
And then I completely let go.

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, great insight.

01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.930 align:middle line:90%
And everything changed.

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I even
let go of life.

01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember having a thought
of, well, if this is death

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:49.185 align:middle line:84%
or I'm dying right now,
I'm OK with it, which

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is something that
was huge for me

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.185 align:middle line:84%
because I always had
this fear of dying

01:19:52.185 --> 01:19:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and felt like I actually
did die on some level.

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> But it was OK.

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like [EXHALES].

>> But you had reached that
point of surrendering even

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and that is beyond your control,
letting die the controller

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and getting in touch with
the great controller.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%

in my life from anxiety.

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it coming, and then
I do the same kind of thing

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.280 align:middle line:84%
where I start to
control, try to control.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what's happening?

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:36.560 align:middle line:90%
What's that feeling?

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.330 align:middle line:90%
What's coming up in me?

01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, what you just
said makes a lot of sense.

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I have to maybe treat it
like I did with the ayahuasca

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and somehow completely
surrender to the feelings

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that I have instead of trying
to control them, maybe.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%

you surrendered, right?

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:38.390 align:middle line:90%
dealing with a gigantic mystery.

01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
What we're here to do,
as best as we possibly

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
can in one lifetime or
in multiple lifetimes,

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
is to explore that mystery and
understand, try to understand,

01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
what all this magic is
about because surely,

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:59.120 align:middle line:84%
it's a magical thing,
an enchanted thing

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to live in this universe, to
live on this beautiful planet.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Where I see the light is an
awakening of consciousness,

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that people all around
the world are waking up

01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to this fundamental fact
that we are not our knees,

01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
we are not our shoulders,
we are not our skulls,

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.620 align:middle line:90%
we are our consciousness.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.150 align:middle line:90%


01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The most transforming effect
of this recognition is that it

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
puts us in touch with the place
of happiness in ourselves,

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and it brings an end to the
impossible and unfulfillable

01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
search for happiness in
objective experience.

01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even mean to
say that we necessarily

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:46.860 align:middle line:84%
stopped desiring activities
and relationships

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
but we desire them not in order
to find happiness in them,

01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
we desire them in order to
express or celebrate or share

01:22:56.090 --> 01:23:04.127 align:middle line:84%
the happiness or the peace
that we have already felt.

01:23:04.127 --> 01:23:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I've never done psychedelics.

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.773 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a psychedelic virgin.

01:23:07.773 --> 01:23:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
change that right now.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
some LSD in there.

01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody I work with
has done everything.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the only virgin,
but yeah, I just

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
was trying to find
some way through.

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So through meditation,
through practicing yoga--

01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm just interested to
know the different methods

01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:31.410 align:middle line:84%
that you used to
end the suffering.

01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But the core of
it is just this,

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.320 align:middle line:90%
how do we deconstruct this I?

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
When you completely
surrender, it happens.

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:49.520 align:middle line:90%


01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> God, how many people
I think are even aware--

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It is possible.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> --of what this thing is that
they could actually have access

01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:58.330 align:middle line:90%
to.

01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:00.690 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's felt it.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
There's something in
our life, everybody's

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.430 align:middle line:90%
at someplace had a--

01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:07.480 align:middle line:90%
oh, wow.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.200 align:middle line:90%


01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.820 align:middle line:90%
It goes away there.

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't caused by
an orgasm or something

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that-- just had a little
window into some other space.

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:19.810 align:middle line:90%
It was like, what is that?

01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And quickly, the brain,
conditioned very heavily,

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.080 align:middle line:90%
plasters it over.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, pay no attention to
the man behind the screen.

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just get
it out of the way.

01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you recognize, you can
have that, that little window

01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that you had, that little,
oh wow, what is that?

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.270 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You can be in this blissful,
transcendent, OMG state

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:49.930 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:51.120 align:middle line:90%
You can just be there.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Life still goes on.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
These bodies still have
behaviors that they do.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what's
inside is vast stillness.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.790 align:middle line:84%
You still pick up
coffee and tea,

01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and move it around the
table and everything else.

01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what's
happening inside

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.700 align:middle line:90%
isn't anything to do with that.

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The body still does
what bodies do.

01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, you've
moved far beyond that.

01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
You can see that all
of this is a dream.

01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:22.690 align:middle line:90%
None of this is real.

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:27.310 align:middle line:84%
You're in a whole
different place.

01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:29.400 align:middle line:90%
You're not there anymore.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're in now, now,
now, to really just be there.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:38.320 align:middle line:90%
There is no past, literally.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.080 align:middle line:90%


01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no recollection of
what took place 10 seconds ago.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:52.552 align:middle line:84%
There's just now and
now and now and now.

01:25:52.552 --> 01:25:53.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole different world.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:26:09.450 align:middle line:90%


01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:11.580 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:26:11.580 --> 01:27:11.990 align:middle line:90%


01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:19.350 align:middle line:84%
You feel bliss because the
bliss pass through you.

01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:28.817 align:middle line:90%


01:27:28.817 --> 01:27:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The path, in the sense that
I'm on, is trying to figure out

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.930 align:middle line:84%
how to quiet my mind and not
be controlled by thoughts,

01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:40.020 align:middle line:84%
not let my emotions control
me, be who I really am,

01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and not pretend to
be somebody else.

01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:45.092 align:middle line:84%
When we're kids, we
have to be a certain way

01:27:45.092 --> 01:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
so that our teachers like
us, so that our parents are

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:50.595 align:middle line:84%
happy with us, so that
the society works,

01:27:50.595 --> 01:27:51.470 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-Hmm.

01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We can't actually
be ourselves.

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So we pretend to be
something else that we think

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.150 align:middle line:90%
everybody else wants us to be.

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:02.292 align:middle line:84%
And just that idea in
itself causes us to suffer,

01:28:02.292 --> 01:28:03.500 align:middle line:90%
and we don't even realize it.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It causes us from reaching
our full potential,

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:08.030 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
learned traveling

01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
around the world talking to
all these amazing people,

01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:17.270 align:middle line:84%
smart people, scientists,
people every different religion,

01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the way to kind of
fix all this stuff

01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
is to really just be in
the moment, to be present.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.732 align:middle line:90%


01:28:27.732 --> 01:28:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's the
bottom line, I guess.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bottom line type of guy.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If you'll try it,
I'll give you some CDs.

01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:36.910 align:middle line:90%
You can listen to and see.

01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:39.383 align:middle line:84%
If you say you're present
all the time anyway,

01:28:39.383 --> 01:28:40.300 align:middle line:90%
it'll be easy for you.

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Just kick it on--

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I'm present
when it's important.

01:28:42.565 --> 01:28:44.050 align:middle line:84%
When it's important,
I'm present.

01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> What's not important?

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm here.

01:28:46.915 --> 01:28:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm here visiting with you.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.140 align:middle line:84%
That's important for me to
be in the moment, right?

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, also, I didn't
realize how important life is.

01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.170 align:middle line:90%
It goes by quick.

01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, goes by quick, real quick.

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But you said like, being
present when things are

01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:04.190 align:middle line:90%
important.

01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is,
what's not important?

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, some things
are not important.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is important.

01:29:09.045 --> 01:29:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Every minute is like a gift.

01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:16.358 align:middle line:84%
You figure it out, carve your
little circle out, and do you.

01:29:16.358 --> 01:29:18.400 align:middle line:84%
What you can never change
what other people think

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.125 align:middle line:90%
or act or feel, that's for sure.

01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't want to do that.

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.583 align:middle line:84%
>> I stopped watching the
news and reading the newspaper

01:29:24.583 --> 01:29:27.670 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago because
you can't change the news,

01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:30.640 align:middle line:90%
but the news can change you.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Nothing you can do about what's
happening on the 8 o'clock

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:38.880 align:middle line:84%
news, but I'd better
get out of here.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.760 align:middle line:90%
They're going to--

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to go to
the jazz place later?

01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, for sure.

01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>> They got some jazz--

01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Jazz out.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --ginger ale.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Cranberry, bro.

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Cranberry juice.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I live it up.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.870 align:middle line:84%
At night, cranberry and
pineapple something.

01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a drink
so you could perpetrate

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.405 align:middle line:90%
with the pineapple juice.

01:29:59.405 --> 01:30:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I'd say,
give me a umbrella.

01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:05.760 align:middle line:90%


01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.974 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:30:07.974 --> 01:30:08.970 align:middle line:90%
You got to eat, bro.

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:10.680 align:middle line:90%
You need a big steak.

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Stop messing around, eat a
big steak, get it over with.

01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:15.378 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not going eat a steak.

01:30:15.378 --> 01:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I get the vegan
thing for a month.

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I've been doing
it for like eight years.

01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Get down with a steak.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Big Texas cattleman.

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You tried the
vegetarian thing too--

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know.
