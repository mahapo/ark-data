Not so much of my lower body.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:90%
It was more like the top.

this ringing, a really loud,

intense roar and ringing.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%

>> What we see when we
study subjects that are able

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
a very high increment
of the gamma waves.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So we see a peak of 200
hertz in the gamma band wave.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's very peculiar.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:90%
That's unheard of.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that is common.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:10%
And so what we see is
that, for a few seconds,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:10%
we see the subject
reaching up to 200 hertz.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And normally what
we see, for example,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:10%
when studies about
meditation, we

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:10%
see that meditators, different
types of meditation technique

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:10%
will induce 70, 80,
60 hertz per second.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:90%
But not that high.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I just found myself
out of the body,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:90%
just going up and up and up.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was no sort of
violent exiting process.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It was just this beautiful lift.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.443 align:middle line:90%
yeah, wow, just going with it.

00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the first
time I got outside,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I was just completely in
awe that I was flying down

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:90%
the road.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're on the physical
plane, it's mind-blowing.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But then when you're on the
astral planes, the colors

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:90%
and the expansiveness.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Astral projection
is an esoteric term.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:10%
It goes back to probably
the occult literature

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:10%
from the 19th
century and before.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And it essentially
references the idea

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
of an astral body, which was
popularized by the Theosophical

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.348 align:middle line:90%
Society.

00:04:28.348 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
It had an essential
idea that there's

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
an etheric body, an astral
body, and multiple other bodies.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But actually, in the science,
we find that only about 30%

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:84%
of people actually experience
any kind of energy body

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.552 align:middle line:84%
while they're having an
out-of-body experience.

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember that the very
first point when I looked

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
at my hand and I saw that I
wasn't this physical body.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was physically
outside of it.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, my
senses are superhuman.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
They're not infinite, but
they're so much better.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:90%
I can see for absolute miles.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.222 align:middle line:90%
I can zoom in to string level.

00:05:08.222 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:90%
At least that's how it feels.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I can see everything in my
room exactly the way it was.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:10%
I can see myself
breathing, sleeping,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:10%
in the exact same
position that I was.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
back to my body, I

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:90%
woke up in that same position.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that was.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was more vivid
than just a dream.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I
actually left myself,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and I was on top of
myself, floating, watching

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:90%
myself sleep.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> When I spoke to my
teacher, Lama Yeshe Rinpoche,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.540 align:middle line:84%
about the differences between
lucid dreaming and out-of-body

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
experience, he said,
"Lucid dream in head.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Now you go out of head.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:90%
This is the point."

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The difference between lucid
dreaming and out-of-the-body

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:10%
experience, for me, mainly
is the shaking of the body.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:10%
They also can happen
when you are awake.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> If you've only had a
few lucid dreams and a few

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences, they
can seem confusingly similar.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But there are absolutely
100% lucid dreams and 100%

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
out-of-body experiences.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:10%
But there is also a third
category of something

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:10%
where you're in the lucid
dream and then can exit

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:10%
into an out-of-body experience.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And even an out-of-body
experience then drops back down

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:90%
into a lucid dream.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You can project
out of your body.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But you could then
lose it, and then you

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:90%
end up in a lucid dream.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:90%
You can go through all stages.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's all mixed up.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So you go through normal to wake
to dream, and it's all muddled,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and it's all a bit in between.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> My kind of reality test
for that is if I try to change

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
my body, to see if I say, OK,
if I'm dressed now in blue

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, purple--

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:90%
if it changes, I'm dreaming.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.597 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't change, it's an
out-of-the-body experience.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> My wife summed this
up perfectly, actually.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
She said that a lucid dream
is like gaining access

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:90%
to the files in your laptop.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You have access to the files, to
the photos, to the hard drive.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.067 align:middle line:84%
That's like having access
to your internal psychology,

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:90%
just as you do in a lucid dream.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But in an out-of-body
experience,

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
you use the laptop to
access the World Wide Web,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
to access the internet, where
you have not only access

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
to your own internal files,
your own internal psychology,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
but actually to the huge,
collective psychology,

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:90%
the universal mind itself.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And I suspect
what's taking place--

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland in the
brain, this tiny little object

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
brain, is generating

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in some way substances
that actually

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
alter our states
of consciousness,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
seem to open our
doors of perception

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.535 align:middle line:84%

and it's called the
metachoric model.

00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that
we carry a model

of reality inside our heads.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%

But it doesn't mean that
model of reality isn't real.

Because it is the imagination,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%

the G Technique,

that I use to induce

an out-of-body experience.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I went into a very deep
trance, probably the deepest

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I've ever experienced, or
definitely one of the deepest.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%

on the corner of Moore Street

and Old Compton Street
in central London.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking down
on Compton Street,

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.713 align:middle line:84%
and I saw an explosion burst
out from the right-hand side

00:10:58.713 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:90%
of the street.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw the sort
of chaos ensue as people

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:90%
realized what had happened.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt this strong,
emotional sort of energy

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:90%
hit me in the chest.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And I came back to my body.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But I was still in this quite
deep void, trance-like state.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed in that state until
one of the other people that

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
was there with me sort of coaxed
me out of this deep trance.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I described
to them what

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen, that I'd seen
this bombing in Soho.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And I had this strong
conviction that I

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:90%
felt that it was precognitive.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And essentially five
days later, there

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
was a bombing in that
location, as I'd seen it

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:90%

out-of-body experience we

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:84%
don't perceive space and

And the underworlds are
all the pieces of your mind

that are lost in dreams,
in traumatic experiences

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:90%
like that.

>> So within Tibetan Buddhism,
out-of-body experience practice

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
is used primarily as a
training for death and dying.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you're having a
rehearsal for that separation

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:84%
of the energy body from
the physical body, which

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what will happen
in the death and dying states.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Within Tibetan Buddhism,
out-of-body experience

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.567 align:middle line:84%
is known as special
dream body practice.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is confusing
because they're

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:90%
using the term dream body here.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
But what we need
to understand is

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that, within the Tibetan
Buddhist belief system,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
there is the secondary dream
that we have at nighttime.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But there is also the primary
dream of waking existence,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:84%
because this experience
of everyday reality

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:90%
is not seen as full reality.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It is seen like a
dream-like illusion that we

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
are co-creating into existence,
and a dream in which we are not

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.222 align:middle line:90%
fully awake and aware.

00:17:32.222 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Through the practice of
out-of-body experience,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
we can become more awake
in the shared dream.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I can recall a few where
people actually contacted

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.235 align:middle line:84%
and had direct contact
with dead loved ones.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And they communicated with
them directly, and not

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:84%
just through using
a trance medium

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of channeling.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're not talking
about any intermediary.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a face-to-face
conversation

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
with a loved one like a father
or a mother that's passed.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most life-changing
OBEs I ever had was when I met

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.785 align:middle line:90%
my dad after he died.

00:18:23.785 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of
guilt surrounding it

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:90%
and the things that I had done.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.655 align:middle line:84%
It was just the
most awful feeling.

00:18:29.655 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And about 90 days
after he died, I

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:90%
had an out-of-body experience.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I went specifically
to look for him.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
When I came back
from that, that guilt

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
just lifted, which was really
something I had no control

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:90%
over.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:84%
My logical brain was
trying to work out

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
whether that was
even really him,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
how much can I trust
this experience.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It was doing all the
logical brain things.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But my actual physiology
just totally changed.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:84%
That heavy, horrible
guilt just went.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Some out-of-body experiences
can occur spontaneously

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
in extreme situations such
as pregnancy and labor,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
intense panic attacks, and
near-death experiences.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
In 2016, the world's largest
medical near-death study

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:84%
was led by Dr. Sam Parnia from
New York University's Langone

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Institute for Medicine.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
He looked at 2,060
cardiac arrests

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and found that, in many cases,
consciousness can remain active

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:90%
after someone flatlines.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
This challenges
perceived notions

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
around the clinical
timing of death

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.165 align:middle line:84%
and raises questions about the
nature of consciousness itself.

00:20:09.165 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I caught up with
"New York Times"

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
best-selling author Eben
Alexander, a neurosurgeon

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
who had a near-death
experience that

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:90%
dramatically changed his life.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a severe case of
bacterial meningoencephalitis.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:84%
The human part of my
brain, the entire surface,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:84%
was attacked and heavily damaged
by a primitive bacterium that

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
should have killed me,
certainly should have gotten rid

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
of anything but
the most primitive

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:90%
of conscious experiences.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet, as I went
through that weeklong coma

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
due to meningitis and
destruction of the cortex,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I actually experienced a far
greater kind of awareness

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:90%
and conscious experience.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The near-death experience is
when someone survives a close

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.720 align:middle line:84%
brush with death, and they
experience a set of components

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It might start with the
out-of-body experience

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
where they may leave their body
and look down at the emergency

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:90%
situation from above.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They may describe going
through a dark tunnel

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:90%
towards a bright light.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And they feel very drawn
towards that light,

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.855 align:middle line:84%
almost like it's got
a magnetic quality.

00:21:23.855 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Once they're in the light,
they can find themselves

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
in beautiful surroundings
with lush, green grass,

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:90%
vividly-colored flowers.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a stream
in the background.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they often
meet deceased relatives

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:39.950 align:middle line:90%
or friends.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they meet a religious
figure which is usually

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:90%
associated with their culture.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:10%
They may also meet
just a being of light

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:10%
or sense a presence around them.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I experienced multiple
different realms.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It began in an earthworms-eye
view, a very primitive,

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:90%
coarse, unresponsive realm.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But all of that shifted
very dramatically

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
when I was ushered
up through a portal,

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:84%
through a circle of
light, a melody of sound,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.510 align:middle line:84%
into a brilliant, ultra-real
valley, the gateway valley.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of earthly features, but
it was like a world of ideals.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Everything was perfect.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And encountering higher
souls and guardian angels,

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:84%
all that was perfectly
real in that realm.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to see if the
near-death experience was just

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
some form of hallucination as
the brain was shutting down.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
What I kind of found
with my research

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
is that some people
gained information,

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
in ways other than
through the senses,

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
previously aware of.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the patients
in my study, he

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:84%
met one of his
deceased relatives.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And as part of his
near-death experience,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:90%
she gave him a message.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.275 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you've
got to go back to life.

00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back, tell
this relative this message.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So when he did revive,
he gave this message

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:90%
to the living relative.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And she was absolutely
astounded that he

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:90%
should know that information.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, as a conventional
neuroscientist,

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
that absolutely demanded
some explanation because it

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
completely defied everything
that modern neuroscience thinks

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:84%
it knows about the
neocortex, and the brain,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship
to consciousness.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think the near-death
experience is a brain

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:10%
I think it's wider than that.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I think what
happens is the brain

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
in some way is compromised,
either through fear

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
or through damage, and during
that the image of the body

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:84%
somehow deteriorates within the
brain and this new form arises.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:10%
>> People tend to lose fear
of death after near-death

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.322 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:24:12.322 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:10%
And I think fear
of death in itself

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:10%
is extremely transformational.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Once you lose fear
of death, everything

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:90%
changes in your life.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> No fear of death.

you're leaving behind.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.003 align:middle line:90%

your soul, you can

differences, however.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
DMT experiences
often are concurrent

with geometric patterns
or the encounters

get on out-of-body experiences.

It can help us,
perhaps though, try

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:10%
and explain
out-of-body experiences

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:10%
because DMT is naturally
occurring in the human body.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's not a
1-to-1 relationship

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:90%
between the two experiences.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
the idea that our perceptions
only give us a very small part

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, with
mind-altering substances--

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
dimethyltryptamine, for
instance, as an example--

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
suddenly it broadens out,
and the doors of perception

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:90%
are opened.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly our
perceptions are much wider.

I had become a point

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And on the journey
back, I came back

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and I could see these
strange creatures.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:10%
And then I realized I was
looking at myself and my friend

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:10%
on the floor.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.285 align:middle line:10%
For me, it was deeply profound.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.480 align:middle line:10%
I'd say that experience
has influenced my thinking

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.680 align:middle line:10%
about the nature of reality
in that I'm certainly

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:10%
very open to the idea
that consciousness is

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.100 align:middle line:10%
a separate entity to the body.

>> In 2002, when a
neuroscientist called Olaf

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Blanke was operating on
an epileptic patient,

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.158 align:middle line:84%
with electrodes
all over the brain,

00:28:53.158 --> 00:28:54.825 align:middle line:84%
and he could stimulate
different places.

00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:10%
And he discovered
that if he stimulated

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:10%
a spot on the right
temporoparietal junction,

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.460 align:middle line:10%
he could produce bodily
distortions or, at the extreme,

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:10%
a complete out-of-body
experience.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So we know that that spot,
disturbed, can produce

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Those studies that have
tried to induce out-of-body

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:84%
experience through electric
stimulation or neuromodulation,

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.320 align:middle line:90%
they are very interesting.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But the question is
does that mimic, really,

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:90%
the real experience or not?

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are stimulating
areas of the brain associated

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
with smell, the person
is, for example,

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:84%
perceiving the smell
of a strawberry.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.770 align:middle line:84%
The aroma of the strawberry
is not there present.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But the person can record,
and can even smell,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
or have the impression
of the smell.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The area of the brain
that is stimulating produces

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:84%
an experience that's not
very consistent with the type

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:84%
of experiences people have,
what I would consider a genuine

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.540 align:middle line:90%
out-of-body experience.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So a sense of moving
over a distance,

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:84%
going to another location,
perceiving things accurately

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.060 align:middle line:90%
that are happening around them--

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
things like that don't
happen in these kinds

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of induced experiences using the
TPJ, temporoparietal junction.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> There are places you can
stimulate the brain to mimic

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:40.490 align:middle line:84%
certain experiences, but
one should not be confused

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.170 align:middle line:84%
by thinking that those kinds
of tricks and various ways

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
of demonstrating relationships
between some types

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
of electrical or magnetic
stimulation and phenomenal

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
experience, that you can
then assume, oh, well,

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:90%
that's the cause of all of them.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the biggest mistakes.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So the types of things
that happen are not really

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.400 align:middle line:84%
consistent with an
out-of-body experience,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially what I
think many of the skeptics do.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
They use this what
I would consider

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:84%
overly broad definition,
which then means

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that you could pretty
much define anything

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:90%
as an out-of-body experience.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> How real is this phenomena
that is induced by this

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.898 align:middle line:90%
electric stimulation?

00:31:21.898 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you can say
that you are just

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:84%
stimulating the impression of
it, not the real phenomena.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
That is what we would
think is related

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.522 align:middle line:90%
to out-of-body experience.

00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think the experiences
are caused by neurological

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I think they happen at a
level beyond the brain.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.263 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.263 --> 00:31:45.055 align:middle line:84%
If there are any brain
changes, any changes

00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to neurological activity,
they are produced

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.045 align:middle line:90%
by the change in consciousness.

is that it's not created

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:84%
by the brain, that the
brain acts as a filter.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very important.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I've now seen many, many
people with very wide states

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:16.880 align:middle line:84%
You just cannot explain this
on a simple neurophysiological

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:90%
principle.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
a heightened state
of consciousness,

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
which really contradicts
our understanding,

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:84%
or the current materialist
perspective that the brain

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.550 align:middle line:90%
produces consciousness.

brain is disturbed somehow.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:90%
But the brain isn't functioning.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, it is, they say.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Little bit just around the back.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Rubbish.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.624 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:53.624 --> 00:32:56.040 align:middle line:84%
To get these very
wide experiences,

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to have many areas of
the brain functioning properly

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:90%
or it's somewhere else.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.580 align:middle line:90%
And I think it somewhere else.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness
is a fundamental,

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
universal quality which is
everywhere and in everything.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But there is also our own
individual consciousness,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.980 align:middle line:84%
which can't be separated from
fundamental consciousness

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
because our own individual
consciousness is

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.508 align:middle line:84%
an influx, you could say, of
fundamental consciousness.

00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:26.320 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> The body is an avatar.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.295 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is the player.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:39.340 align:middle line:84%
If you play the Sims game,
you make all the choices

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.885 align:middle line:84%
and decisions for
the Sims character.

00:33:41.885 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The Sims character is
just a computed shape,

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:90%
a computed form.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.420 align:middle line:10%
It's just information,
just like in our reality.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.050 align:middle line:10%
So that gets us to the
point of understanding

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness
is not in the body.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.335 align:middle line:10%
It's separate from the body.

00:33:59.335 --> 00:34:00.135 align:middle line:10%
It's the player.

00:34:00.135 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We normally
think of the self,

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.690 align:middle line:84%

self is a me in here,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.975 align:middle line:84%
That is just not
on, given everything

00:34:16.975 --> 00:34:19.350 align:middle line:84%
we know about the brain, the
way the visual system works,

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:84%
There can't be
somebody in there.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.409 align:middle line:84%
There's no center for the
brain where we can be,

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.100 align:middle line:90%
and so on, and so on.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There isn't anything
out there, or in here.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:90%
This is the confusion.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.719 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same thing.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And what we think
is physical matter

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.557 align:middle line:84%
is actually created by the
mind, by consciousness.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think the main role
of the brain is not to produce

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, but to canalize
or transmit fundamental

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
consciousness into
our individual being.

don't want to know.

>> There's three reasons why
they don't get taken seriously

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:90%
enough.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:28.900 align:middle line:84%
One is they're still
relatively rare experiences.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't sometimes see.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I see whenever I open
my eyes, thank goodness.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But I only sometimes
have those experiences.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.880 align:middle line:84%
They're on the cutting
edge of where we're going.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.410 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a new possibility
that hasn't really--

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.700 align:middle line:84%
some people better than
others, all that stuff.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the first reason.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
The second reason is
science only looks

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:90%
at the sensual world.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So it says that doesn't
exist, or that's just

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:90%
an illusion or a byproduct.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So it dismisses
it theoretically,

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and therefore it doesn't want
to look at it, which is a shame.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the odd things are
where the new understanding

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.920 align:middle line:90%
will come from.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing is,
in the causal world,

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:84%
the material world, you can
reproduce things, generally.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:84%
The more complicated it is,
the harder is to reproduce it.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.367 align:middle line:84%
So experiences like
telepathy happen in a story.

00:36:20.367 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:84%
They happen because something
occurred for my loved one.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't make
that happen in a lab.

I was extremely
peaceful about it

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And then that's happened
on every level--

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:84%
physical individuation,
bio-logical individuation

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.450 align:middle line:84%
into species, and then
soul individuation

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:90%
into individual souls.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very high
level of individuation,

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.980 align:middle line:84%
which is why, when
you meet people,

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.970 align:middle line:90%
they're really themselves.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:90%
We're all different.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that has allowed
us to become more and more

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:84%
conscious, to the point
where we can now be conscious

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:90%
that we are conscious.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Things evolve
to be efficient.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Things don't evolve to be
inefficient and wasteful.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, that's
the key idea in evolution,

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
is that things change, and the
things that are inefficient

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.510 align:middle line:90%
go away.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> As we enter an age where
artificial intelligence is

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.930 align:middle line:84%
swiftly moving beyond the
confines of the simple computer

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and machine, perhaps we're
also entering an age where

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.060 align:middle line:84%
consciousness will move beyond
the confines of the human body.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:90%


00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The most common after effects
of out-of-body experiences seem

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:84%
to be very positive and very
similar to that of some kinds

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.650 align:middle line:90%
of mystical experiences.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.050 align:middle line:84%
They become less
afraid of death,

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:15.720 align:middle line:84%
less concerned about material
goods and having stuff,

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and more interested in other
people and relationships.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.633 align:middle line:10%
>> Directly after
that experience,

00:42:24.633 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:10%
I remember running down the
stairs with this massive smile

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:31.880 align:middle line:10%
on my face, like
I'd met God, yeah?

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Just fearless, just kind of
like I'd had this epiphany of I

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.290 align:middle line:84%
can do anything I
want with my life.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Before, I would say that
I was pretty much scared.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:10%
So I feel a lot braver now.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.890 align:middle line:10%
And also, I think before
my experiences I would get

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:10%
stressed quite quickly or
I could snap quite quickly,

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.845 align:middle line:10%
whereas now I definitely
feel I'm a lot more chilled.

00:42:55.845 --> 00:42:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The most common one that
people describe to me would

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:07.035 align:middle line:84%
probably be some loss of
fear in different forms.

00:43:07.035 --> 00:43:10.510 align:middle line:90%


00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's in fear
of the unknown, fear

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of what an out-of-body
experience could be.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.480 align:middle line:84%
It might be in a very
basic level like that.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But at another time,
it might literally

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.520 align:middle line:84%
be that they're not so
fearful of literally going out

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.320 align:middle line:90%
of the house.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Or they're not so
focused on the fear

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that the television and the
news and all of that creates.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.800 align:middle line:84%
They kind of seem to reach
this point where that

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.540 align:middle line:90%
becomes less important to them.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I just became much
bolder and more daring.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I just learned
this big, obvious truth, which

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.870 align:middle line:84%
is that there's nothing
to fear but fear itself.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was
life-changing, basically.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I was always
terrified of education.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that, again, being
on this spiritual path which

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.290 align:middle line:84%
the OBEs have
ultimately led me to has

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.740 align:middle line:84%
helped me walk in
faith, where, before,

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.940 align:middle line:90%
that I was walking in fear.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to also be used
as a way to kind of lessen

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:17.020 align:middle line:84%
ego-clinging because if you can
have an experience of shifting

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.910 align:middle line:84%
out of this gross
corporeal form,

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
seeing that you're more than
your physical body, you also,

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.190 align:middle line:84%
in some way, see that you're
more than your ego mind,

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:27.035 align:middle line:84%
or the egocentric mind
that is so heavily attached

00:44:27.035 --> 00:44:27.910 align:middle line:90%
to the physical form.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They help you understand that
life isn't just getting through

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:90%
this physical process.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not just getting
up, going to work,

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:84%
coming home, watching TV,
getting something to eat.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.700 align:middle line:10%
It's not that treadmill.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I see myself building
a foundation for people.

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I have something called
CYF, Creating Young Futures.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a branch of education where
people could come and explore

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:90%
their own uniqueness.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:04.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's just changed the way
I want to impact the world.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:90%


00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> For many people, the
transformative effects

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.800 align:middle line:84%
of out-of-body experiences
seem to come through a visceral

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:90%
experience of awe.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.680 align:middle line:84%
In 2003, psychologists
Haidt and Keltner

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.870 align:middle line:84%
published a landmark
scientific study

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.900 align:middle line:84%
on the social and
emotional functions of awe.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.380 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.930 align:middle line:84%
They said that it
appeared to increase

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:39.990 align:middle line:84%
people's feelings of
connectedness and willingness

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to help others, and
that moments of awe

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:47.280 align:middle line:84%
could be one of the most swift,
powerful, and permanent ways

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.330 align:middle line:90%
to personal change.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people find that
they become more tolerant

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:84%
of other people as well, and
more compassionate, and caring,

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.125 align:middle line:84%
and loving towards
other peoples.

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I care more for animals.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I've become a vegan, which
I never thought I'd say.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But I've got in touch with
this emotional side of myself.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Even find myself--

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I cried at "Planet
of the Apes," right?

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I swear.

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like,
what's going on?

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:25.410 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to me?

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the area that
may have changed the most.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Relationships have been
a real transformative

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and emerging learning
curve and experience.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Emotionally, I've
become very, I'd say,

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.015 align:middle line:84%
more caring and more loving,
more motivated to become

00:46:45.015 --> 00:46:46.140 align:middle line:90%
the best version of myself.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people have horrible,
terrifying out-of-body

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty uncommon,
maybe 5% of all of them.

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.020 align:middle line:84%
That can have unpleasant
after effects.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.918 align:middle line:84%
But the vast majority of
effects are very positive.

00:47:03.918 --> 00:47:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was even questioning,
maybe I've lost my mind.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was some
type of psychosis.

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honestly,
it could have been.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:14.285 align:middle line:84%
But it was too vivid and too
real of an experience for me

00:47:14.285 --> 00:47:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to say that,
because I would have

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.480 align:middle line:84%
had reoccurring experiences
like that in my mind

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.230 align:middle line:90%
again if that was the case.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What you find in an
out-of-body state has a lot

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to do with what you
bring to that state--

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.470 align:middle line:84%
the state of your
mind, your attitude,

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:32.730 align:middle line:84%
what you know, what you
don't know, your beliefs.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.965 align:middle line:84%
>> People that astral
project, like yourself--

00:47:35.965 --> 00:47:37.590 align:middle line:84%
if I look at you, I
look at the people.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:41.100 align:middle line:84%
You are brave because
it's terrifying at first.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:41.900 align:middle line:90%
It's terrifying.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But once you get past
that, you lose all that,

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:45.860 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes amazing.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:51.230 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Some astronauts
have described how,

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.480 align:middle line:84%
when they look back at the
Earth from outer space,

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.800 align:middle line:84%
there is a significant
shift in perception.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.360 align:middle line:90%
National boundaries dissolve.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Identity widens.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And they feel a deep
interconnectivity

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.490 align:middle line:90%
with all beings.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.885 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
overview effect.

00:48:14.885 --> 00:48:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that people
who look back at their body

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.870 align:middle line:90%
have a similar experience?

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It breaks you out
of all the old molds,

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and makes you aware
that, oh, my god,

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.970 align:middle line:84%
there's something very
powerful and immortal.

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:47.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm part of it.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm connected to it.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just a mask, in a way, a
kind of coat that we're wearing

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.930 align:middle line:90%
to have certain experiences.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, we're just
infinitely bigger than that.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So in terms of the link
between self-realization

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:14.108 align:middle line:84%
and, for me, the out-of-body
experience were synonymous.

00:49:14.108 --> 00:49:15.150 align:middle line:90%
They were the same thing.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're waking
up from is the past.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We're waking up from
our own unconsciousness.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's a general movement
towards something more, which

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.860 align:middle line:84%
is natural in the very
fabric of what existence is,

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.620 align:middle line:84%
because it's the constant
realization of ever

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.929 align:middle line:90%
greater potential.

00:49:36.929 --> 00:49:41.150 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether or not consciousness
can expand beyond the body is

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.690 align:middle line:84%
still yet to be proved
by mainstream science.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:10%
But what is evident is
that, for many people,

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:10%
these are deeply meaningful
experiences that can shape

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.190 align:middle line:10%
their lives in profound ways.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Reduced fear of death, awakening
experiences, new perspectives

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:17.540 align:middle line:84%
on relationships, transforming
fears, receiving life insights,

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and healing grief can all arise
from out-of-body experiences.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.100 align:middle line:84%
If fully integrated, they
can be a powerful catalyst

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.220 align:middle line:84%
for psychological
and spiritual growth,

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases can lead to
radical self-transformation.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:40.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that struck me most
is how much doing this research

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.550 align:middle line:84%
has opened my eyes and
opened my mind as well.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I think I was very scientific
because of my training

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.540 align:middle line:90%
as a nurse when I started it.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.238 align:middle line:84%
But now, what it's
made me realize

00:50:55.238 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that there's things
out there that we

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.610 align:middle line:90%
have no understanding of.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It bothers me greatly that
there are people out there who

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:04.010 align:middle line:84%
are having disturbed
sleep phenomena--

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.010 align:middle line:84%
like sleep paralysis,
and night terrors,

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and all these kind of things--

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that don't know that they're
sitting on a gold mine.

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a natural
human capacity.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.607 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing special about
having out-of-body experiences.

00:51:16.607 --> 00:51:18.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, possibly what
special or remarkable

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.365 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that people
don't have them more.

00:51:20.365 --> 00:51:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are going to do
it, it's with the purpose

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:84%
of rescuing the traumatized
places of your mind,

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.190 align:middle line:84%
or to create things
in the heavens.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.450 align:middle line:84%
That would make a
huge difference.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> If all seven billion people
had an out-of-body experience,

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:84%
it would suddenly be a
collective consciousness

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.700 align:middle line:90%
wake-up call.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Everyone would go, oh, my god.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.240 align:middle line:90%
What are we fighting over?

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.670 align:middle line:90%
A hunk of dirt?

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the important
thing for all of your viewers

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:50.180 align:middle line:84%
to realize is that they
are very crucial in this.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.670 align:middle line:90%
No soul left behind.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.310 align:middle line:84%
We are all very
important in this journey

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:58.890 align:middle line:90%
of awakening of humanity.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So if that
happened collectively,

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.330 align:middle line:84%
if everybody underwent an
awakening experience and felt

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:05.480 align:middle line:84%
this sense of connection
and compassion,

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.165 align:middle line:84%
then the world would become
an infinitely better place.

00:52:08.165 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You will find
yourself out there.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.600 align:middle line:90%
You will find your limitations.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:90%
You will find your beliefs.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:84%
That is valuable to you, to see
deeper into who you are, deeper

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.570 align:middle line:84%
into why you're here, and deeper
into the nature of reality.

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:36.692 align:middle line:90%

out-of-body experience for you

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.460 align:middle line:90%
in one word?

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.970 align:middle line:10%
>> In one word?

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Awareness.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.330 align:middle line:90%

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:03.310 align:middle line:90%

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:04.110 align:middle line:90%
