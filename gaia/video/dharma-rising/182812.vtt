Gate Park and get stoned.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:90%
It changed with time.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to sit
[INAUDIBLE] stoned, really.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.727 align:middle line:90%

>> Despite these early hiccups,
it was clear that conditions

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
were now ripe for the
Dharma to rise in the West.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
Soon, other Zen teachers were
sailing for Western shores.

Bernie Glassman, Roshi's teacher
Maezumi Roshi in Los Angeles,

and in Paris, [INAUDIBLE]
master Taisen Deshimaru

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.088 align:middle line:90%
were just a few of many.

00:08:49.088 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and Westerners were also taking
advantage of the new jet travel

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to head off to the East, finding
teachers in Japan, Thailand,

Burma, and Ceylon.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of the tragedy
of the Tibetan exodus of 1959,

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
to India and Nepal where
the Dalai Lama and many

Tibetan masters were

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:84%
By the late '60s and early
'70s, the Western-born acolytes

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
were beginning to return home
to face the challenge of how

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to teach the Buddha
Dharma in a culture

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.305 align:middle line:84%
so radically different
from its Asian roots.

00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The rise of modern
technology, transportation,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
This whole society is
radically unlike any society

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that Buddhism has
gravitated to or migrated to

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.352 align:middle line:84%
and then assimilated with
over the last 2,500 years.

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:48.935 align:middle line:84%

unprecedented challenge.

those in spiritual authority.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.846 align:middle line:84%
>> The different women
didn't know about each other.

00:10:01.846 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And there were profound
debates raging in a quietly

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:84%

>> The suitability of
Asian cultural forms--

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We decided it was fine
for people to sit in chairs

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
we do in this culture.

monasticism is something

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%

to be Jewish.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And even the fundamental
question of, what is

the essence of Buddhism itself?

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Though many Buddhists might
disagree on the fine print,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
most would agree
that the essence

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
can be found in the first
teachings of the Buddha.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at the
history of Buddhism,

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
it is always of fine

fundamental, what are sometimes
called the fundamental

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:90%
formulae, of the Buddha.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:90%
So what are they?

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, it's
the law of co-dependent

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:22.020 align:middle line:84%
arising as the root of
the Four Noble Truths.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The Four Noble Truths explain
the nature of the suffering

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and dissatisfaction--

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
its cause, its end, and
the path of practice that

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:90%
leads to its end.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
The law of co-dependent
arising is their foundation.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
It states that all things arise
from an infinite web of cause

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and effect.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And so no thing
exists independently.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything is void or empty
of an inherent self nature.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The implications of this are
as subtle as they are profound.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:10%
And this has made the
role of the teacher

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:10%
essential for their
full unfolding

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:10%
within the mind of the student.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But in today's West, that
role is facing new challenges.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
We begin in the Bay
Area with its largest

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist institution, the
fruit of Suzuki Roshi's

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.956 align:middle line:84%
pioneering efforts, the
San Francisco Zen Center.

00:12:16.956 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the [INAUDIBLE],,
although it's not a great

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:90%
likeness of him.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But what this room
does is give us

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:84%
a place to focus our
gratitude to Suzuki Roshi.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the point of this room.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
He was in this room
as he was dying

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
so that he would be
available to the students,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:84%
for them to see him and him to
see them, up until very soon

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:90%
before he died.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So we bow to him
each time we pass.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We're extremely fortunate
to have this building.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:10%
It was a Jewish residence
hall for young ladies

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:10%
away from their families.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Young ladies in the
'20s didn't live alone.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, this is
very famous for--

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:90%
many matches were made here.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.512 align:middle line:84%
Because people have come
celebrating their 50th wedding

00:13:21.512 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
anniversary and bring
their grandchildren

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to show them where
Grandpa and Grandma met.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is our Zendo,
our meditation hall.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the ceremonial hall.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
This is where we have
morning service every day

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and any ceremonies that
we do-- ordinations,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:90%
funerals, weddings.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Today's Zen Center, as it's
called, is one of the largest,

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
if not the largest, Buddhist
organizations outside Asia.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:84%
The downtown property consists
of a number of buildings

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and is home to between 45 and
65 residents at any given time.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:84%
As well, there's Tassajara
Monastic Center in the Ventana

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Wilderness and the Green
Gulch Farm Practice

Center in Marin County.

00:14:06.765 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to say that the
second abbot, Richard Baker,

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:90%
did a lot to build Zen Center.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:90%
I never wanted him to leave.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I wanted him to say,
gee, that was a mistake.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sorry.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't do that.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Suzuki Roshi's Dharma
heir, Zentatsu Richard Baker,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
became abbot after
Suzuki's death in 1971.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:84%
He was a gifted
organization builder

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
who successfully
raised the money

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to buy the superb real estate
Zen Center enjoys today.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Baker was forced to resign
in 1984 after a scandal that

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:90%
rocked the community.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> He was having--

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
consensual-- but he was
having sexual relationships

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:90%
with students.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:58.213 align:middle line:84%
And people got really upset
about it, and appropriately so.

00:14:58.213 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not appropriate
for a teacher

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.925 align:middle line:84%
to have sexual
relationships with students.

00:15:01.925 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is the Zendo here.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What was interesting from
the point of view of Buddhism

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
in the West was not the scandal,
but the effect on the budding

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
community and how they dealt
with its aftermath both

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.785 align:middle line:84%
psychologically and
organizationally.

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the
death of innocence.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
We had a kind of faith that
was naive and unrealistic.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when it all
happened and we kind of

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
realized that the person we
had faith in and that we had

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:84%
projected was not the person
that was actually there,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:84%
it was enormously disturbing
on a lot of levels.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And so many people had
all kinds of breakdowns.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.225 align:middle line:90%
Many people left overnight.

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Here was this sort of
traditionally hierarchical

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
situation which had
put him in isolation.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So there was no one
who could give him

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.875 align:middle line:84%
the feedback he needed to say,
whoa, this isn't appropriate.

00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> For some time, we were
in almost a holding pattern.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We weren't sure how to proceed
with our religious leadership.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We eventually did a redesign
of our administrative and

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
religious leadership structure.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We did go toward a much
more democratic structure with

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:90%
an elected board.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Up until then, the board, of
course, was all appointed.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But the downside is that
you have a tremendous amount

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:84%
of discussion that
has to take place.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, if
you run a business,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.750 align:middle line:84%
you're really responsible for
people for eight hours a day

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
for that small portion of their

these things very much.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come until the
death of my daughter, Chiara,

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:84%
who died at
two-and-a-half months.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And after she died-- she died
of sudden infant death syndrome.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened,
it was like everything

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:90%
fell apart for me.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that was when
I started looking

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:90%
for the stories of women.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:84%
The [INAUDIBLE],, the temple,
is quite extraordinary.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Once I developed this interest,
I really focused on it.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And some of my male teachers
had a problem with that.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
it was dualistic.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I went into retreat for a year,
partly with that question of,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
is this something
I should give up?

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it dualistic?

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Or is this something that I need
to pursue and continue with?

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And during the retreat,
it was in 2001 to 2002.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so September
that year was 9/11.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
My thought went to, where is
the feminine here in the lives

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:90%
of these men who did this?

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:90%
What about our reaction?

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Where's the feminine in the
reaction of the United States

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:90%
government?

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.440 align:middle line:84%
That was a big sort of
watershed moment for me.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Because it meant that I had
to leave the father's house.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was incredibly
challenging to trust myself.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, as
soon as I started doing that,

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
everything began
to flourish here.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything began to grow
and flourish in a way

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.482 align:middle line:90%
that it hadn't before.

00:28:00.482 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1993, Lama Tsultrim and
her husband had founded Tara

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Mandala in the remote mountains
of southeastern Colorado.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.640 align:middle line:84%
However, raising the
substantial funds

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:84%
necessary to build anything
had been difficult.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:84%
During her retreat in
2001, she had a vision

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:84%
of a magnificent
temple devoted to Tara,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:27.045 align:middle line:84%
a prominent female meditational
deity in the Tibetan pantheon.

00:28:27.045 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:10%
>> On the night of the
Buddha's enlightenment day

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:10%
and parinirvana and his
birthday, I had a dream.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:10%
And in that dream, it
started with a color blue.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:10%
And out of the blue, the
temple began to form.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.520 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:90%
I sat up in bed.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And I went into meditation.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:56.145 align:middle line:84%
And then into my
cabin came this being

00:28:56.145 --> 00:29:02.160 align:middle line:84%
in a sphere of rainbow light
who I recognized as Vimalamitra,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
who brought Buddhism to Tibet,
along with Padmasambava Guru

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Rinpoche.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And he was very clear.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I could see everything--
the hair on his face,

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:90%
the frayed threads on his robe.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And then he began to transmit
the rest of the temple to me.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> In a complete design?

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.126 align:middle line:10%
No toilets or kitchens or--

00:29:35.126 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Because the teacher/student
relationship is normally one

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:10%
of unusual depth, it
can frequently bring any

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:10%
psychological issues in
students to the surface.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
This can enable them
to heal and grow.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:53.828 align:middle line:84%
But it can also result in
an unhealthy dependency.

00:29:53.828 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Reggie Ray was formerly a
professor at Naropa University

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and a teacher in
Shambala International.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Reggie resigned from
both institutions

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to found Dharma Ocean
in Crestone, Colorado,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.642 align:middle line:84%
overlooking the immense
and windy San Juan Valley.

00:30:12.642 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people that come to the
Dharma come with a preexisting

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:24.100 align:middle line:84%
sense of a tremendous
disempowerment as individuals.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And they are often
initially attracted--

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
for example, within Tibetan
Buddhism-- to the Lamas

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:84%
who are presented as
being enlightened.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, our
sense of disempowerment

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:84%
makes us very vulnerable to
projecting onto our teachers

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
some kind of idealized
father that we never had.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, initially on the
path, that's necessary.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:90%
That motivates us to practice.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's a good thing.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But what often
happens, especially

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.080 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan
tradition, is that people

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
enter into a lifelong
dependency on their Rimpoche

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:04.990 align:middle line:90%
or their Lama.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I have found over
the course of my teaching

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:84%
is that that lifelong dependency
makes it impossible for them

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:90%
to grow in certain ways.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it impossible
for them to really enter

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.576 align:middle line:90%
an adult stage of spirituality.

00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the protector up there.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the mountain
where the protection

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.315 align:middle line:84%
energy of this whole
area is constellated.

00:31:30.315 --> 00:31:35.090 align:middle line:84%
One of the issues
that comes up is,

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.810 align:middle line:90%
what about the Asian teachers?

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't they see that?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And aren't they
interested or motivated

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to unravel that or untangle
it, dismantle that Oedipal

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:90%
dependency of their students?

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a very interesting
cultural issue.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Because in Tibet, that
lifelong dependency

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:90%
was cultivated with lay people.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the vista is
about 100 miles from--

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:84%
If you were a layperson,
that was kind of how it was.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem we have
in the West is,

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:84%
when many of the Asian
teachers look at Westerners,

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:90%
they see lay people.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And they see people
that maybe they

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.108 align:middle line:84%
feel aren't going to
practice very much,

00:32:18.108 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and aren't really going
to study very much,

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and aren't going to
make the journey.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's a kind of
toleration on the side

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Asian teachers
of that Oedipal

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:84%
dependency in a lifelong
way that reinforces it.

we're going to have to practice

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.485 align:middle line:90%


00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:84%
That is one of
the main problems,

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the West is the
complexities of the society.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And it runs well because it's
got a lot of fine detail in it.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.250 align:middle line:84%
How you build something,
health and safety procedures,

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.645 align:middle line:90%
they're enormously detailed.

00:35:30.645 --> 00:35:34.059 align:middle line:90%


00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The traditional monastic
model is finding a place

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:84%
in the West, but often in hybrid
form, such as at Plum Village,

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:84%
a monastery and nunnery
in the South of France.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:10%
Part of an international
network of monasteries

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.340 align:middle line:10%
whose spiritual leader is the
highly regarded Vietnamese Zen

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:10%
monk Thich Nhat
Hanh, it is supported

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:59.260 align:middle line:10%
by both the Vietnamese
and convert communities.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Phap Luu is an American who sees
an advantage to monastic life.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel it's easier to be
100% immersed in the practice,

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to really let go of all
the other attachments.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The things that we
have to do, working

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and having a house or a place
to sleep at night, a car,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:90%
girlfriend.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I see that, since I became a
monk, those things, in a way,

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:84%
we close the door on
that aspect of our life.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.975 align:middle line:84%
And so we can concentrate
100% on just the one

00:36:36.975 --> 00:36:39.642 align:middle line:90%
door of the practice.

00:36:39.642 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> In a practice center, when
you're living there year after

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:46.910 align:middle line:84%
year, all of life really
does become Dharma.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything is-- you hear
the temple bell every day.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:84%
You're doing ritual
practice every day.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You're really living
in a Dharma environment

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:90%
and never leaving it.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
level of inner change.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You really do begin to have
a perspective that everything

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.920 align:middle line:84%
is Dharma, your
whole life is Dharma.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
downsides to it as well.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a life of conformity.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a life of rules.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.932 align:middle line:90%
It's a life of limitation.

00:37:20.932 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> There certainly will be
a certain group of monastics

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.670 align:middle line:84%
in the West, and I
think that's fine.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's an
old fashioned style

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:90%
of life, monasticism.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.970 align:middle line:90%
For me, it belongs to feudalism.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Others believe
it always belongs.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.580 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-'60s, Robert Thurman
became the first American monk

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan
Buddhist tradition.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Today, he holds a
chair in Indo Tibetan

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Buddhism depends upon
communities having this

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.610 align:middle line:84%
generosity to support people
who do nothing useful,

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:84%
who do nothing productive
from a social point of view.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Because in fact, they do the
ultimately productive thing

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:84%
from the Buddhist
community's point of view--

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.440 align:middle line:84%
the insiders' community
point of view-- which is they

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:90%
seek freedom.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They seek to understand
the nature of reality.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:84%
They represent the full
devotion to that quest

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the community.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
inspire the lay community

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to try to live at a
higher ethical standard,

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to try to develop more,
focus more of their time

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.070 align:middle line:84%
on the quest of
freedom, in reality.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if fully
ordained and fully vow-keeping

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.440 align:middle line:84%
monks and nuns are not in
the Buddhist community,

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.940 align:middle line:90%
there is no Buddhist community.

00:38:39.508 --> 00:38:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> As Buddhism has become
established in the West,

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist studies departments
have sprouted up within

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.730 align:middle line:90%
the halls of academia.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.820 align:middle line:84%
While they teach scholarship
and not practice,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:84%
they frequently employ scholars
who are also practitioners.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have to
remain in the closet

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.212 align:middle line:90%
about their practice.

00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> To say that one is a Buddhist
scholar and practitioner would

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
just cause people to
go into conniptions.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:12.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would
say, as recently

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:84%
as 10 or 12 years
ago, you wouldn't

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.710 align:middle line:90%
say that on your resume.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't
continue to get jobs.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be counted as
a genuine academic, not as

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.960 align:middle line:90%
a scholar.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.180 align:middle line:84%
A scholar has to have
a certain objectivity,

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.960 align:middle line:84%
as though anyone who had
some feeling for a tradition

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:41.250 align:middle line:84%
might use your position as
a pulpit to convert people.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:42.435 align:middle line:90%
It's very suspect.

00:39:42.435 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I am sad to report that
the academic world in the West

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:84%
still remains sort of
prisoner of a certain duality.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.380 align:middle line:84%
In a way, Christianity
is still very

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:90%
powerful in religious studies.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And so on the one
hand, that element

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:84%
is still somehow
[? subterranean ?] present.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's its kind
of equal and opposite,

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.580 align:middle line:84%
which is dogmatic secularism
or dogmatic materialism,

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.260 align:middle line:84%
of which the scientists are the
high priests, you could say.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So-called scientists
are the high priests.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the orthodoxy for
Buddhist studies scholars

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:22.620 align:middle line:84%
still is that you should be
an anti-Buddhist, actually,

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:90%
sadly to say.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Not merely just critically
evaluate, but actually anti.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a
Christian person

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:84%
can go to Christian
church and then

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.020 align:middle line:84%
study Christianity
in a favorable way

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.500 align:middle line:84%
without intruding,
supposedly, his or her

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Christian dogmas and things.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But a Buddhist can't,
especially a convert Buddhist.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Because they're like aliens.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they have to
actually be anti.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And the big game to advance
their careers in academia

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:84%
is to try to show
Buddha was screwed up.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Maybe Buddha had a girlfriend.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Or some Buddhist
teacher is no good.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Or some Hindu swami was a
gay, or I don't know what.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of thing
to show that they're

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:84%
as bad as the Western
religions are.

obstacles, I think,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.190 align:middle line:84%
in Western Buddhism is the
fact that Western people,

in their materialistic
arrogance,

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.945 align:middle line:84%

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that is attainable by an
individual that then makes you

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.590 align:middle line:90%

Buddhism has had 2,500
years to elaborate

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.180 align:middle line:84%
on the original
teachings of the Buddha

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.510 align:middle line:84%
within a wide variety
of Asian cultures.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, Western Dharma
teachers have the task

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.030 align:middle line:84%
of separating out the
essence of the Dharma

from its Asian cultural forms.

essentials, I don't think.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it's inseparable
from culture.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.120 align:middle line:90%
It comes from people.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And it does, however, evolve
in different cultural contexts.

happens, people

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.083 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to ask
themselves, what is baby

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:84%
retreats for his
Western students.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it true or is it not
that people have past lives?

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Can we explore this
rigorously, objectively,

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.370 align:middle line:84%
so that it stands up to even
the most careful scrutiny?

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>> An experienced practitioner
of long-term solitary retreats,

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.320 align:middle line:84%
he is very traditional in his
opinions about some of the new

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:84%
interpretive currents
emerging in Western Buddhism.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> As Buddhism moves
into modernity,

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.450 align:middle line:84%
it's facing perhaps its greatest
challenge and its greatest

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:90%
opportunity since its inception.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, we find the
secularization of Buddhism.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.720 align:middle line:84%
There is, of course,
a lot of antipathy

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.360 align:middle line:84%
towards a religion of
any kind by many secular

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.710 align:middle line:90%
people in the modern world.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And so some people with this at
least a great sense of unease,

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps actual
antipathy towards religion,

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.210 align:middle line:90%
then look at Buddhism.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And they look at it and say,
well, this is a religion too.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, it has very
major religious aspects.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.140 align:middle line:90%
But we can salvage it.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:90%
We can salvage it.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.630 align:middle line:90%
We can save Buddhism.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we'll
just take what we like.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we
like mindfulness.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:47.110 align:middle line:84%
We like the cultivation
of loving kindness.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:50.140 align:middle line:84%
We like the ethical
principles of non-violence.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.940 align:middle line:90%
We like compassion.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And what winds up coming out
of this very selective approach

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is Buddhism really then is
reincarnated, so to speak.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Or it evolves and
mutates into something

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:84%
that I would say is tantamount
to a new school of psychology.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.650 align:middle line:84%
It has heavily
psychologized all references

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:13.900 align:middle line:84%
to what the promoters of this
approach deem metaphysical.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Such things as the continuity
of individual consciousness

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.640 align:middle line:84%
after death, the re-embodiment
of consciousness.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So we call it
reincarnation or rebirth.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The nature of karma, the
patterns or regularities

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.070 align:middle line:84%
of karma, called
the laws of karma.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:84%
The qualities of
enlightenment itself.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, claims about the
greatly higher capacities

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.840 align:middle line:84%
in terms of heightened
awareness, paranormal qualities

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:90%
or abilities.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.440 align:middle line:84%
They either marginalize
these things

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.050 align:middle line:84%
as if they're not really
important or just flat out say,

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:43.270 align:middle line:84%
this is part of the
superstition of Buddhism.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And everything that does
not, say, correspond to

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:84%
or is not compatible with
scientific materialism

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and the discoveries of
science now, oh, the Buddha

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.755 align:middle line:90%
never taught that.

00:45:53.755 --> 00:45:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha never dealt
with metaphysics.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.860 align:middle line:84%
As if metaphysics is one
category that we defined.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, as a universal, that
what is beyond our experience

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is beyond everybody's
experience.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.630 align:middle line:84%
That's just ethnocentrism and
a type of really intellectual

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:08.960 align:middle line:90%
colonialism.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The target of much of
Alan Wallace's criticism is

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:17.050 align:middle line:84%
the ideas of his fellow Tibetan
monk of old, Steven Batchelor,

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
a writer, artist, and Dharma
teacher based near Bordeaux

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:90%
in France.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.920 align:middle line:84%
If Allen is among the most
traditional Western Buddhist

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.990 align:middle line:84%
teachers, Stephen
would certainly

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.560 align:middle line:90%
be among the most reform minded.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The ideas in his latest book
are highly controversial.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, they are
getting a wide hearing

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.060 align:middle line:90%
in the Buddhist community.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Based on his research
into the Pali canon

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:44.300 align:middle line:84%
he's reached an unconventional
interpretation of what

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.186 align:middle line:90%
the Buddha actually taught.

00:46:47.186 --> 00:46:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm basing my work at
the moment on my reading,

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and I think a fairly
close reading,

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.820 align:middle line:84%
of certain early texts
within the Pali tradition.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, I'm basing my
work on my own practice

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:08.360 align:middle line:84%
of nearly 40 years of trying to
understand these teachings, not

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.080 align:middle line:84%
just intellectually, but
also through contemplation,

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.150 align:middle line:84%
meditation, reflection,
through my work.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.880 align:middle line:84%
You see, for me, the
practice of the Dharma

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.640 align:middle line:90%
engages the whole of one's life.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha spoke of it
as the eightfold path.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:33.260 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a cummerbund
that I found in a dumpster.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:84%
That used to be just a
supermarket shopping bag.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.320 align:middle line:84%
To me, the practice
is the cultivation

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of all eight aspects of that
path, including reflection,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.300 align:middle line:84%
including the work
you do, including

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:84%
your ethical
relationships, including

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:53.390 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual
practices, including

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.610 align:middle line:90%
your view of the world.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And for me, therefore, a
practice cannot be reduced

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.180 align:middle line:84%
simply to becoming proficient
in certain meditative skills.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I certainly would not dismiss
the importance of that.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.580 align:middle line:84%
But I would insist that
meditation practice always

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:20.480 align:middle line:84%
be contextualized by the wider
frame of the eightfold path

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.350 align:middle line:84%
itself, in other
words, the way of life

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:24.980 align:middle line:90%
that the Buddha encouraged.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Rather than reductively saying,
this kind of meditative insight

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:31.633 align:middle line:90%
is the key to enlightenment.

00:48:31.633 --> 00:48:33.485 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:48:33.485 --> 00:48:36.726 align:middle line:90%


00:48:36.726 --> 00:48:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The central point around
which all of traditional

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism revolves is the
enlightenment of the Buddha,

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.940 align:middle line:84%
the nirvana that he stated
is the potential of everyone,

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and many since are
said to have realized.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:53.340 align:middle line:90%
But what is it?

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The first writers
on Zen in English

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.920 align:middle line:84%
were influenced by the
Rinzai-school, which emphasizes

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:04.020 align:middle line:84%
satori, or kensho, a sudden and
brief enlightenment experience

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:08.000 align:middle line:84%
transcending normal
dualistic consciousness

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:84%
where one directly knows the
ultimate nature of reality.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Later, Japanese Zen teachers,
mostly of the Soto school,

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:21.300 align:middle line:84%
like the San Francisco Zen
Center of Shunryu Suzuki,

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:25.740 align:middle line:84%
instead emphasized the gradual
dawning of the awakened mind

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.695 align:middle line:90%
in and as meditation practice.

00:49:28.695 --> 00:49:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> He was following Dogen's
teaching, which was Zazen.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Not just Zazen, but
Zazen is enlightenment.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So he always emphasized
the practice.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Just do the practice.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to do it
for some reason.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to get
something out of practice.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So his practice is really
the purest practice.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it was not
intended to get anything.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:02.328 align:middle line:84%
It's simply just, you do
something for nothing.

00:50:02.328 --> 00:50:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
start to want something,

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:90%
it's no longer pure practice.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look in the text
the way the Buddha taught,

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.280 align:middle line:90%
he said--

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.830 align:middle line:84%
awakening happens gradually and
slowly like the great oceans.

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Go deeper and deeper and
deeper as you follow out

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.720 align:middle line:90%
from the shore line.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, in another
text, he says--

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.380 align:middle line:84%
stream entry, the dropping
away of all illusions

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.430 align:middle line:84%
of self and separation happens
in a flash, in a moment.

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And enlightenment itself can
be this great, dramatic moment

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.830 align:middle line:84%
of release from the
separate body of fear

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:43.510 align:middle line:84%
or the small sense of self into
the vast awakening of the heart

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:45.730 align:middle line:90%
that is our true nature.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Which is true?

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.920 align:middle line:84%
As is always the case in
these beautiful Buddhist

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.080 align:middle line:90%
teachings, yes.

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes is the answer.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The traditional understanding
that resolves this seeming

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.760 align:middle line:10%
paradox is that each approach
emphasizes different aspects

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.840 align:middle line:10%
of the path towards
Buddhahood or arhatship.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Sudden glimpses
of non-duality can

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:15.390 align:middle line:84%
set the compass heading towards
the state of enlightenment.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But the mind still needs to
mature through gradual practice

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and deepening insight
into emptiness,

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.040 align:middle line:90%
the non-self nature, reality.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.530 align:middle line:84%
However, today, many
in Western Buddhism

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.200 align:middle line:84%
give these experiences
less credence.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they question
something even more basic,

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that there is such a thing
as the enlightened state.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The concept that everybody
in the West had in the beginning

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.310 align:middle line:90%
of the enlightened master.

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And the goal was enlightenment,
and everybody would come

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.810 align:middle line:90%
and try to get enlightened.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And the place was run by an
enlightened master who would

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.570 align:middle line:90%
have an enlightened successor.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
groping for that goal.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.430 align:middle line:90%
That was never the case.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:00.020 align:middle line:90%
That was never the case in Asia.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It was never the case
anywhere, that even--

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.480 align:middle line:84%
it was a projection of us,
we American young people.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:14.210 align:middle line:84%
It was a romantic, idealistic,
individualistic projection,

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.750 align:middle line:84%
which was aided and abetted
by the Asian teachers who

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.120 align:middle line:84%
came here, who were influenced
by that view themselves.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, almost
all the Asian teachers

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.210 align:middle line:84%
who came here were aware
of Western thought,

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:27.680 align:middle line:84%
were aware of
Western psychology,

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.540 align:middle line:84%
were aware of the Enlightenment
lust that people had--

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.700 align:middle line:90%
and spoke to that.

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> But what is Buddhahood?

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I studied
with Zen teachers

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:40.740 align:middle line:84%
who talk about small
satoris and big satoris.

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know the
Tibetan description

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.460 align:middle line:90%
of the bodhisattva bhumis.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, I have not
found one single teacher up

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:59.290 align:middle line:84%
to now who could present
to me in his life,

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.230 align:middle line:90%
in his person or her person--

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:84%
in the way they could
explain the path--

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that I have a clear image
of what enlightenment is,

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:90%
except the lists I have learned.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.300 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, people
claim experiences.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have no reason to doubt
the veracity of what they say.

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, simply to
make a first person claim,

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:38.640 align:middle line:84%
it does not carry a lot
of explanatory power.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.010 align:middle line:84%
The more such
first person claims

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.860 align:middle line:84%
there were, the more
authority they might have.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that for the Dharma
to be articulated in our day

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and age, we need somehow to
bring together both our powers

00:53:54.930 --> 00:54:00.090 align:middle line:84%
of reason, our philosophies,
our scientific understanding

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:04.140 align:middle line:84%
of the world, as well as
the kinds of experiences

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:09.120 align:middle line:84%
that are opened up to us in the
practice of meditation itself.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't want to
privilege one particular

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:84%
experience-- let's
say of non-duality--

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and give that some
kind of prestige,

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:27.270 align:middle line:84%
rather than recognizing how the
Dharma and the stream in which

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:30.120 align:middle line:84%
one enters is
something that engages

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.400 align:middle line:90%
the whole of one's experience.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't have
much time, frankly,

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:39.250 align:middle line:90%
for these ideas of non-duality.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:40.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is the authority?

00:54:40.992 --> 00:54:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And who has experienced
enlightenment at the standard

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.636 align:middle line:90%
that they can talk about?

00:54:45.636 --> 00:54:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Matthieu Ricard,
once a geneticist,

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:52.680 align:middle line:84%
is now a Tibetan monk in the
Nyingma Dzogchen tradition that

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.000 align:middle line:84%
emphasizes the non-dual state
of enlightenment as the aim

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.395 align:middle line:90%
of Buddhist practice.

00:54:58.395 --> 00:55:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So you see, there's a
difference between rumbling

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.480 align:middle line:84%
with ideas and
then what came out

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddha's enlightenment
as his teachings,

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:14.340 align:middle line:84%
the commentary that
propose an elucidation

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddha's work by
people like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, the great
masters of the tradition

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.030 align:middle line:84%
in Tibet, and up to modern
[? realist ?] teacher,

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:27.460 align:middle line:84%
like those we are
lucky enough to meet.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, those,
they refer directly

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.670 align:middle line:90%
to their own [? validation. ?]

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Plus, if you need, they will
come with a perfectly logical

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and based on the scripture.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.145 align:middle line:84%
They have immense
knowledge of the scripture.

00:55:41.145 --> 00:55:44.550 align:middle line:90%
They have immense experience.

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So how can you put
that on the scale?

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Put the whole Buddha's teaching
on one side and somebody's idea

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:50.860 align:middle line:90%
on the other side?

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
projected right in space.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The nature of the
enlightenment experience

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.360 align:middle line:84%
by ordinary people
is inconceivable.

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
tend to collapse it

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:90%
into one of two options.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.500 align:middle line:84%
One option is a kind of
annihilation of everything

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:19.380 align:middle line:84%
where nirvana is another
world of no experience at all.

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they cannot imagine
blissful experience--

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.680 align:middle line:84%
all experiences,
even what we normally

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:84%
would think of his
pain-- as ecstatic.

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They cannot imagine
a state like that.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So they think nirvana must be an
annihilation of consciousness,

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:33.820 align:middle line:90%
of subjectivity.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's one extreme.

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And the other extreme
is they collapse it

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:39.030 align:middle line:84%
into being some
sort of euphemistic,

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:42.930 align:middle line:84%
kind a little bit deceptive,
way of luring people

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:46.170 align:middle line:84%
into resignation to
ordinariness, full resignation

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:48.772 align:middle line:90%
into ordinariness.

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> If indeed the ultimate goal
of Buddhism is Buddhahood,

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:57.260 align:middle line:84%
or arhatship, it does require
a great amount of practice.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally,
Asian Buddhists

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.300 align:middle line:84%
have accepted that it
is an ongoing process

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.070 align:middle line:90%
over multiple lifetimes.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But scientifically
educated Westerners

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:10.790 align:middle line:84%
tend to be skeptical that
any aspect of consciousness

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.830 align:middle line:90%
can traverse death.

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And so many Western Buddhists
are agnostic about rebirth

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:19.735 align:middle line:84%
or take the attitude that
it is a cultural remnant

00:57:19.735 --> 00:57:22.700 align:middle line:84%
of Buddhism's Indian
roots rather than

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:28.150 align:middle line:84%
a foundational realization in
advanced meditation practice.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, first,
rebirth is a speculation.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Rebirth is a concept.

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I would say rebirth is an
expectation aimed at justice

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:47.020 align:middle line:90%
which is not observable.

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> In the traditional
understanding of rebirth,

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:53.490 align:middle line:84%
one's underlying stream of
moment-to-moment consciousness

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:58.800 align:middle line:84%
is reborn because of karma, the
causal seeds planted by past

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.120 align:middle line:90%
intentional actions.

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Carola Roloff is a Tibetan nun
doing postdoctoral research

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:07.060 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Hamburg.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This teaching on karma and
rebirth was the reason why I

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:17.490 align:middle line:84%
converted from Protestant
Christianity to Buddhism.

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I was looking for, what
is the reason for suffering?

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
believe that God is

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:25.677 align:middle line:84%
giving suffering to
the sentient beings

00:58:25.677 --> 00:58:26.885 align:middle line:90%
if he has created everything.

00:58:26.885 --> 00:58:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I am not open to the fact
of adhering to those doctrines

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:34.740 align:middle line:84%
simply because tradition
requires me to.

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And particularly,
a tradition where

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:41.000 align:middle line:84%
you can find a number of
passages in the earliest canon

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.300 align:middle line:84%
where the Buddha
himself speaks very

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:50.190 align:middle line:84%
dismissively of being concerned
about what happens after death,

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:51.330 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:53.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not clear-cut.

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:55.770 align:middle line:90%
The Buddha is ambivalent.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Some passages have him
speaking about rebirth.

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Others have him rather
skeptical about it.

00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think what the
Buddha was probably

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:09.390 align:middle line:84%
saying was that this sort of
conversation we're having now

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is actually kind of
missing the point.

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:15.300 align:middle line:84%
That to get so
preoccupied with issues

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that are basically tangential
to the core practice

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.680 align:middle line:90%
is basically a waste of time.

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.520 align:middle line:84%
What exactly it
is that is reborn?

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it me?

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it my unfinished business?

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Probably, yes.

00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, is it reborn by some
kind of magical device dropping

00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:41.500 align:middle line:84%
into the zygote when sperm
and egg get together,

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and the third bit comes in,
plop, and that's your karma?

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it like that, which
some Tibetans would argue?

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Or is it, as a Westerner
such as myself might argue,

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:54.330 align:middle line:84%
to say that there is the
biological inheritance--

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:57.180 align:middle line:84%
which you could, if you
want, call biological karma--

00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:58.920 align:middle line:90%
namely the genome?

00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, because of
the cleverness of our genome,

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:08.230 align:middle line:84%
we begin to acquire learning
from parents, schools?

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And the whole cultural
stuff comes in

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:12.870 align:middle line:84%
with its prejudices,
its likes and dislikes,

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:17.020 align:middle line:84%
the whole karmic stuff which
creates trouble in life?

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, when I hear
about reincarnation,

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I usually think of this as
the reincarnation of karma

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:24.475 align:middle line:84%
which has come from
preceding generations.

01:00:24.475 --> 01:00:25.350 align:middle line:90%
And we've learned it.

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
We've acquired it
through culture.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not being dropped in some
magical way into our zygote.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.200 align:middle line:90%
That's my own view.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But then, I'm a biologist,
so I would think that way.

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at the notion of
a continuum of consciousness--

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
because after all,
rebirth is about that.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
culture in the West.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It's completely out of the
culture to believe in rebirth.

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:52.150 align:middle line:84%
In the East, it's so common
that you don't even question it.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But the real question is, what's
the nature of consciousness?

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
From Buddhists, that
analysis is very clear.

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
The immediately preceding event
that triggers the next one,

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:07.490 align:middle line:84%
there has to be some kind
of coherence of nature.

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go from,
in one instance,

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
being a seed of wheat, and then
the next instance here you have

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.830 align:middle line:90%
an apple.

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.840 align:middle line:90%
There is a continuum in the--

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
so that means the totally
inanimate instant,

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the next instance, [INAUDIBLE]

the ultimate value

of the tulku system
is not whether it's

1981 when he died,

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%

But there has now arisen,
in the form of a fellow

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
who is 22 years old, his
successor, the 17th Karmapa,

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:55.360 align:middle line:84%
who has just made his first
trip two years ago to the West.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
He presents the continuity
of the inspiration

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
of a way of practicing and
being as a human being.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:09.940 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean to the
thousands of followers?

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Do they have to believe that
some magical transmission

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
of a human personality
went somewhere for 14 years

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and then reemerged
in a little baby?

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Or do they experience
the continuity

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
of a particular wisdom
that helps them?

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the proof
of the tulki system

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
isn't about whether rebirth
or reincarnation is true.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It's about whether the
succession of teachers

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:43.975 align:middle line:84%
actually bring benefit
to human beings.

01:03:43.975 --> 01:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In the tulku system,
as in any institution,

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
human politics can play a part.

The recognition of the
aforementioned 17th Karmapa,

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
for example, is in dispute
with an alternative candidate

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%

of the previous incarnation.

The dispute has been
acrimonious and has boiled over

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:11.740 align:middle line:10%
into Western Dharma
centers, causing one teacher

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.650 align:middle line:10%
to question if the
tulku institution should

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:18.190 align:middle line:10%
be part of Tibetan
Buddhism in the West.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%

Just look at the situation.

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to comment.

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So [INAUDIBLE] the traditional
society some regulation that

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:45.390 align:middle line:90%
don't work in the West.

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a system
without regulation.

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not a Buddhist system.

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of more feudal.

01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:57.540 align:middle line:90%


01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%

>> Just as the essence of the
teachings is being questioned

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
in the West, so new ways of
applying it are developing.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
The notion that individuals
and their societies

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
can be free from
selfishness and greed

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.320 align:middle line:90%
is implicit within the Dharma.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they are the causal
result of the ignorance,

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
of the non-self
nature of things,

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
they are extinguished by the
compassion that flows directly

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
from the awakened heart.

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
In the West, that compassion
has resulted in the emergence

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.310 align:middle line:90%
of a socially engaged Buddhism.

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
About 30 years ago,
Bernie Glassman Roshi

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.648 align:middle line:84%
started doing street retreats,
living among homeless people.

01:05:45.648 --> 01:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that happens
when you live in the streets,

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
you're living in the moment.

01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
That's something we're trying
to get people to experience.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to get them to
experience that in the streets.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But after the retreat
was over, what

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
struck me was that the
only religious groups,

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
spiritual groups, that were
assisting folks in the streets

01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.210 align:middle line:90%
were Christian.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, a little after that,
I did a very big program

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
called Greyston, which worked
with the homeless in Yonkers.

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:21.700 align:middle line:90%
They're large scale.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%
That's me about 30 years ago.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> His economic
development initiatives,

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Greyston Bakery and Foundation,
grew into multi-million dollar

enterprises and
provided work, services,

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and low-cost housing for the
poorest members of the Yonkers,

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
New York Community, where he
was based until a half a dozen

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:41.820 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's with my--

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.555 align:middle line:90%
he's my clown teacher.

01:06:47.555 --> 01:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> At that time, he divested
of all administrative positions

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and was looking
forward to freedom from

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.750 align:middle line:84%
their time-draining
responsibilities.

01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But instead, his community
prevailed upon him

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:02.290 align:middle line:90%
to start something new.

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And he purchased an abandoned
anti-nuclear commune

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:07.500 align:middle line:90%
in western Massachusetts.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I had given away everything.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I had been abbott
of a few places,

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and still have abbots
at those places.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I still have somebody
to run Greyston.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800 align:middle line:90%
I had no assets.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I did not want that.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the streets
to be my headquarters.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, there were
people that said,

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.757 align:middle line:84%
we really should
have a mother house.

01:07:26.757 --> 01:07:28.465 align:middle line:84%
There should be
something for the future.

01:07:28.465 --> 01:07:30.183 align:middle line:90%
It's not just you, Bernie.

01:07:30.183 --> 01:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
You can't just live
in the streets.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And you couldn't
say no to that.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And yeah,
eventually, I gave in.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Part of me regrets it
because I wound up back

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
into raising money and paying
off debts and all of that.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had gotten at
that time to a place

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.150 align:middle line:90%
where I didn't have anything.

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:56.980 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have any--

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.540 align:middle line:84%
it was the freedom
of the streets,

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%
which I've always loved.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.076 align:middle line:84%
But I understand the
importance of the future.

01:08:05.076 --> 01:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%

numerous ways to apply Zen.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
He started the Zen
Peacemakers Order

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
in the 1980s, which now has 70
affiliates on five continents.

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And he's been leading retreats
to Auschwitz since 1994.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Over the last few
years, he's begun

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.380 align:middle line:90%
the prototype of a new program.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's what we call Zen
Houses, which would be places

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
for Dharma practitioners
to practice their Dharma

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and to serve the community.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.606 align:middle line:84%
I want every Zen House to
have what I'm calling a cafe.

01:08:42.606 --> 01:08:49.405 align:middle line:84%
The motto of our cafe is fine
food, music, games, puppetry,

01:08:49.405 --> 01:08:50.205 align:middle line:90%
and wellness.

which is service with

01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you come to
our cafe, you can't

01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:04.410 align:middle line:90%
tell who's poor, who's rich.

of wellness components.

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.279 align:middle line:90%
We have a medical director.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%

the interdependence of

one of the principle students

01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of the late Taisen Deshimaru,
who brought Zen to France

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s and founded the
Association Zen Internationale,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.645 align:middle line:84%
today the largest
Zen group in Europe.

01:10:44.645 --> 01:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%

principle is fantastic.

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%

at the beginning of planting

01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:00.750 align:middle line:90%
the Dharma in the West.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we spend too much time on
bakeries and things like that,

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.210 align:middle line:90%
it takes a lot of energy.

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And what I am doing is
teaching all kind of people.

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I advise them to really
practice the Dharma

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.030 align:middle line:90%
in their professions.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:28.080 align:middle line:90%
in my sangha.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And those people, I
advise them that when

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
they are working as a
doctor or as a nurse,

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
should make it really
[INAUDIBLE] Dharma practice.

But [? I'm ?] not [? going ?]
to make a Zen hospital.

It is better to be
a true bodhisattva.

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And I strongly believe necessary
ritual, practice in temples,

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
to practice [INAUDIBLE]
in the right form,

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.430 align:middle line:90%
and respecting the tradition.

01:11:56.430 --> 01:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%

went to Burma and talked about

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan Buddhism, many of
the Burmese believed Tibetan

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism to be some weird,
perverted form of Hindu Tantra

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
which had images of the Buddha
in carnal positions with women.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
believe it was Buddhism.

Burmese when they would go,

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:58.160 align:middle line:84%
or the Thais when they would
go, and visit Japan and see

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Zen masters hitting people
with sticks, they would--

01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:02.390 align:middle line:84%
as one of my great
Burmese masters

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:04.190 align:middle line:90%
said-- this can't be Buddhism.

01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddha never taught
us to hit people with sticks.

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:08.240 align:middle line:90%
This is an aberration.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Or you have the Zen people
who would look at Theravada

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%

only low class.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.970 align:middle line:90%
They don't have emptiness.

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:16.842 align:middle line:84%
Or the Tibetans who would
think it was hinayanas.

01:13:16.842 --> 01:13:18.800 align:middle line:84%

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
in Threavada and
Vipassana practice.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But almost everyone has also
trained in Tibetan Vajrayana

of what's happening in the West

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
at this time is that we're
able to draw on and learn--

not in a potpourri way, but
in a deep understanding--

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.560 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE] with me, he
would do Jewish teachings and I

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.610 align:middle line:90%
would do Zen teachings.

01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And we would do this
thing side by side.

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And it became really
a problem because we

01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:04.680 align:middle line:90%
were inviting comparisons.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of ended
up doing retreats

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.210 align:middle line:90%
that were comparative religion.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't that good.

01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Because then, you're
always comparing,

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and it gets theoretical.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, a lot
of the Jewish people

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:22.157 align:middle line:84%
were comparing Judaism quite
unfavorably to Buddhism.

01:15:22.157 --> 01:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the people who
were coming to the retreats

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
were people who liked
Buddhism and were

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
drawn to the Buddhism
part and wanted to vent

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:30.820 align:middle line:90%
their problems with Judaism.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So this was very hard
on the poor rabbi.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, we decided to
just make it Jewish meditation

01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and not have any
reference to Buddhism.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest
and tell people,

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
well, we were just
borrowing a technique

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that we both learned in
an unbroken lineage that

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.710 align:middle line:90%
was strong.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were taking
that technique

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and applying it to Judaism.

mostly from one Japanese Roshi--

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%

really matters.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%

transcends all frameworks.

If that's theoretically
true, it really

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.190 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make any difference.

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as you
open up your mouth,

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as you are a
person, you're in a framework.

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the frameworks
do matter quite a bit.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> My own teacher, Master
[? Sheng Yen, ?] made the point

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that practice must be
dependent upon concept.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And the concept of
the practice of Zen

01:16:55.710 --> 01:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
is Four Noble Truths and the
law of co-dependent arising, all

01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:01.870 align:middle line:90%
of that.

01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So any master who, as it were,
transmits to somebody just

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:08.970 align:middle line:84%
because they've had
a kensho experience

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and who want to go and
talk about their experience

01:18:47.875 --> 01:18:48.675 align:middle line:90%
that are to come?

01:18:48.675 --> 01:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> My students have told
me, Professor Willis,

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:53.580 align:middle line:90%
that's not quite fair.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.380 align:middle line:90%
If we do it this way--

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
by picking and
choosing, by being free,

01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:01.442 align:middle line:84%
by mixing traditions--
that is American Buddhism.

01:19:01.442 --> 01:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
the American Buddhism.

01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Stop resisting.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And I say, but I want to
be able to recognize it.

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Do I call it psychology?

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Do I call it stress reduction?

01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Do I call it art?

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to
recognize it as Buddhism.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:23.892 align:middle line:84%
So there, I'm old hat, old
traditionalist conservative.

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> From my standpoint,
I say that everybody has

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.770 align:middle line:90%
the ingredients they have.

01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And they make the best
offerings they have.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So if there are
offerings being made

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else says,
well, that's watering down,

01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
well, there's always millions
of offerings being made.

01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And for those who
are ready and only

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
ready to work with
those methods that

01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
look like they're watering down
things, that's the right thing.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.880 align:middle line:84%
That is moving them
a step or whatever.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And for those who
want other things,

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.260 align:middle line:90%
they'll find other things.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people who live
among us in normal business

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
activity and careers who are
dedicating 100 days a year

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:10.200 align:middle line:84%
to deep retreat practice, who
are dedicating two to three

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.530 align:middle line:84%
hours a day of meditation
practice that they weave

01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
into their so-called
normal lives.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
We lose sight that there
are thousands of Westerners

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.750 align:middle line:84%
with a deep connection
to the Dharma

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
who aren't doing purely
the monastic tradition,

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.540 align:middle line:84%
as it was known or it
was done in the East,

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:31.530 align:middle line:84%
but are really mixing that
deep transformative Buddhist

01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:34.650 align:middle line:84%
meditation practice
with their everyday role

01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:36.330 align:middle line:84%
in the society and
life in the West.

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:37.686 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:20:37.686 --> 01:20:39.494 align:middle line:90%


01:20:39.494 --> 01:20:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever the Dharma has
migrated to a new culture,

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
it has changed.

01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But so has the culture,
often in significant ways.

01:20:49.570 --> 01:20:52.100 align:middle line:84%
One increasingly important
influence Buddhism

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
is having on modernity is
through research programs

01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:59.390 align:middle line:84%
into the effects of
meditation, being carried out

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
by psychologists
and neuroscientists

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
with the active support and
encouragement of the Dalai

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Lama.

01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> At MIT meeting, we had 1,000
scientists in the audience,

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:13.680 align:middle line:90%
five Nobel Prize.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
His Holiness gave
the opening address

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
to the neuroscience meeting,
25,000 neuroscientists.

01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
There were 600 people
who are against it.

01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And when the door opened, they
were running to the first row.

01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And Richard Davidson
said, in 20 years,

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I never saw any
address [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
where people were running.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.080 align:middle line:90%
So there's something there.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, compared to 20 years
ago, it's is a gigantic step.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> To a very large extent,
cognitive scientists have not

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
been that open or willing to
question their own assumptions.

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they just
ignore evidence that

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
contradicts their very
cherished metaphysical beliefs.

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.640 align:middle line:90%
So that has to go.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And Buddhists have to
overcome-- we Buddhists have

01:21:58.130 --> 01:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to overcome our own sense
of dogmatism and complacency

01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:03.210 align:middle line:90%
in our own assumptions.

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we can do that
and come together

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.345 align:middle line:84%
with an open-minded,
radically empirical way

01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:10.220 align:middle line:84%
where we're willing to
be critical of our own

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
assumptions, a
whole new discipline

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
could arise that would have
implications for ethics,

01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:18.085 align:middle line:84%
for mental health, understanding
the mind, consciousness,

01:22:18.085 --> 01:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and the role of consciousness
in the natural world.

01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The Buddhist
scientific tradition,

01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhist psychological
meditational tradition,

01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and the Buddhist ethical
and political tradition,

01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
those services that the insider
community offered to the many

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:37.400 align:middle line:84%
societies in which
it was found useful,

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.060 align:middle line:84%
is offering it to
the planet today.

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is essential to
the planet's survival.

01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:44.360 align:middle line:84%
That will reinforce the good
aspects of all the world

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
religions without
competing with them.

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It will reinforce the good
aspects of secular humanism.

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.190 align:middle line:84%
It will reinforce
the good aspects

01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
of scientific investigation
of the nature of reality,

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
both internal, psychological,
mental reality,

01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as external
physical reality.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is of great essence,
actually, in the world.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Not as a religion,
and not as a religious

of the world,

service offering and
service accessing
