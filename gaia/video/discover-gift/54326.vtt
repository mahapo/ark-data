>>From the earliest days
that I could remember,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
my mind was constantly capturing
the frame, the broad expanse

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of sky and the mountains of
Vermont that I grew up on,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:84%
watching the animals,
becoming part of nature.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But what I really wanted
to do was make films.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:10%
So off to the big
city I went to study

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:10%
motion picture,
television, business.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The streets of New York
became my greatest coach

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and my friends, my
family, my best teachers.

I had a lot of fun.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:90%
I won awards on MTV.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I directed music videos
for Grammy winning artists.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I made my first
independent feature film.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I ran my own production
company and was fully immersed

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:90%
in being a filmmaker.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:84%

I had supermodel girlfriends
to go with my super-sized ego.

I got into all the best
parties and hung out

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:90%
with the coolest people.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't satisfied.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:90%
There was something missing.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.676 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Hollywood,
took it to the next level,

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
big movies, big stars.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't get me wrong, it
was a very good time.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And I really believed
this would be

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
the thing that
finally made me happy.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.464 align:middle line:90%

it or how hard I tried,

something profound was

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what it was.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to wonder if
filmmaking was my gift.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I didn't
have any real gift.

But in reality, as we evolve,
as we become more conscious,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:10%
we discover that this life
force or this life presence

contains flowers

of many different varieties,
we are all different varieties

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
of this god-consciousness that's
manifest in physical form.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that we come
from that and that we're

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
returning to that, we can't
be anything less than that.

to the top of the mountain

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.054 align:middle line:10%
for a moment, just to
show you what's there.

00:06:23.054 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to go back
to the bottom of the mountain

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:90%
and you have to climb.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:84%
If you take away the
humanity of the journey,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.402 align:middle line:84%
you take away part of what
is, to me, most beautiful.

had no relationship with the
closest living woman, blood

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:10%

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.918 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't like
each other at that time.

00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%

We hadn't really communicated

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:10%
And if you put us
in a room together,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:10%
there was going to be an all
out verbal and, at some point,

>>And I got the phone
call, surprisingly,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
because truthfully,
at that point,

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to
communicate with him anymore.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>I finally was able to let go
of all the issues that I had

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:90%
and call my sister.

>>He called.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:90%

Is Tata OK?

So the first thing
she said was who died?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:90%
I said nobody's dead.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.864 align:middle line:90%

And he said, I really
want to talk to you.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I need to ask your forgiveness.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>I said something's died.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I said what has
died is the anger

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
within my own soul towards
you, which was really

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
anger towards myself for
having abandoned you,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.052 align:middle line:90%
as your bigger brother.

00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>And that just stunned me.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
know what to do

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
with that, because it was
the last thing I was ever

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
expecting, ever, was for my
brother to call me and say,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:90%
can you ever forgive me?

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
All I ever wanted
was to say, yes.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So of course, immediately, I
said, yes, and what's going on?

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:90%
And I love you, Demian.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I love you, too.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really, really
sorry for everything.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>And I told her,
in that moment,

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, from today forth, I
will never, ever, ever raise

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:90%
my voice to you again.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
From now and until
the day I die,

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
when you want to know what that
bright light on your shoulder

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.292 align:middle line:84%
is, it's your brother,
baby, and I got your back.

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>And that was like the
happiest day of my life

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.620 align:middle line:84%
that I had experienced
to that day.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Because my life had
just been going away.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.996 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I thought
was solid and real

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:90%
in life kept leaving.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, yes.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And we cried on the phone,
together, for a long time.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never forget it.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>And the power of that
moment, the vibrational shift

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:84%
in energy, between my sister,
Shajen Joy, and her brother,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Demian, was so profound that
that vibration permeated out

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:90%
into our entire family.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And our entire family
stopped fighting.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>And I just wanted to
be there, with my brother

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and be in the forgiveness
with him, and be together.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:90%
And he said, let's be a family.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:90%
I want to be connected.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yes.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
I want to be connected, too.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:90%
I've been waiting.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so excited.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And that then began
another life for me,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
which was a life of being
connected to my family.

everything within my being

And if I could do
that there, then it

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
was possible that I could expand
that realm of consciousness

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:90%
to the next realm.

And if I could
take it from there

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.045 align:middle line:84%

>>Well if an individual really
wants to discover their gift,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
they have to ask, what is

What power is trying to become

00:12:57.489 --> 00:12:59.155 align:middle line:84%
Many people aren't
asking that question.

00:12:59.155 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:10%
They're just asking,
how can I avoid pain,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.395 align:middle line:10%
how can I get more
stuff, how can I fit in

00:13:06.395 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:10%
to the society in
which I'm living, how

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:10%
can I become successful?

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps their
model of success

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
been handed down

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:84%
to them by a high tech, low
touch, consumer driven society.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But when you ask, how
could I become more myself,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
how can I share my gifts, how
could I activate my potential?

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Now you begin to activate the
spiritual faculties within you

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to
hear the inaudible

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and to ultimately
see the invisible.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Because you're pulling
yourself out of the world.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
You're pulling yourself
into an interior awareness

We're guided by our
soul's desire to unfold.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:10%
>>I remember growing up feeling
like I didn't belong this

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:10%
on this planet, like
I was an anomaly.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:10%
And I remember feeling just
so alone and so disconnected

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:10%
and so sad.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And then that escalated to
a point of feeling angry,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
like something had to shift,
something had to change.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And from that space is
where I began to search.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I had like this
inner knowing that I

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
was destined for more than
what was showing up in my life.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I just hadn't trusted it before.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So I started tuning
in to that and asking

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:90%
questions, deep questions.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.835 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:14:35.835 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Like who am I really?

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:90%
And what's my purpose here?

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed that when I
asked disempowering questions,

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:84%
like why is this happening to
me, I would experience pain.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But when I asked those
higher vibrational questions,

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
like what am I grateful for,
you know, who do I love,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
or how can I serve, amazing
opportunities would come

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and amazing gifts
would be revealed.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.772 align:middle line:84%
So it was from that
receptive place

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:07.896 align:middle line:90%
that began with a question.

00:15:07.896 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The quality of our
lives is directly

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:84%
proportionate to the quality
of the questions that we ask.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.675 align:middle line:90%
We create as we speak.

00:15:23.675 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:10%
>>The closer I am onto
the frequency of what

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm supposed to be doing,
the more perfect life

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:10%
is, the more synchronistic
things happen, the more

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:10%
love and laughter I experience,
and the more fun I have.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:10%
>>The only way that the
highest good can manifest,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:10%
through our life
experience, is when

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:10%
we are delving into
this radio station

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:10%
that this gift resides in.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>What most of us
do, unfortunately,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
because of the way we're
educated, by our parents

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and by school and
by the military,

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is we lose touch
with that essence.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.227 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up at the top
of the ladder, 50 years later,

00:16:27.227 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:84%
only to discover you
have the ladder leaning

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:90%
against a long wall.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:90%
You've wasted your life.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Not to discover
your gift is to die

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%
with the music inside of you.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>If we don't give the gift,
we're killing ourselves.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
We are atrophying our heart
and our soul and living life

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:84%
on a survival level, which has
a tremendous amount of anxiety,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:90%
fear.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Fear-based living leads
to terrible decisions,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:90%
destruction, hurt, anger.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Long lasting happiness
can only come

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:90%
when we're sharing our gift.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:10%
>>And if you're
holding that gift back,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:10%
then what you're
asking is you're

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:10%
asking the world, the
other people in it,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:10%
to hold their gifts
back from you.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So you don't get to participate
in this magnificent life

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:90%
that we all have.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:90%
You're holding back.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The more you give
your gift, the more

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that you participate and make
a difference in the world,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
the more the world will
make a difference for you.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>So very practically, we have
to wake up every single day

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:84%
asking, what's trying
to emerge in me today?

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:84%
What gift is trying to
activate itself in me today?

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
What power is trying to
become itself in me today?

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And if the question
is sincere enough

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and the love is real
enough, the universe

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:90%
will reveal its secrets to us.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>When you start
off on your path,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
one of the very first
things you notice

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
is that the biggest
obstacle you have is you.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
For me, I definitely had
a flash of transformation.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I had the big breakthrough
moment with my sister.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:90%
I popped into a new world.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, I felt alive.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I felt connected to everything.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I could see, touch,
smell, hear things

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I could never perceive
before and marveled

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:84%
at the wonders of
life and suddenly

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:84%
thought I knew
something about nature

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:90%
and god and the divine spirit.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I experienced
the unveiling

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
of a system of
harmonious principles,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
eight distinct,
universal, spiritual laws,

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
all working together in a
unified field of consciousness.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:84%
They were coming in fast--
receptivity, intention,

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.122 align:middle line:84%
interaction, feedback,
vibration, gratitude,

00:19:08.122 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:90%
compassion, and unity.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And for a brief moment,
I glimpsed infinity,

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:90%
and it all became clear.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And in this space, every bad
habit and overblown piece

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
of my ego came rushing
back in to fill

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
the void of the new
space I had just created.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was
back to square one--

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:84%
or worse, because now I knew
that unified field existed.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted this
transformation to last,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:90%
I was going to have to earn it.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I was going to have
to work for it.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:10%
I was going to have to go after
it like my life depended on it.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.135 align:middle line:10%
And to me, it did.

00:19:48.135 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:10%
My friend, Chet
Holmes, introduced me

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:10%
to Michael and Sydney
Cresci, two incredible people

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:10%
who would change
my life forever.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:10%
They were hosting a symposium
on consciousness, attended

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:10%
by authors,
motivational speakers,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:10%
and transformational leaders
from around the world.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:10%
They had come together to
embark on an epic journey

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:10%
into the frontier of what is
possible in personal growth,

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:10%
and how each of us to make a
difference in our own lives

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:10%
and on the planet.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:10%
They shared from their hearts
a lifetime worth of knowledge.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was ready.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I was ready for something.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:84%
But I was totally
unprepared for the adventure

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that was about to begin.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:10%
>>The human mind really creates
everything that happens to you.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:10%
It looks like it's been
created by something out there.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It's being created
inside your head.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
What you pay attention to, what
you decide to pay attention to

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:84%
has a huge effect on
what happens to you

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and what you create
in your life.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
You're creating your
own reality by deciding

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
what to pay attention
to for instance.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't get
is that that is a choice.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>We live in a universe
of infinite possibilities

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that responds to the
power of our thoughts.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Our neurology, like our
nervous system and our brain,

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
can't take in infinite
possibilities.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like way too
much information.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It would be like trying to
download the whole internet.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So what we do and
how our mind works

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
is that it sorts through
infinite possibilities,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and it picks up just
a tiny little bit.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So it sorts and sifts,
and, in that process,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
it deletes some things
then makes generalizations.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And that tiny little
bit that we pick up

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is what harmonizes with
our deepest beliefs

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and our values and
our programming.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>There have been
many conversations

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
in the recent years about what
you focus on, you attract,

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and what happens in
your life is because

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:90%
of what you think about.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:90%
And that is absolutely true.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
What happens after we
think about something

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:90%
is a certain energy is created.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And it is created
not only in our body

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
but in our personal
space, in our reality.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And a certain reality then
unfolds because of thoughts

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs that
we hold in place.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:10%
>>What you think
about comes about.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.381 align:middle line:10%
What is your main,
dominant thoughtform?

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:10%
That tells you who
you're going to become.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:10%
If you want to know who you're
going to be five years from now

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.204 align:middle line:10%
or five minutes
from now, tell me

00:22:34.204 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:10%
what your dominant
thoughtform is,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:10%
and I'll tell you
where you are moving

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.074 align:middle line:10%
or how you're staying stagnant.

00:22:41.074 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Most people are not
directing their mind

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:90%
in an intentional way.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.920 align:middle line:90%
It's running on autopilot.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So the person whose
life is not working

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:84%
is unconsciously
and unintentionally

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:90%
thinking in a certain way.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:10%
And that thinking
then directly leads

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:10%
to a certain result in life.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And because they don't
see the connection,

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:10%
they continue to do it.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>People sabotage themselves
a lot with negative thinking.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.972 align:middle line:10%
When people are feeling
angry or depressed,

00:23:12.972 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:10%
it's usually because they're
thinking about something

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:10%
in the past, something that
they have no control over.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you are in
the present, that's

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:84%
where you do have control over
your thoughts, your actions,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:90%
how you're feeling.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And to get that there's
that shift inside.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
feeling negative,

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
you're doing that to yourself.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a thought that comes
down and creates that feeling.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:10%
>>We get in our own way,
because we hold past memories,

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.470 align:middle line:10%
we hold onto regrets.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:84%
We had people that tell us,
you're never going to make it.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, we've
all had experiences.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to do to
be happy is let those go.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Let the past go.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Release what is stopping
us from our own happiness.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.628 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.628 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:10%
>>A lot of people live
their entire lives

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:10%
at the effect of
everything around them.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:10%
They don't see their
life as something

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:10%
that they can make happen.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:10%
They see their life as
something that happens to them.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:10%
>>Any time you catch
yourself blaming, justifying

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:10%
your actions, making
someone else wrong,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:10%
or trying to be
right, or defending,

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:10%
these are examples
that illuminate

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:10%
that you're in effect.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can't
discover your gifts

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
when you're on the effect
side of the equation

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
because you're not really
present to your power.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to be accomplished,
and I wanted to be successful.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had a
little secret, which

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
was that I really
wanted to be a mother,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and I really wanted
to get married,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and I really wanted
to have a family.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:06.184 align:middle line:84%
But I thought I couldn't have
that life and my career, too.

00:25:06.184 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I thought that I
was going to have

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:90%
to choose one or the other.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:90%
I was conflicted.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:90%
And I felt paralyzed.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>In the Webster's
Dictionary, it

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
says consciousness means to
be aware of what we are doing

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.804 align:middle line:10%
And if you're not aware,
you can't make choices.

00:25:24.804 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:10%
If you're not aware
of what you're

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:10%
doing in the moment
and the impact

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:10%
that's having, we
don't have choices.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're not aware that you
say something you contract,

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a choice
to do it differently.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.087 align:middle line:84%
If you don't notice that you
did that and it fills you up,

00:25:38.087 --> 00:25:39.795 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a choice
to keep doing it.

00:25:39.795 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:90%
It was just an accident.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.550 align:middle line:90%
So you can't get better at it.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:90%
You can't make it a practice.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
aware it's a choice,

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:90%
or you can't make the choice.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>And then I remembered
every moment is a gift.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
called the present.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.635 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I
realized that, I saw

00:25:58.635 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that everything that I wanted
was right in front of me.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.934 align:middle line:84%
So I gave myself
permission to choose both.

00:26:04.934 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:10%
>>When people
develop the awareness

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:10%
to look inside the
mind and notice

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:10%
that, when I believe this,
certain things happen, I

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.190 align:middle line:10%
feel a certain way, I
behave a certain way,

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:10%
I attract certain people
and situations into my life.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Once people get clear on
that and exercise choice

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
at each of these junctures, the
world starts to unfold for you.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, the very
interesting thing about our mind

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.496 align:middle line:84%
is when our mind is calm and
collected and it's focused,

00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:46.060 align:middle line:84%
it gets enormous
energy, enormous power

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.260 align:middle line:84%
of manifesting its
own intentions.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And human nature is such, you
can't but look for something.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:00.522 align:middle line:84%
The quest is very natural to a
developed mind, the human mind.

00:27:00.522 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:90%
We want to know things.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:90%
We want to know how things are.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So to know what is
this is science.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And to know who am
I is spirituality.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And they're so complimentary

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>In order to change reactive
thought to proactive thought,

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.247 align:middle line:84%
you first have to become
aware of your thoughts.

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you watch
your thoughts for long,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you start to notice, all
day long, these thoughts

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.539 align:middle line:90%
are just coming.

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
you're watching them.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.004 align:middle line:90%
They're not you.

00:28:10.004 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:10%
They're just-- a part
of you is creating them,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:10%
called your mind and your ego.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to see the fear
and the doubt and the judgments

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.174 align:middle line:84%
and just watch it neutrally,
it almost becomes comical.

00:28:21.174 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize
you're not your thoughts.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:90%
You can observe your thoughts.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And once you get to that
place-- I have a mind,

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not my mind,
I have an intellect,

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not my intellect, I'm
this pure center of awareness

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.737 align:middle line:84%
and choice-- now I see I
can choose the thoughts that

00:28:35.737 --> 00:28:36.945 align:middle line:90%
will take where I want to go.

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:10%
I can choose the thoughts that
will support my dreams, that

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:10%
will uplift me and my
family and humanity.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:10%
Then you become intentional
with your thoughts.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.432 align:middle line:10%
>>If you have a dominant
thoughtform that's

00:28:47.432 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:10%
dysfunctional, all
you've got to do

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:10%
is think a little bit
better thought, then

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:10%
a little bit better
thought, then

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.746 align:middle line:10%
a little bit better thought.

00:28:52.746 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And you start to change.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small,
slight change.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.282 align:middle line:84%
But little changes
are big changes.

00:29:00.282 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>You can do something that's
not resourceful, over and over,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:84%
as long as you do
it unconsciously.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it with
awareness, really watching,

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:84%
knowing where it's going,
if it's not resourceful,

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:90%
you cannot keep doing it.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.780 align:middle line:10%
>>You have to spend some time
to release the conditioning

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.170 align:middle line:10%
that you've been given.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:10%
It's not an overnight process.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:10%
Research shows it takes 30 days
of uninterrupted discipline

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:10%
to get a new habit
into your life.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a new
habit of thinking,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
a new habit of behavior,
like flossing your teeth.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:84%
It can be a new
paradigm you believe in.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And so if you hold
this new thought,

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
if you do this new exercise,
whatever it might be,

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.451 align:middle line:84%
to reclaim the
essence of who you are

00:29:42.451 --> 00:29:44.784 align:middle line:84%
and release all the negative
blocks that you've taken on

00:29:44.784 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:84%
over the years,
then you naturally

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:90%
step into who you are.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
You naturally express your gift.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.440 align:middle line:90%
This is not hard.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:51.980 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>A veil had been lifted.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.593 align:middle line:10%
I could see that I had
never truly chosen my life.

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.715 align:middle line:10%
I had been living
out of alignment

00:30:05.715 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:10%
with the spiritual
laws of the universe.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Just behind the surface
of physical reality,

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:84%
the laws are always
flowing, always creating,

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.610 align:middle line:90%
always interacting.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn to focus my
intention to connect with them.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize that who I
am is an emerging possibility.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:84%
There was an entire,
new direction

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.405 align:middle line:84%
that my life was taking, and I
was just beginning to sense it.

00:30:37.405 --> 00:30:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
In the darkness of
night, one candle

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:90%
can be seen from miles away.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.925 align:middle line:84%
It was time for me to
light my own candle.

00:30:56.925 --> 00:31:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:10%
I, myself, have been
on a consistent journey

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:10%
to uncover who I am, to get
in touch with who I'm being.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:10%
I think I've walked the planet
for a long time as a very

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:10%
arrogant and self-centered
and righteous ass.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And now that I know
that, I'm experiencing

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
freedom around it.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So that has definitely
been the first step.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:84%
The next step is to actually--
is to actively seek out

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:84%
people and places
and masters of being,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:48.270 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that can
coach me into a higher

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:84%
level of understanding
and consciousness,

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:84%
to be more present
to the gifts that

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:84%
are available in every
moment, every waking hour,

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and to breathe more.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:90%
I've been breathing a lot more.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:05.511 align:middle line:90%


00:32:05.511 --> 00:32:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:10%
>>Then you want to
discover the gift

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:10%
that nature has given to you.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:37.600 align:middle line:10%
First thing is we must
stop blaming ourself.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Self-blame is the biggest
obstruction for one

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.320 align:middle line:90%
to recognize one's gift.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.390 align:middle line:10%
>>It'll stop you
every time from being

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:10%
able to live the life that
you were meant to live.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.120 align:middle line:10%
It's thoughts like,
who do I think I am?

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm not beautiful enough.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not smart enough.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not rich enough.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not educated enough.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the right color.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
When you let those things
drive your life, they do.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.315 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.315 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:10%
>>There's a reason why some
people can't figure out

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.622 align:middle line:10%
what they want.

00:33:10.622 --> 00:33:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And it's because, when
they were growing up,

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:10%
their parents never let them
decide on what they wanted.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Every time they were about
to decide on something they

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:84%
wanted, their parents
would jump in and say,

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.680 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no, you don't want that.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:90%
You want this.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Or you can't have that,
but you can have this.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And they never allowed the child
to experiment on small things,

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.860 align:middle line:84%
with wanting things, seeing
what happens when you get them

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and seeing, perhaps
experimenting,

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:84%
with different ways
of getting them.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when they grow up,
they have no confidence.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't trust their
own wanter, you might say.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Because they've never used it.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Because every time they
decided to want something,

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.990 align:middle line:84%
somebody told them it was
wrong or they couldn't have it

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:84%
or there was some
reason no, no, no.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
do it that way.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.345 align:middle line:84%
>>Some people never get into
that passionate experience

00:33:58.345 --> 00:34:00.702 align:middle line:84%
and know that
that's it for them.

00:34:00.702 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:10%
Because we find a
lot of people take

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:10%
on a life that's not their
own, at which they can never

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.930 align:middle line:10%
succeed.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.630 align:middle line:10%
And what we mean by that
is they take on the life

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.580 align:middle line:10%
that their parents
planned for them,

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:10%
or they rebel against
the life their parents

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.800 align:middle line:10%
planned for them, depending
on their persuasion.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:90%
By the way, it's not their life.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:84%
Or they took on a life
that the church decreed

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.980 align:middle line:84%
for them or the politic
decreed for them.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
They've never
really got in touch

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:90%
with their own experience.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.659 align:middle line:84%
>>We all have very
different abilities.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.020 align:middle line:90%
We have very different talents.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.670 align:middle line:90%
We have very different gifts.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:84%
And most school systems are
designed to ignore them.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is, with
the education system,

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.060 align:middle line:10%
is that it's a system.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's a system that's
based on the principles

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.409 align:middle line:10%
of manufacturing
and industrialism.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:84%
The idea is if you
keep with the program

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and you do everything
that's required of you,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:84%
you'll pop out the far end,
and you'll be qualified.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can carry
on and lead a life

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that will be
profitable and secure.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And none of that is true.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's not true because
human life is not linear.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.420 align:middle line:10%
Human life is organic.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.225 align:middle line:10%
And human life is
not standardized.

00:35:08.225 --> 00:35:09.225 align:middle line:10%
And it's not conformist.

00:35:09.225 --> 00:35:13.256 align:middle line:84%
It's diverse and extraordinarily
rich and various.

00:35:13.256 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But for all kinds of
reasons, not least

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.539 align:middle line:84%
of which is education,
we're socialized

00:35:18.539 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
certain types of ability

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.580 align:middle line:84%
are more important than
all other sorts of ability.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's why so many people
think they don't have any.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.678 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
discover them.

00:35:26.678 --> 00:35:29.430 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.510 align:middle line:10%
>>A lot of us
discount what we have

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:10%
to offer because we
can't see how it's

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.040 align:middle line:10%
going to make us money, or it's
not going to make us famous,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:10%
or we're not going to get
invited to be on "Oprah."

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we feel like we're
not making a difference.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Making a difference is
not about a project.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the way you show up in
the world every single day.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.795 align:middle line:84%
You are already
making a difference.

00:35:56.795 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Whether you know it or not,
whether you like it or not,

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
just by your presence,
your vibrational presence

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:90%
is always making a difference.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:84%
You made a difference
today, to everyone

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:84%
who saw you, felt
you, or heard you.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So the question then is, what
kind of difference am I making?

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't measure it
in terms of money.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't measure in terms of fame.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't measure it in terms
of even how many people

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.640 align:middle line:90%
you've affected.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Shifting one person is sacred.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>>If people looked for their
gift, they would find it.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:10%
But the world has
mesmerized each of us

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:10%
to some extent and degree.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It has hypnotized
us if you will.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The world says power
is in status symbols.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
The power is in the position
that you hold in the world.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:84%
The power is in what kind
of automobile you drive,

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.090 align:middle line:84%
what kind of
neighborhood you live in.

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.995 align:middle line:90%
That's where the power is.

00:36:54.995 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:90%
The power is in the money.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:90%
When the power is in you.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's in me.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But you'll never
find it if your eyes

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:84%
are stuck on someone else's
gift on the television.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.740 align:middle line:84%
If you're eyes are agaze
at someone else, who's

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.895 align:middle line:84%
living their dream, what
about you and your dream?

00:37:15.895 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Choose in favor
of your passion.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Choose in favor
of the things that

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.700 align:middle line:90%
have greatest meaning to you.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Your passions are
like bread crumbs

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:84%
that lead you onto
the path of your gift.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And know that every
moment is a choice.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're either choosing
closer to your gift

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.440 align:middle line:84%
or moving farther away from
it, in every single moment.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.373 align:middle line:90%
So what do you want to choose?

00:37:42.373 --> 00:37:50.590 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:10%
>>The secret of
life is finding out

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:55.250 align:middle line:10%
what you love to do,
developing a deliberate

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.967 align:middle line:10%
practice to get
really good at it.

00:37:56.967 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:10%
And that's the foundation
that will lead you

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.690 align:middle line:10%
on a serendipitous
journey to riches

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:10%
beyond your wildest imagination.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:10%
One of these days, you'll
find the thing to do.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>What you love and
are interested in

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:90%
is a clue to what your gift is.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you love
will evolve as you do.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:10%
But what I know
for each person is

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:10%
that there is, as unique
as our thumbprint,

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.989 align:middle line:10%
that wonderous
thing that is ours.

00:38:21.989 --> 00:38:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And you will begin to find
it by paying attention

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.370 align:middle line:90%
to what you love.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice, also, that
when you're in your gift,

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:31.810 align:middle line:84%
you feel more alive, you
feel more passionate,

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.005 align:middle line:84%
you feel as if I
was born for this.

00:38:35.005 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.840 align:middle line:10%
>>When you start to tap
into who you really are,

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to make
yourself be happy.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.950 align:middle line:10%
You just get happy.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:10%
You feel trusting.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:84%
You feel like that
voice of the soul,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:84%
as it starts to come
through, is always perfect.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.190 align:middle line:90%
It unveils your path for you.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It brings you what you need.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It connects you with
everyone you need.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.240 align:middle line:10%
>>You know it's your gift
when it's effortless.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.950 align:middle line:10%
You know it's your
gift when it's natural,

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:12.910 align:middle line:10%
when it feels
beautiful and simple.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And everybody
already knows that.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of remembering.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.442 align:middle line:84%
>>It's about finding
your true spirit.

00:39:20.442 --> 00:39:22.150 align:middle line:10%
And you know you've
found it, in the way,

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.580 align:middle line:10%
because time changes for you.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:10%
If you're doing something
that doesn't resonate properly

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.530 align:middle line:10%
with you, five minutes
can feel like an hour.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing
the thing that really

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:84%
is part of your being,
that is coming from you,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.130 align:middle line:84%
then an hour can feel
like five minutes.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:10%
>>As you activate your
gift into the world,

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:10%
you get that
momentum behind you.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You never know what the
light has in store for you.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:84%
You never know what that
maximum level looks like.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
no maximum level.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:00.420 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps scaling up,
higher and higher and higher.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep touching
more and more people.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And that momentum and
that inspirational power

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:90%
keeps flowing through you.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And then that drives you to
go even deeper and deeper

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:90%
into your gift.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:14.417 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that
is the source of genius.

00:40:14.417 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>At different
times in your life,

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:84%
you may have different
gifts to discover.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Your gift, when
you're younger, might

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.770 align:middle line:84%
be that you're
going to be a mother

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and put all of your energy
into being a mother.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And the gift is of
love, of nurturing.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:42.730 align:middle line:84%
At some point, because
we are individuals

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.500 align:middle line:84%
who are growing and changing
and shifting all the time,

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.330 align:middle line:84%
whether we know it
or not, that gift

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.260 align:middle line:84%
might not feel big
enough for you anymore.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:90%
You might have outgrown it.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You might feel there's
something else calling to you.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.320 align:middle line:84%
This can be a moment of a
lot of crisis for people,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
because we feel, but this
is what I chose to do.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be a full-time mom.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Or I wanted to be a lawyer.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Or I wanted to be an artist.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, it's
not fulfilling me.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with those moments.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:90%
It means that you have shifted.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You've morphed into
something else.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.970 align:middle line:10%
And that based on the foundation
of all that you've learned

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.980 align:middle line:10%
and all you've become, something
more is wanting to be born.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.740 align:middle line:84%
These are times when we have
to be really courageous,

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.340 align:middle line:84%
sometimes let go of things
that we've defined ourself by,

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and be willing to be rebirthed
into someone and something new

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.268 align:middle line:84%
and discover the new
gift inside of you.

00:41:40.268 --> 00:41:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.785 align:middle line:10%
>>If you've not
gotten that gift.

00:41:46.785 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:10%
If you're still looking
and searching out there,

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.484 align:middle line:10%
you've got to look
into your life

00:41:50.484 --> 00:41:52.970 align:middle line:10%
and go, what would
I do no matter what?

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.440 align:middle line:84%
If the world blew up,
what would I do anyway?

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.280 align:middle line:84%
If I lost my family, what would
I do, every day, for free?

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:84%
What would I do without
any remuneration?

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.320 align:middle line:84%
What would I do as
a nonprofit charity?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask yourself
that question enough,

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and particularly if you meditate
on that question long enough,

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's inevitable
that you will find your gift.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the main
thing you could

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:84%
do to discover your own gift
is to look inside and say

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.600 align:middle line:90%
what brings me the greatest joy?

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.669 align:middle line:84%
What has been the thing that
when I do it, I'm happiest?

00:42:27.669 --> 00:42:29.210 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
what brings you joy,

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.251 align:middle line:84%
it takes you back into
the essence of who you are

00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and what you're meant to do.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.925 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to listen to
a rock and roll station.

00:42:34.925 --> 00:42:38.490 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to hear your
body, to hear your intuition,

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.200 align:middle line:84%
to hear God's voice, if you
will, speaking through you.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:84%
It's always called the
still, small voice within.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Specific practices
to find your gift-- one

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.930 align:middle line:90%
would be practice more solitude.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Many people are afraid to
be alone with themselves.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But it is in the
silence of your own soul

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.420 align:middle line:90%
that your inner voice speaks.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.340 align:middle line:10%
And you're able
to hear and follow

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:06.110 align:middle line:10%
the voice as it directs you

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:09.810 align:middle line:10%
>>Solitude will take you places.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:15.590 align:middle line:10%
Go into the woods, go and
bathe yourself in the stream.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.193 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the birds sing.

00:43:17.193 --> 00:43:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Go to the ocean waves
and just hear the music.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.470 align:middle line:10%
The world, the universe
is talking to you.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.530 align:middle line:90%


00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Another specific
that you can do

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:39.830 align:middle line:84%
is to practice loving yourself,
giving yourself permission

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:84%
to live your dreams, give
yourself permission to be well,

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
give yourself
permission to be OK,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
give yourself permission to
be forgiven for past mistakes,

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.820 align:middle line:84%
give yourself permission
to start over.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:90%
All of these are acts of love.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm in Rome, and I'm on the
phone with my sister, Shajen.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So I get a call from
my sister, Shajen.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was a pretty
profound call,

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.410 align:middle line:84%
because what she
said was, when is

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the work you're doing
in the world going

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.040 align:middle line:90%
to match the man I know?

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.560 align:middle line:90%
When's that going to happen?

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you're really
good at blowing things up.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have a
lot of fun doing it,

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:33.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a match
for who you've become.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it
was a great question.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I really had
to think about it.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:39.199 align:middle line:90%
And she was right.

00:44:39.199 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Because on one level, I was
over here making the Hollywood

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:48.130 align:middle line:84%
movies and trying so hard
to get something that

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.110 align:middle line:84%
was all about the next,
biggest thing I could do.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't about who I was being.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.515 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly I had my answer.

00:44:57.515 --> 00:44:59.950 align:middle line:90%
It was right in front of me.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.620 align:middle line:84%
It had been there
the entire time.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So my purpose is clear, to
share all these amazing people

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and the things that I've learned
with the rest of the world.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just one of
many people that's

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.980 align:middle line:84%
experiencing this awakening,
this rise in consciousness.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>As we activate our potential,
bliss, ecstasy, happiness,

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and joy is in the
giving of the gift.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.860 align:middle line:10%
Because my priority is sharing.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.590 align:middle line:10%
My priority is giving.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.570 align:middle line:10%
My priority is
releasing life energy.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.880 align:middle line:10%
My priority is radiating.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.380 align:middle line:90%
So my priority isn't getting.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if I go
to getting, now I

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.200 align:middle line:84%
resist the very
thing that I want.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm on, now, a precipice
of becoming more myself.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm available to more
good than I've ever

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.750 align:middle line:84%
imagined to come
forward in my life.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not under the illusion
that I know what that good is.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, transformation can occur.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And we always know
it's transformation

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.005 align:middle line:90%
because it surprises us.

00:46:22.005 --> 00:46:24.480 align:middle line:10%
If it doesn't surprise you,
it's not transformation.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.900 align:middle line:10%
>>When you start to
use your gift to serve,

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.540 align:middle line:10%
magic happens in your life.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It's greater than you
could have imagined.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like a soloist
becoming part of a band.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're part of a whole
choir of angels that are also

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.100 align:middle line:90%
in the same vibration right now.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.060 align:middle line:84%
The more you give, the more
things come back to you.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
what you really

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:84%
desire is more
opportunities to give.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.335 align:middle line:84%
And if that's what
you're wanting--

00:46:51.335 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:84%
that's what you're
really wanting

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.837 align:middle line:84%
is to serve and support,
you find yourself in Iraq.

00:46:56.837 --> 00:47:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:06.390 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself making
music in an ancient culture.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the most spiritual
feelings I've ever felt

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.640 align:middle line:84%
is that connection
between people I thought

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.595 align:middle line:90%
were my enemies and myself.

00:47:13.595 --> 00:47:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Well working in Iraq for
the last three years,

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.380 align:middle line:84%
when we would start
the drum circle,

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:84%
people often came
from different parts

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.620 align:middle line:84%
of Iraq, different
language groups

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.330 align:middle line:90%
and different religious groups.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So there would be an
initial resistance.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:42.289 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the layers
of resistance falling off

00:47:42.289 --> 00:47:43.080 align:middle line:90%
people's shoulders.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon,
over time, everyone

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.660 align:middle line:84%
came together playing
their own part,

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.650 align:middle line:84%
not making my music
or their music,

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:00.740 align:middle line:84%
but coming together and forming
something new, a new song.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was just playing
off each other's energy.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.448 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a great metaphor
for a beautiful way to live.

00:48:08.448 --> 00:48:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:84%
There is a duet that's being
called out in our culture

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.730 align:middle line:90%
right now, in our world.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.170 align:middle line:84%
To have the gift of
traveling the world

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and interacting with people
through music and sharing,

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.890 align:middle line:84%
really, our heart
vibrations across the world,

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.750 align:middle line:84%
it gives me great hope
for peace on the planet.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.790 align:middle line:10%
>>See anything we
do in our life,

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:10%
we do either expecting
some sort of happiness

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:49.650 align:middle line:10%
or we do as an
expression of joy.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:53.390 align:middle line:84%
To shift from this position
of expecting something

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:84%
to sharing what you can with
the world, with the people

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.080 align:middle line:84%
around you, makes
all the difference.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.815 align:middle line:90%
>>My name is Tatanka Mani.

00:49:22.815 --> 00:49:24.680 align:middle line:90%
It means Walking Buffalo.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.750 align:middle line:90%
My birth name is Andrew.

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm a sundancer
and a pipe carrier

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.675 align:middle line:84%
and a ceremonial leader
and just a common man.

00:49:32.675 --> 00:49:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.930 align:middle line:84%
People say that the gift
I have is to help people

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:46.260 align:middle line:90%
learn about themselves.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.910 align:middle line:84%
However, I did choose
to live a life that

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:56.030 align:middle line:84%
enhances that so that
it can be given back

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:59.090 align:middle line:84%
in a appropriate way,
in a respectful way,

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and in a traditional way, in a
way that only does good things.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't only
take in this world.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:90%
We always have to give back.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.060 align:middle line:84%
True gifts are the ones
that we receive and give

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.410 align:middle line:84%
back to the world in
whatever way is necessary.

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean as much
if we just hold on to it

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.330 align:middle line:90%
and keep it to ourselves.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It's often hard and
challenging to walk that line,

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.205 align:middle line:84%
to continually
work on these gifts

00:50:31.205 --> 00:50:32.935 align:middle line:90%
that each person is given.

00:50:32.935 --> 00:50:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
aren't willing to do that.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.732 align:middle line:84%
>>Why aren't people
willing to do that?

00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:40.565 align:middle line:90%
>>Because it's hard.

00:50:40.565 --> 00:50:53.660 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.160 align:middle line:10%
>>It's that commitment
to excellence

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.270 align:middle line:10%
that forces us to grow and that
commitment to not backing away

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:01.550 align:middle line:10%
when it's tough that the
real satisfaction, the deeper

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.410 align:middle line:10%
satisfaction comes from.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's the giving of our gift
where the fulfillment comes.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.920 align:middle line:84%
When you're out there serving
and people are receiving it

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and you've had to work
hard to make that happen,

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.403 align:middle line:84%
and then it just
blossoms in its fullness.

00:51:15.403 --> 00:51:17.194 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it gets
any better than that.

00:51:17.194 --> 00:51:27.090 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Here we are at
Refugio Altiplano.

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm Scott Peterson.

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I've lived here
for 12 years now.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.670 align:middle line:10%
I run a shamanic healing
center and integrative medicine

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:40.030 align:middle line:10%
center, where we heal
people with natural means.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:44.190 align:middle line:84%
People come to us from all over
the world for healing purposes,

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.640 align:middle line:84%
for guidance, and
also for learning.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
people, these days,

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:84%
are insulated from their
own spiritual lives.

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:56.570 align:middle line:84%
We have very little free
time, very little recreation.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We have very little
time to be alone.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.643 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
under the influence

00:52:01.643 --> 00:52:04.620 align:middle line:84%
of television,
antidepressant drugs,

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of very abrasive
people around them

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.280 align:middle line:90%
on a regular and constant basis.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And when they strip off
these negative influences,

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.620 align:middle line:84%
they inevitably will take
a certain transition period

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:19.650 align:middle line:84%
to come back into a state
of homeostasis and calm.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But from there, they
can begin to grow

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:25.110 align:middle line:84%
in a very positive
and real direction.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.470 align:middle line:84%
If you want to create a
positive environment that

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.990 align:middle line:84%
reflects your inner and higher
self, what you have to do

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:35.950 align:middle line:84%
is you have to always give
energy to the things you like

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and always take energy away
from the things you don't like.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>So when we're
giving, we're coming

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.560 align:middle line:90%
from a premise of abundance.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And that creates the space
for even more abundance

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.000 align:middle line:90%
to flow into our lives.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.940 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that you give
that you won't experience.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.910 align:middle line:10%
It's like if you give someone
a smile, you're smiling.

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:01.430 align:middle line:10%
You are feeling a smile.

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Or if you give them
the gift of laughter,

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.310 align:middle line:90%
you're the one that's laughing.

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Or if you give the
gift of love, you're

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:12.320 align:middle line:84%
feeling the love, because
it's flowing through you.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And as it flows through you,
it's like it comes back.

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.072 align:middle line:84%
It's in the giving
that we receive.

00:53:19.072 --> 00:53:22.250 align:middle line:10%
>>It's especially important
for all people, men and women,

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.580 align:middle line:10%
to acknowledge the warrior
side of their being.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when you don't
acknowledge that side,

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.870 align:middle line:90%
it comes out in unhealthy ways.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>The ingestation of
pizza manifestation--

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>As much pizza as possible.

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>All right, let's go, pizza.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.180 align:middle line:90%


00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.141 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:53:43.141 --> 00:53:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Ready.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:47.986 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, bang it up.

00:53:47.986 --> 00:53:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I look at anybody
famous or anyone

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.770 align:middle line:90%
who's achieved their goal.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:58.150 align:middle line:84%
They weren't that
when they were born.

00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Your left side's
dipping just a touch.

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:05.785 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the
line, they conceived

00:54:05.785 --> 00:54:08.180 align:middle line:84%
it, this vision of
themselves, whether it

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.000 align:middle line:84%
was singing or dancing
or playing football

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Then they believed
they could do it.

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.570 align:middle line:10%
And once you got
that belief-- and I

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:19.150 align:middle line:10%
think that's where
people get stuck.

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.733 align:middle line:10%
They conceive.

00:54:19.733 --> 00:54:22.080 align:middle line:10%
They have a conception
of what they like.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.740 align:middle line:10%
But they don't believe
that they can achieve it.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And that little
block, right there,

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.170 align:middle line:84%
in between first
and second gear,

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.196 align:middle line:84%
stays inside for their
whole, entire lives.

00:54:31.196 --> 00:54:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
talk to them when

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.810 align:middle line:84%
they were 80 or 90
or 100 years old

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're lying
on their deathbed,

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.390 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to say, I'm glad I

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:41.260 align:middle line:84%
stayed in this little shell
and never bursted out.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.650 align:middle line:90%
They're going to wish.

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They're just going to say,
phh, I should have done that.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Now why didn't I do that?

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.290 align:middle line:90%
I could've done it.

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:52.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word
"inspire" literally

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.230 align:middle line:90%
means to breathe in spirit.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you could do this for an
hour in the morning or an hour

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.200 align:middle line:84%
at night and carry
that spirit with you

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.120 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a
person who is truly

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:10.560 align:middle line:84%
in-spirit through inspiration
can accomplish anything

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.292 align:middle line:84%
they want and can
easily manifest anything

00:55:13.292 --> 00:55:15.180 align:middle line:90%
that they're trying to manifest.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Discovering your
gift is one thing.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Living it, that
is something else.

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It requires as much focus
and dedication as anything

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done.

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It is a challenge to
every fiber of my being

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.503 align:middle line:84%
to be in service to
what I am becoming.

00:55:43.503 --> 00:55:47.090 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:51.410 align:middle line:84%
The more I studied and
meditated on sharing my gifts,

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized that the
universal, spiritual laws

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I had experienced
were continuing

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:01.390 align:middle line:90%
to unfold within my being.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And once again, I awakened
to this unified field

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.990 align:middle line:84%
of awareness, where
everything was connected

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:12.620 align:middle line:84%
in perfect vibrational
harmony with everything else.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:16.290 align:middle line:84%
As I became open and receptive
to this infinite loop

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:21.190 align:middle line:84%
of energy, I realized that
the more I shared my gifts,

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.930 align:middle line:84%
the more it inspired others
to share their gifts.

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I was feeding them, and
they were feeding me.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:33.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a universal,
spiritual principle at work,

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:35.793 align:middle line:84%
the infinity feedback
loop of creation.

00:56:35.793 --> 00:56:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:46.290 align:middle line:10%
>>Giving a gift is part
of the sacred process

00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:50.470 align:middle line:10%
of sustaining the community
and sharing the wealth.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.100 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that's
really what lies

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:10%
behind this idea of
discovering your gift.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:57.610 align:middle line:84%
You're not discovering
it just for yourself,

00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:59.500 align:middle line:84%
but you're discovering
your gift so you

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.120 align:middle line:90%
can offer to other people.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And that, in offering
it to other people,

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.870 align:middle line:84%
you are building
a stronger sense

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:06.710 align:middle line:84%
of community between
yourself and the people

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:08.450 align:middle line:90%
that we share the Earth with.

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It's part of
contributing to and being

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.550 align:middle line:84%
part of the commonwealth
of humanity.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And in that respect,
discovering your own gifts

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.856 align:middle line:84%
is an act of being
selfless as well as

00:57:18.856 --> 00:57:19.980 align:middle line:90%
one of fulfilling yourself.

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:25.340 align:middle line:90%


00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.440 align:middle line:10%
>>Art has always been a gift.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.940 align:middle line:10%
And that's one of the reasons
why we place such a high value

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.560 align:middle line:10%
on paintings,
because they reveal

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:10%
what's inside,
what's underneath.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.735 align:middle line:10%
One of the gifts you have as
an artist is you feel more.

00:57:38.735 --> 00:57:40.520 align:middle line:10%
You see more.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.050 align:middle line:10%
You connect more.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:46.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
moments of my life

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.770 align:middle line:84%
is when I started to
discover my own gift.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Once my heart was
open and I began

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:56.480 align:middle line:84%
to discover that I was to be
an artist, after spending all

00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.340 align:middle line:84%
my adult life in business, it
was a profound realization.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked back in
time-- it's been 20 years now--

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful
that I didn't stay

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.310 align:middle line:84%
in what I thought
when I was young.

00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be an
architect or a business owner.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't stuck or married
to that for my whole life.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I began to change and
discover who and what I was.

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So one of my jobs, as a
teacher and as an artist,

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:29.210 align:middle line:84%
is to introduce people to the
heart and the heart chakra.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't found a
better way to practice

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:35.250 align:middle line:84%
opening your heart than in
the process of painting.

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:38.016 align:middle line:90%


00:58:38.016 --> 00:58:43.900 align:middle line:10%
>>I decided to sell our very
popular restaurant in Whistler

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:50.740 align:middle line:10%
and pursue my dreams
and work with children

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:53.122 align:middle line:10%
in the arts and crafts field.

00:58:53.122 --> 00:59:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I have over 200 children
that want to do art with me.

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.625 align:middle line:84%
I've never been so
poor financially,

00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:07.030 align:middle line:84%
but I've never been
so rich in my heart.

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.970 align:middle line:90%
It's filled the void.

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:12.838 align:middle line:84%
Because we were never
able to have children.

00:59:12.838 --> 00:59:20.630 align:middle line:90%


00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And now I have more
children in my life

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:24.590 align:middle line:90%
than anyone could ever ask for.

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:27.510 align:middle line:90%


00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to bring this
mandala back for the children

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:38.350 align:middle line:84%
to see that their art
never has to be perfect,

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:41.580 align:middle line:90%
that their are mistakes in here.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:45.762 align:middle line:90%
And I know they'll love it.

00:59:45.762 --> 00:59:47.899 align:middle line:84%
You can never have
too many sparkles.

00:59:47.899 --> 00:59:49.831 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:49.831 --> 00:59:54.090 align:middle line:90%


00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>There's something
here, but you

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.110 align:middle line:84%
can't get to it
through the mind.

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:00.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to get to
it through the heart.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:56.680 align:middle line:90%


01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Everything on this planet is
actually just a certain kind

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.570 align:middle line:84%
of vibration, vibrating
molecules, vibrating particles.

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:08.110 align:middle line:90%
This is physics.

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
spiritual physics here.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
And you are actually
just a vibrational being.

01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We are actually all vibrational
beings before anything else.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>We call ourself human
beings not human doings,

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
because what we're really
bringing into any situation

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:26.500 align:middle line:90%
is the quality of our being.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're being loving,
when we're being inclusive,

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
when we're being expressive,
when we're being joyful,

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:36.300 align:middle line:90%
that creates a vibration.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that vibration is what
we're really expressing.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.925 align:middle line:84%
It's the quality of the energy,
the enthusiasm or lack of it,

01:01:42.925 --> 01:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
the love or lack of it,
the anger or lack of it

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
that really has the most impact.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.165 align:middle line:84%
>>When you show
up, who shows up?

01:01:52.165 --> 01:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what you're thinking.

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:55.831 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
you want to say to people.

01:01:55.831 --> 01:01:58.157 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen is
they're going to feel you.

01:01:58.157 --> 01:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
They're going to feel
everything that you've

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
brought into that moment.

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And we can call
that your vibration.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:10.000 align:middle line:90%


01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.090 align:middle line:84%
If that vibration has
black, if it has anger,

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
if it has resentment, if it
has shame, if it has emotions--

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and all emotions are really just
vibrations-- if it has emotions

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that are not vibrating
at the highest

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
place, an expansive
place, you will actually

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:33.215 align:middle line:84%
push away things that are
trying to come to you.

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
You will actually
attract things that

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.419 align:middle line:84%
are vibrating with those
emotions of contracted

01:02:41.419 --> 01:02:41.918 align:middle line:90%
feelings.

01:02:41.918 --> 01:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>You need to look
in the mirror.

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You need to look
inside your own being

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
to discover where you're off in
your vibe, where your anger is

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
or where your despair is
or where your cynicism lies

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.155 align:middle line:90%
or where your resignation is.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And until you can begin to come
to terms with your own being,

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
difficult for you

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to be able to return that
vibration to the world.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a principal in music
called sympathetic vibration.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So that when I play
my drum, another drum

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.780 align:middle line:84%
is actually vibrating
at that same pitch.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And it will be played,
without anyone touching it.

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:29.686 align:middle line:84%
When we hear a pulse, we
can't help but join it.

01:03:29.686 --> 01:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Because, really,
the principle is

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.220 align:middle line:90%
that life wants to harmonize.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.366 align:middle line:84%
Every beat, every note we
make is felt somewhere.

01:03:37.366 --> 01:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>We're simply a vibration
held together into this form.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to
express ourselves

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and to experience
consciousness, to experience

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
this tactile world, to
eat, to love, to laugh,

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
to raise families, to
create grand edifices,

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:58.390 align:middle line:90%
to have art, music.

01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:59.510 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.502 align:middle line:90%

01:04:55.784 --> 01:04:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>The whole world is vibrations.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Everything is vibrations.

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:04.950 align:middle line:10%
And when happy and peaceful,
calm vibration emits from us,

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.160 align:middle line:10%
it draws similar
situations around us.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
When we connect with
the universal presence,

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:18.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, then our life becomes
a fertilized expression of joy.

01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Your life is just a mirror.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.870 align:middle line:10%
So when you put your
attention on those things

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:24.830 align:middle line:10%
that you're passionate
about, and then

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:27.390 align:middle line:10%
when you start to align with
those things, what you find

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:30.200 align:middle line:10%
is that the doors start to
open, the people, the places,

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.400 align:middle line:10%
or things start to show up.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And you become what I
call a passionate magnet.

01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just synchronicity
just starts to align itself.

>>We vibrate things
into our life.

01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:44.500 align:middle line:90%
We vibrate things out.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.620 align:middle line:90%
We vibrate people in.

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.560 align:middle line:90%
We vibrate people out.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.720 align:middle line:90%
We vibrate opportunities in.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So how do we become a
positive, vibrational

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:58.070 align:middle line:84%
being as opposed to
just a positive thinker?

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
It means cleaning out our
vibration of everything

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.800 align:middle line:84%
that is not serving us, raising
our vibration with love,

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
with all the things that
we know expand us and make

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
us feel that we're vibrating
at a higher frequency.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.940 align:middle line:10%
>>You can either match
fear, out in the world,

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.020 align:middle line:10%
and lower your
frequency, or you can

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.740 align:middle line:10%
stay in touch with your own
kind of preferred state, where

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:29.040 align:middle line:10%
you feel good and
happy, and stay in that.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.760 align:middle line:10%
It's like strike your
tuning fork and whoo.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And once you choose your
tone, let's call it,

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
your life starts to be
created out of that tone.

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:42.260 align:middle line:10%
If you choose a low one,
you get a low-level life,

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:44.240 align:middle line:10%
with a lot of
snags and problems.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
If you raise up and move
into the higher frequencies,

01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:51.924 align:middle line:84%
you get a new
understanding of reality

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:53.465 align:middle line:84%
where everything's
much more unified.

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%

>>Now that I was aware
that this infinity feedback

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:06.300 align:middle line:10%
loop was always
happening, I didn't

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.920 align:middle line:10%
understand how the
circumstances of my life,

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.410 align:middle line:10%
that I perceived
to be the greatest

challenges or the
biggest obstacles,

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.560 align:middle line:10%
were actually for my own good.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
If I was creating
my own reality,

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:28.280 align:middle line:84%
why did I keep creating
things I didn't want.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
If the feedback loop is
feeding me pain and adversity,

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:36.166 align:middle line:90%
then what am I feeding into it?

01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:52.770 align:middle line:90%

Your back is against
the proverbial wall.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
You're at your wit's end.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.710 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what to do.

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are in
situations that are chronic.

>>One of the greatest
challenges I experienced

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.470 align:middle line:90%
was the death of my mother.

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:33.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:34.979 align:middle line:90%
Is there really a gift in this?

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:39.229 align:middle line:84%
Is there really a blessing
in my mom passing?

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Can I find where she is now?

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Because really, we know
that she's in the heart.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.189 align:middle line:10%
I knew she was in my heart.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:49.930 align:middle line:10%
But to go to that place, to
actually find her there, as

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.229 align:middle line:10%
opposed to looking for
her on the outside, that

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.937 align:middle line:10%
was one of the greatest
challenges I ever

01:08:53.937 --> 01:08:56.310 align:middle line:10%
had in my life.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Because energy or matter
isn't created or destroyed.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.450 align:middle line:90%
All of us are energy.

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:01.830 align:middle line:90%
We know that we're existing now.

01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Right here, in this moment,
this experience is a gift.

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
exists right now.

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:09.177 align:middle line:90%
And my mother is here.

01:09:09.177 --> 01:09:10.260 align:middle line:90%
She's here in this moment.

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:11.334 align:middle line:90%
She's present.

01:09:11.334 --> 01:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is
present in every moment.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So the greatest
gift I got out of it

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.229 align:middle line:84%
was getting past the
illusion that there's

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
a death and a life
that are separate.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:25.590 align:middle line:90%

thing to go through.

He was my best friend.

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:39.279 align:middle line:90%
Life is good.

It's beautiful.

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:49.510 align:middle line:84%
One thing I could
learn about this,

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to live my
life and enjoy each moment.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where we are
going to leave this place.

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:02.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:04.320 align:middle line:90%
We have to love.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.190 align:middle line:90%
We have to forgive.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.700 align:middle line:90%
We have to be patient.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:14.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to be connected,
to try to be a good person.

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%


01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>My grandfather,
Tata-- well, Tata

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.050 align:middle line:90%
means grandfather in Polish.

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I always thought Tata
was his real name

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
until I was old enough to
know that Icek was actually

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:35.390 align:middle line:90%
his name.

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather had recently
undergone a triple bypass

at the age of 84.

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And things didn't go well.

01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And he was going to die soon.

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:45.780 align:middle line:90%
And I walked into the room.

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And I saw my grandfather there.

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me and he smiled.

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:54.340 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment, I
understood that this man,

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:59.300 align:middle line:10%
this extraordinary man was
never going to leave that room,

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.480 align:middle line:10%
was never going
to leave that bed.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.274 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, you know,
I know you're dying.

01:11:05.274 --> 01:11:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And what is the one thing
you want me to know,

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
that you want me to
tell my grandchildren.

01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And he said, wow.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, I'll
tell you a story.

01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Back in World War II,
I was a young soldier.

01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had your grandmother,
Dora, who you never met.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.910 align:middle line:10%
And she was pregnant
with your father.

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:41.470 align:middle line:10%
We were walking, on
foot, in the snow.

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:43.650 align:middle line:90%
And we got to a field hospital.

01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And in this field hospital,
in front of the advancing

01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Nazi army, your grandmother
gave birth to your father.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that, if we
stayed there, we would die.

01:11:56.850 --> 01:12:00.790 align:middle line:90%
So I stole a Jeep and food.

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And I drove as far
away as I could.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And when the Jeep ran out of
gas and when we ran out of food,

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.040 align:middle line:90%
we walked in the snow.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But there came a time when
we couldn't walk anymore,

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.490 align:middle line:84%
when we couldn't
take another step.

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never forget.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I was in a snowstorm.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I was carrying Dora on my
back and your infant father

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:26.680 align:middle line:90%
in my arms.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that maybe, if I
just rested for a little while,

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.090 align:middle line:90%
I could get up and go again.

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
The truth is I was passing
one person after another

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
that had stopped and died
in the place they stopped.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down at
your infant father, who

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
was dying of
pneumonia, by the way,

01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:50.280 align:middle line:90%
and I looked into his eyes.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, one day
your son will know no war.

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But today, you have
to do your part.

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to live
through the night.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And I will keep going.

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew, if I
stopped, I would die.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.435 align:middle line:90%
And he wouldn't live.

01:13:12.435 --> 01:13:13.810 align:middle line:10%
And you wouldn't exist.

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:16.730 align:middle line:10%


01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:20.880 align:middle line:10%
And the one thing
that I'm most proud of

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.480 align:middle line:10%
is that I kept my promise
that night to your father.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And here you are.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And who you are
to me is my heart.

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:33.930 align:middle line:90%


01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I left my grandfather
that night,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
and I never saw him again.

01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So many people,
all over the world,

01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
have made so many
sacrifices, literally

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
have given their life, so that
their family or this planet

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:54.260 align:middle line:84%
could have an
opportunity to discover

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
the gifts within themselves
and to experience

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:00.710 align:middle line:90%
the richness of life.

01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.840 align:middle line:90%


01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.168 align:middle line:90%
That's what matters.

01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:07.001 align:middle line:90%
That's what matters.

01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:18.550 align:middle line:90%


01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Just by being willing to look
for the gift in a situation,

01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:23.510 align:middle line:90%
my being changes.

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And it is our job is to identify
the goodness that is occurring.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.700 align:middle line:10%
It is serving our awakening
to the powerful co-creators

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.750 align:middle line:10%
that we are.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:37.070 align:middle line:10%
Every single thing
that is occurring

01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:38.174 align:middle line:10%
is serving that purpose.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing that's
happening in all of creation.

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:44.680 align:middle line:90%


01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>I recently discovered
I had prostate cancer.

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was an initial shock.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell that
triggered a series of the most

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
extraordinarily wonderful
events and experiences--

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
new friendships, a
closeness between myself

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and my wife of 20 years that
just keeps getting better.

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And we'd often thought it
couldn't get any better.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.760 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.920 align:middle line:90%
It just has been amazing.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.470 align:middle line:90%


01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But it took looking
for the blessing in it.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's the ultimate
accountability,

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.700 align:middle line:90%
ultimate responsibility.

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to look for
the goodness in things

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:30.992 align:middle line:84%
or am I going to look for
the darkness in things.

01:15:30.992 --> 01:15:31.825 align:middle line:90%
And that's a choice.

01:15:31.825 --> 01:15:43.680 align:middle line:90%


01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.660 align:middle line:10%
>>Just the idea of having
a great many different

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.010 align:middle line:10%
experiences in your
life, to be able to have

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:52.760 align:middle line:10%
those experiences-- positive,
negative, happy, sad,

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.954 align:middle line:10%
suffering, celebratory-- and to
be able to acknowledge that you

01:15:57.954 --> 01:15:59.370 align:middle line:10%
are experiencing
them, that you're

01:15:59.370 --> 01:16:02.400 align:middle line:10%
grateful for those experiences
and learning from them,

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.570 align:middle line:10%
to see every experience as
something that you can value

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:09.760 align:middle line:10%
and take with you that God
may be trying to teach you

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.110 align:middle line:10%
or also that God wants you to
experience as part of the gift

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:16.640 align:middle line:10%
that you are as a human being.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.020 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm going to let the
truck behind you back up.

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.980 align:middle line:10%
>>But that's a positive
experience, too,

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.970 align:middle line:10%
having that truck backing up
behind you, ruining your movie.

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:24.970 align:middle line:10%
You can learn from that.

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:26.636 align:middle line:10%
You can learn to have
a different angle.

01:16:26.636 --> 01:16:31.000 align:middle line:90%


01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>When something that could be
a crisis or a tragedy shows up,

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
instead of it's a problem,
what if it's for me?

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.420 align:middle line:10%
That's the way I find the gift.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.680 align:middle line:10%
I ask, what if this is for me?

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And immediately
that shifts my focus

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
from problem to solution and
positive possibility and even,

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.020 align:middle line:90%
oh boy.

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:57.686 align:middle line:84%
So simply by saying,
what if this is for me,

01:16:57.686 --> 01:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, I've
got a better feeling.

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:01.994 align:middle line:84%
I don't have this
crisis anymore.

01:17:01.994 --> 01:17:08.290 align:middle line:90%


01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>I was going to divorce
my husband, the father

01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:13.090 align:middle line:84%
of my child, the
man I love and have

01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:15.910 align:middle line:90%
chosen to spend my life with.

01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And we were really
having a hard time.

01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:20.630 align:middle line:90%


01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell most people
how much pain I was in.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But I had been dealing and
struggling with a back injury

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that I had had many years ago,
from a job related incident.

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:33.790 align:middle line:10%
And the more struggle we had in
our relationship, the more pain

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:36.360 align:middle line:10%
I started to be in physically.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
That energy manifested in a
very negative way in my body.

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it showed
up as a lot of pain,

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.715 align:middle line:90%
a lot of emotional pain.

01:17:44.715 --> 01:17:46.950 align:middle line:90%
It showed up as physical pain.

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:48.800 align:middle line:90%
My back ended up going out.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I got back surgery.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
There was all sorts of ways that
me not honoring my true voice

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and my husband not
honoring his true voice

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.745 align:middle line:90%
showed up in our lives.

01:17:57.745 --> 01:18:00.290 align:middle line:90%


01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:02.372 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
one of the biggest life

01:18:02.372 --> 01:18:03.955 align:middle line:84%
adversities I've
ever come up against.

01:18:03.955 --> 01:18:11.550 align:middle line:90%


01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>My sister, Shajen,
and her husband,

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Cherif, had been going
through a very difficult time.

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Their marriage
was falling apart.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
They were deeply in
love with each other,

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
but they were not
living a life that

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
honored the gifts that
they were for each other

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:31.910 align:middle line:90%
or for the world.

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>My husband was
struggling finding himself,

01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:36.720 align:middle line:90%
finding his path, his goal.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I saw his greatness, but
I didn't see him accessing it.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>I was lost.

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:43.295 align:middle line:90%
I had lost my passion.

01:18:43.295 --> 01:18:47.140 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't happy with the way
I was or what I was doing.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.570 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't happy with my marriage.

01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:50.360 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't happy with my life.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
how to get out of it.

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>They were stuck,
blaming each other,

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:59.370 align:middle line:84%
not in alignment with the
spiritual laws of the universe.

01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>I had forgotten
my childhood dream.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I'd let it go.

01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And it was eating away at me.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It all stemmed from having fear.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I was really afraid.

01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, I was
hiding behind this facade

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that, if I didn't go for my
dreams, then I wouldn't fail.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:26.210 align:middle line:90%
So I decided to let it die.

01:19:26.210 --> 01:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I was surprised to learn
that Cherif's dream had always

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.016 align:middle line:84%
been to come to Hollywood and
work in the movie business.

01:19:32.016 --> 01:19:36.570 align:middle line:84%
He even had a film
company set up in Morocco

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:39.840 align:middle line:84%
20 years before we
ever met each other.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So I did something
rather dramatic.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I explained to Cherif
that I had to hire

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:47.800 align:middle line:90%
a new VP for my company.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have to hire
that person today.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.530 align:middle line:90%
That was a Thursday.

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I offered him the job.

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But I said, if you
accept the job,

01:19:57.870 --> 01:20:00.150 align:middle line:84%
you have to pack
your bags, you have

01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to leave your wife and child,
move to California on Saturday,

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.580 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be in the
business meetings, with me,

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.490 align:middle line:90%
on Monday.

01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>I couldn't believe that I was
being offered the thing that I

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
was really dreaming
about for all of my life.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a big, steep
learning curve.

01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But I was passionate
about filmmaking,

01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
so the learning actually
came really easy.

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:31.204 align:middle line:84%
I was finally in
alignment with my gift.

01:20:31.204 --> 01:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the thing
I want to tell

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.911 align:middle line:84%
people is there is a thing
called transformation.

01:20:34.911 --> 01:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean it literally
means to transcend

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.960 align:middle line:84%
the limitations ordinarily
imposed by form.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a light switch.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
You can become really
good at anything

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that matters to you if
you're willing to do

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:52.590 align:middle line:90%
the work, anything.

01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:56.556 align:middle line:84%
>>My sister, Shajen, had
always wanted to write books,

01:20:56.556 --> 01:20:59.270 align:middle line:90%
to be an author.

01:20:59.270 --> 01:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
In truth, she'd been writing
as long as I could remember.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>It's always been my passion.

01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I've loved writing
since I was young.

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.960 align:middle line:10%
And I always
wondered, deep inside,

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.750 align:middle line:10%
how I'd get my real
feelings out to the world

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:13.370 align:middle line:10%
and how do I share them?

01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But I was so afraid to
put my voice on paper,

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:17.790 align:middle line:90%
to put my words down.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And I doubted myself.

01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I doubted who I was, if anyone
would care what I had to say.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And it always seemed really
big for me and too big

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
for me to even accomplish,
so why even try?

01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:31.600 align:middle line:90%


01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:37.210 align:middle line:10%
>>Forget the word "can't"
and just take a step.

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:40.100 align:middle line:10%
It might not even be
in the right direction.

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
But you won't know
that until you

01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
get to that step and then
the next step and then

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.690 align:middle line:90%
the next step.

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Take a step.

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:49.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all it is.

01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:52.540 align:middle line:90%


01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>And when I sat down to write
"Discover the Gift," at first

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh no, what
am I going to say?

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.370 align:middle line:90%
How do I do this?

01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, OK,
I know the key to writing

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:04.740 align:middle line:90%
is just writing.

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.160 align:middle line:90%
So just write, Shajen, write.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Once I took that
one step, that fear

01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:13.902 align:middle line:84%
that had been keeping me back
for so long was relinquished.

01:22:13.902 --> 01:22:15.985 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was
at this different place

01:22:15.985 --> 01:22:21.460 align:middle line:84%
with myself, really living my
gift, really being who I am.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:24.830 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that the
authentic me showed up.

01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so grateful.

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:32.955 align:middle line:90%


01:22:32.955 --> 01:22:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>And so she drove
across country

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.845 align:middle line:84%
and began to write "Discover
the Gift," the book,

01:22:38.845 --> 01:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and to co-produce the movie,
with me, alongside her husband.

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Both of them now fully
and actively engaged

01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:50.510 align:middle line:90%
in their gifts.

01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>When I started valuing my
own self, my heart, my time,

01:22:55.370 --> 01:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
my dream, it was like I came
out of a cave and finally,

01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:04.710 align:middle line:90%
finally started living in light.

01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Shajen and I just started having
another level of relationship.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.720 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Getting space and us getting
to be with ourselves, choosing

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:19.190 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and then having the
space to choose each other,

01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:20.620 align:middle line:90%
saved our marriage.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I look back now, I
giggle, because I think, wow,

01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that was so hard, but
yet it was so easy.

01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>The process isn't strategy
or fighting or forcing

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.680 align:middle line:90%
or controlling or trying harder.

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:38.595 align:middle line:10%
The process is relaxing
into it, going inside

01:23:38.595 --> 01:23:41.310 align:middle line:10%
and following that
inner direction.

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Because what I think
I want out there

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.010 align:middle line:90%
may not be for my highest good.

01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to get
really good at listening

01:23:48.170 --> 01:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to this inner direction, even
when it takes me someplace

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.820 align:middle line:90%
that isn't what I think I want.

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.364 align:middle line:90%
I need to surrender to that.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I need to recognize
what shows up there.

01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:58.196 align:middle line:90%
I need to cooperate with it.

01:23:58.196 --> 01:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And I need to let
go of the other

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and see if I can flow with this.

01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I do, it's
amazingly easy.

01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:07.188 align:middle line:90%
When I don't, it's hard.

01:24:07.188 --> 01:24:15.100 align:middle line:90%


01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:20.110 align:middle line:10%
>>When I was 19, I was
abducted and beaten

01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:22.170 align:middle line:10%
and repeatedly raped.

01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:26.080 align:middle line:10%
And the most unusual
thing happened

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.100 align:middle line:10%
in the midst of that experience.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I found this feeling
of safety emerging.

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.020 align:middle line:90%
The logic seems crazy.

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:40.426 align:middle line:84%
But my thought was, if I
could live through this,

01:24:40.426 --> 01:24:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I could live through anything.

01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if they
were going to let me live

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.930 align:middle line:90%
or if they would kill me.

01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized that, I
had this profound revelation,

01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:57.860 align:middle line:84%
not like some lofty concept
but as an actual experience.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I got that who I
am is not my body.

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Even if I didn't
make it out of there,

01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I would make it out of there.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, this
previously unthinkable act

01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:14.840 align:middle line:84%
turned into this gift
that I held in my heart.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Life recontextualizes itself.

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I named that as
a gift, my past was different.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And the future
truly became a space

01:25:26.290 --> 01:25:28.780 align:middle line:90%
where anything was possible.

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.875 align:middle line:84%
And forever since,
I've felt safe.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%


01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>We have a new
kind of evolution.

01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:56.750 align:middle line:10%
It's called conscious
and participatory,

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:59.210 align:middle line:10%
which means right here and
right now, at this second,

01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:05.840 align:middle line:10%
beginning with our own life,
we can change, we can shift,

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.170 align:middle line:10%
we can grow and become
who we're meant to be.

01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can determine our growth
and unfoldment and happiness

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.620 align:middle line:90%
except for ourselves.

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:19.270 align:middle line:90%


01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Commitment for
a better society

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
should rise within
each one of us.

01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Technology which has made
the globe into a village.

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And it is spirituality which is
going to make it into a family.

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.370 align:middle line:10%
>>It can't just be a few
political spokespeople

01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.869 align:middle line:10%
saying it.

01:26:37.869 --> 01:26:39.330 align:middle line:10%
It has to be
filmmakers saying it.

01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:40.700 align:middle line:10%
It has to be
scientists saying it.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It has to be corporate
execs saying it.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.411 align:middle line:90%
It has to be parents saying it.

01:26:43.411 --> 01:26:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It has to be whatever
you do, that you

01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
are so passionate about the
possibility of what could be,

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:53.602 align:middle line:84%
that you get that
life is a gift and you

01:26:53.602 --> 01:26:54.810 align:middle line:90%
get that it's not guaranteed.

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:58.875 align:middle line:90%


01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>It just takes one
person's awakening

01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to elevate the
consciousness of a family.

01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It just takes one
person's awakening

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
to elevate the consciousness
of a company or of a community.

01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:12.164 align:middle line:84%
And then it has
that ripple effect.

01:27:12.164 --> 01:27:33.140 align:middle line:90%


01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>You can't, in a
way, promote states

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.940 align:middle line:84%
of being that you,
yourself, don't understand.

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:44.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't promote world
peace if you are angry.

01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:46.516 align:middle line:84%
As Gandhi said, you
have to be the change.

01:27:46.516 --> 01:27:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It begins with your
own transformation.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:54.390 align:middle line:90%


01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>I was beginning
to find my balance

01:27:56.710 --> 01:27:58.760 align:middle line:84%
with the spiritual
laws of the universe.

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.500 align:middle line:90%


01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:05.670 align:middle line:84%
They were like different
colors of the rainbow,

01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:10.280 align:middle line:84%
each beautiful by itself,
but joined together,

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
they shine as a
single white light

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.180 align:middle line:84%
illuminating everything
and everyone.

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:22.350 align:middle line:90%


01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:26.585 align:middle line:84%
I feel the laws flowing
through me like a river, now,

01:28:26.585 --> 01:28:32.750 align:middle line:84%
with a strong but steady
current washing the resistance

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:34.500 align:middle line:90%
to my own existence away.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:38.820 align:middle line:90%


01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>It's like the rolling
stones in the water.

01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Water flows.

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't stop because
there is a stone.

01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:47.790 align:middle line:90%
It flows over it.

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:52.628 align:middle line:84%
And in due course, it even
shapes the stone, itself.

01:28:52.628 --> 01:28:56.940 align:middle line:84%
It just needs a little
perseverance, patience,

01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:03.955 align:middle line:84%
and conviction that love
wins and will always win.

01:29:03.955 --> 01:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>I had the unique experience
to die at one time.

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I was in a car accident
and pronounced dead.

01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:17.545 align:middle line:84%
I had the experience
of being everything,

01:29:17.545 --> 01:29:23.470 align:middle line:84%
of experiencing all the
important people in my life,

01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:27.410 align:middle line:84%
whether they were
alive or had passed on.

01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had time to talk
with them and be with them.

01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like it was
days that I was experiencing.

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I also experienced
being the ocean.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I was a drop of the ocean.

01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But then a drop of the
ocean is the ocean.

01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And then there was light.

01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:49.996 align:middle line:90%
And I was part of the light.

01:29:49.996 --> 01:29:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that
I had talked to

01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and been with during that
time was part of the light.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

01:29:57.130 --> 01:29:58.630 align:middle line:90%
And it was full of joy.

01:29:58.630 --> 01:30:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And there was no judgement.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
All there was was love,
beautiful, magnificent, all

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.930 align:middle line:90%
encompassing love.

01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:32.000 align:middle line:90%


01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Agape means
unconditional love.

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a love that cannot
be done with the mind.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a love that takes us
over when our heart is open.

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And we discover there's
no boundary between us,

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's all about love, and
it's all about forgiveness,

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and that the
universe doesn't have

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.970 align:middle line:90%
one ounce of retribution in it.

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:53.790 align:middle line:90%
All it has is love.

01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:56.652 align:middle line:84%
It's just a unified
field of love.

01:30:56.652 --> 01:30:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Think about it.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.030 align:middle line:10%
When you're around
someone who's loving,

01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:middle line:10%
do they have to say
anything to you?

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.760 align:middle line:10%
You just feel their energy.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.300 align:middle line:10%
Their goodness just overflows.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:08.080 align:middle line:10%
There's really only
one law, and it's

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.570 align:middle line:10%
the law of love that
makes me one with you,

01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:16.070 align:middle line:10%
with them, with the people on
the other side of the globe,

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:18.660 align:middle line:10%
with everyone everywhere.

01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:22.425 align:middle line:84%
And when you find love,
you've found everything.

01:31:22.425 --> 01:31:25.690 align:middle line:90%


01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:28.940 align:middle line:10%
>>It's this continual
state of being,

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.680 align:middle line:10%
so it's about doing
that in our work

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.680 align:middle line:10%
and then bringing
that into your moment

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.580 align:middle line:10%
to moment interactions
and connections

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:39.190 align:middle line:10%
and into your moment
to moment life.

01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:42.587 align:middle line:84%
It's about being the light
and bringing that light,

01:31:42.587 --> 01:31:43.920 align:middle line:90%
reflecting it everywhere you go.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:48.530 align:middle line:90%


01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:52.582 align:middle line:84%
>>There's nothing loving
won't heal, nothing, nothing.

01:31:52.582 --> 01:31:55.480 align:middle line:90%
And I forget that sometimes.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But I never forget
that I've gotten it.

01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:59.615 align:middle line:90%
And I know I can return there.

01:31:59.615 --> 01:32:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when I
do, my life is beautiful

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and the results I
produce are positive.

01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of spills over.

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And someone else picks
it up and passes it on.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:12.430 align:middle line:90%
It just multiplies that way.

01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>As long as I'm
in a state of love,

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.960 align:middle line:90%
miracles will happen here.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you know that only love
is real, it changes everything.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Love is the basic principle
of how everything works.

01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:25.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't cause pain.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't do violence
to anything, in any way,

01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:30.340 align:middle line:90%
even in the subtlest way.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it hurts
the whole system,

01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:35.530 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
comes back to you.

01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:38.569 align:middle line:90%


01:32:38.569 --> 01:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Coming from our
heart is authentic.

01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's a feeling experience.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.020 align:middle line:10%
And what I recommend
to people is,

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.200 align:middle line:10%
hey, you've got to
be able to feel it.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.040 align:middle line:10%
If you can feel
it, if you can feel

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.290 align:middle line:10%
that someone's coming
from their heart,

01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:52.510 align:middle line:10%
then you know you're hearing
them with your heart.

01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:55.510 align:middle line:90%


01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Your heart will
always be true.

01:32:58.410 --> 01:33:01.930 align:middle line:10%
Whenever you have a question,
put your hands on your heart,

01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:03.835 align:middle line:10%
ask that question.

01:33:03.835 --> 01:33:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Your heart will tell you
instantly what the answer is.

01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And our tendency is to follow
the fear that lives up here.

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:15.000 align:middle line:84%
When we just find that peace
in ourselves, walk our truth,

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.770 align:middle line:84%
always be in your
heart, your life

01:33:16.770 --> 01:33:20.970 align:middle line:90%
will become easier, much easier.

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a language
beyond words.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a language of our hearts.

01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:27.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a language of the soul.

01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we give our love,
we add to that vibration

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.360 align:middle line:90%
that encircles the universe.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:34.784 align:middle line:84%
When we let go of our
words and our thoughts,

01:33:34.784 --> 01:33:35.950 align:middle line:90%
then we fall into our heart.

01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:38.510 align:middle line:90%


01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:41.800 align:middle line:10%
>>We should call "normal" the
person who awakens each morning

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:46.500 align:middle line:10%
with shining eyes, seeing each
day as a gift, clearly centered

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.460 align:middle line:10%
in what they're passionate
about and committed

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:51.590 align:middle line:10%
to a practice of getting better
and better and better at it

01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:53.800 align:middle line:10%
and living a life that's
a gift to the world,

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.750 align:middle line:10%
welcoming people
of all ethnicity

01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:59.135 align:middle line:10%
and persuasion with
respect and warmth.

01:33:59.135 --> 01:34:01.925 align:middle line:10%
We ought to call that normal.

01:34:01.925 --> 01:34:02.950 align:middle line:10%
>>It's simple.

01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:05.074 align:middle line:10%
It's you.

01:34:05.074 --> 01:34:05.740 align:middle line:90%
You're the gift.

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:10.240 align:middle line:90%


01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.350 align:middle line:10%
>>Since all there is
is this present moment,

01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:16.110 align:middle line:10%
since it's the only thing that
exists, how much of a gift

01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:19.596 align:middle line:10%
is it to actually be present
with the person in front of you

01:34:19.596 --> 01:34:21.720 align:middle line:10%
and expressing love to that
person in front of you?

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.982 align:middle line:90%
Think about that for moment.

01:34:22.982 --> 01:34:27.410 align:middle line:90%


01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>If you had asked, what are
you going to be doing in a year,

01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I never would have
thought that I'd

01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:33.510 align:middle line:84%
be here speaking with
you, that I have gone

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:36.590 align:middle line:84%
through this incredible journey,
working and creating "Discover

01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:39.140 align:middle line:84%
the Gift," and that I would
have, through that work,

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.940 align:middle line:84%
transformed myself and
discovered my own gifts.

01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we ended
up creating was

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.960 align:middle line:84%
a family of
togetherness and love.

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:47.755 align:middle line:90%
We have unity.

01:34:47.755 --> 01:34:58.360 align:middle line:90%


01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.938 align:middle line:10%
>>The discovery of the gift
of forgiveness, compassion,

01:35:02.938 --> 01:35:08.930 align:middle line:10%
and family has resulted in
the healing of my heart.

01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Love is the gift
that reveals itself.

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:23.604 align:middle line:90%


01:35:23.604 --> 01:35:27.912 align:middle line:84%
I am now being the man
I always wanted to be,

01:35:27.912 --> 01:35:36.540 align:middle line:84%
with my family, my friends,
my business, my community.

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:41.930 align:middle line:90%


01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:44.784 align:middle line:84%
Love is the true
hidden treasure.

01:35:44.784 --> 01:36:03.670 align:middle line:90%


01:36:03.670 --> 01:36:06.155 align:middle line:84%
Living your life
is like sailing.

01:36:06.155 --> 01:36:10.180 align:middle line:90%


01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly making
adjustments and corrections.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:20.419 align:middle line:84%
But once you take the
wheel and set your course,

01:36:20.419 --> 01:36:22.784 align:middle line:90%
you can go anywhere.

01:36:22.784 --> 01:36:26.580 align:middle line:90%


01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And after this long
journey of my own,

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:36.410 align:middle line:84%
if there's any wisdom I can
offer, it is simply this.

01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Follow your heart.

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Discover your gift.

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:45.722 align:middle line:84%
And get ready for the greatest
adventure of your life.
