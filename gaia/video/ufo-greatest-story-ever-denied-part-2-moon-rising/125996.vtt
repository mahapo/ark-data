>>CBS Radio presents the news.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
From Washington, here
is Bob Pierpoint.

>>Another larger
Sputnik with a dog

1,000 miles out in space.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:10%
The Russians launched an
1,100-pound satellite late last

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:10%
night and, so far, both Sputnik
2 and it's canine passenger are

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:10%
reported doing well.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:10%
>>The dramatic
achievements in space

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:10%
which occurred in recent weeks
should've made clear to us

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:10%
all, as did the Sputnik in 1957,
the impact of this invention

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:10%
on the minds of
men everywhere who

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:10%
are attempting to make a
determination of which road

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:10%
they should take.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Radio Moscow started
broadcasting time schedules

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.320 align:middle line:84%
for its latest satellite a short
while ago with the announcement

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that Sputnik 2 will pass
over in Washington, DC,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
in just a few minutes from now.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jay Allen Hynek,
well-known associate director

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Smithsonian Observatory
at Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:84%
was asked if the half-ton
weight of Sputnik 2

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
indicated the Russians
might have a war

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
rocket powerful enough to reach
this continent from the Soviet

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Union.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
"It certainly indicates
they have the capabilities

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
of launching an intercontinental
ballistic missile,"

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:90%
replied Dr. Hynek.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Now it is time to
take longer strides.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Time for a great, new
American enterprise.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Time for this nation to
take a clearly leading role

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in space achievement,
which in many ways

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
may hold the key to
our future on Earth.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. John S. Rinehart,
also with the Smithsonian

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Observatory, commented
after studying figures

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
on the new Soviet
satellite, "I firmly believe

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
the Russians could reach
the moon in a few days."

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.952 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe we should
go to the moon.

00:03:08.952 --> 00:03:11.106 align:middle line:84%
But I think every
citizen of this country,

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
as well as the members
of the Congress,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
should consider the
matter carefully.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Every scientist, every
engineer, every service man,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
every technician,
contractor, and civil servant

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
gives his personal pledge that
this nation will move forward

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
with the full speed of freedom
in the exciting adventure

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:90%
of space.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:84%
We go into space
because whatever

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
mankind must undertake,
free men must fully shape.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>On January 25th, 1994, the
Deep Space Program Science

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Experiment known as
Clementine was launched

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:90%
from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Clementine was able to
deliver more than 1.8

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
million digital images between
February 26 and April 22, 1994.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
These images were
quickly accessible

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
to the general public
on the world wide web.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, President Clinton
cited the Clementine Mission

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
as one of the major
national achievements

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:90%
in aeronautics in space.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a segment from the
2009 version of Moon Rising.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it featured the
Clementine Lunar Image Browser

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.809 align:middle line:84%
1.5 with instructions on
how to find a Moon Anomaly.

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
This is what it
looked like before it

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:90%
was taken off the internet.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Click on the desired
resolution section

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and choose the one pixel
equals 1 kilometer option.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
On the image size in pixels
option, choose 768 by 768.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
You are now ready to see
for yourself the huge object

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the moon.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
On the moon map, you
will easily see a dot

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
on the top of this crater
and on the lower left.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Click on the black dot
on top of the crater

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and the close-up image of this
section appears in the browser.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
What you see is a
huge object resting

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
at the top of what is
known as the Zeeman Crater.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:10%
It appears to be a large machine
or perhaps a large spaceship.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But one thing's for
certain-- the contours

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
of this huge object
present qualities

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
which lead to suggest
an intelligent presence.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You can clearly see that this
image has been smudged over

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and blurred around most of
the object so we cannot see

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.227 align:middle line:90%
the details.

00:06:20.227 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:10%
This little gem was
brought to the attention

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:10%
of moon researchers
around the world

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:10%
by Joseph P. Skipper
on May 28, 2004.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:10%
I decided to hire
an image forensics

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:10%
expert to take
this official image

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:10%
and see what other
pertinent information can

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:10%
be gathered from it.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.424 align:middle line:10%
Jim Hoerricks, an
image forensics expert

00:06:39.424 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:10%
who's worked with the Los
Angeles Police Department,

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:10%
was sent various
Clementine images.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:10%
And his findings were
written in a report

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:10%
that he submitted
to the production.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
astounding measurements

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Jim made from the
Zeeman Crater object

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
reveal that this anomaly is 10
times the size of Los Angeles.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:90%
10 times the size.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
This, in itself, is
an incredible detail

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:90%
about the size of this object.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
By using Adobe Photoshop
and some of the filters

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:84%
available within
the program, we were

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
able to bring out more
of the details that

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
were lost due to
the image tampering

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
at the hands of the
Department of Defense,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
or whomever directs the
Clementine Mission archives.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
This enormous object appears
intelligent in its design

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and presents many features we
associate with our technology

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:84%
In all of the enhancements
of the Zeeman object made

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
independently, I am left
asking, is this Clementine image

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
at Zeeman Crater the first
extraterrestrial evidence

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
successfully captured on film
under a public funded program?

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the contours of
this area, in particular,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
have compelled me to ask
this question, above all.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
We will never know the
truth behind this image

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
until the Department
of Defense--

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:84%
or those responsible for
tampering with this photo--

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
release the image to
the general public.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The smudging used for the
sensory of this object,

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
which was photographed in 1994,
was not done with precision

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
because you can see small parts
of this incredible, anomalous

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:90%
object.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for
moon researchers,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the Zeeman Crater is located
on the far side of the moon.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's still
there or not, we

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
will never know until this
information is released to us.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
After I released
the first version

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:84%
of "Moon Rising" in 2009,
the Clementine web browser

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
1.5-- where you
could have visited

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and found these anomalies
yourself-- was taken out.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
They replaced it with the new
2.0 version of the Clementine

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:90%
lunar image browser.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
"Moon Rising" must have
raised some eyebrows

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
because those who
had seen my film

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
were beginning to visit
the image browser 1.5

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.831 align:middle line:84%
and seeing these
anomalies for themselves.

00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
When you go to this
new browser, you

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:84%
will now see the Zeeman
Crater in all of its clarity.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
There is no object there anymore
and there is no smudging,

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:84%
blurring, or tampering of any
kind near or within the crater.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask ourselves, if
there is nothing on the moon

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to suggest alien moon bases,
strange structures, machines,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and possibly advanced
civilizations thriving there,

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
then why is there
evidence of the deliberate

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
tampering of these
and the many images

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
we will present
here in this film?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
While making "Moon
Rising" in 2009,

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a scene where we would
zoom from Earth to the moon.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So I needed a 3D
model of the moon.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And I contacted some friends who
work in special visual effects

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:84%
here in the studios
and asked them

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
where I can go to get an
accurate 3-D model that's

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:90%
detailed and looks real.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Everyone I talked to
sent me a mapaplanet.com,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:10%
which is on the USGS website.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:10%
That's the United States
Geological Survey website.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Up until I went there, I was
still under the impression

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that moon is gray,
black, and white

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:84%
because that's the way NASA
and others have portrayed it

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.450 align:middle line:84%
When I hit mapaplanet.com,
the Earth, moon, Mars, and all

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:90%
the other planets were listed.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I clicked on the moon
thumbnail and it sends me

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to a page that has
different photography

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:90%
samples of the moon.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:10%
But what caught my eye was the
one that says natural color.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:10%
So I clicked on this and
a whole new impression

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:10%
was put to me about the moon.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I found the skin,
in full color, of the moon

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:10%
that, when wrapped around the
3D sphere in my modeling program

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:10%
called Cinema 4D,
the moon came to life

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:10%
in its full, natural color.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:10%
I was totally overwhelmed.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.747 align:middle line:84%
I started zooming into
the moon's many areas

00:10:28.747 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and found some of
the most incredible,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
full-color photography of
the moon that none of us

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:90%
have ever seen before.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
I was compelled to
download all the photos

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I could-- and in
high resolution--

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
to use in my films.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
This footage shows you some
of the most spectacular

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.824 align:middle line:84%
full-color photography I've
downloaded from mapaplanet.com,

00:10:46.824 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:90%
the website.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:10%
And we are lucky I downloaded
close to 845 images

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:10%
in 2009, because after I
released "Moon Rising," when

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:10%
you now go to mapaplanet.com,
the full-color photos of some

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:10%
of the most revealing
and important areas

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:10%
have been tampered
with and the colors are

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:10%
distorted or overexposed.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:10%
I urge you to go to
mapaplanet.com and click

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:10%
on the natural color
link of the moon.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:10%
Start exploring it in
full color for yourself.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
There is more to our
moon than meets the eye.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
In full color, you
have depth of field

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and can see the anomalies
right before your very eyes.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I used to have to explain
why the moon appears

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
gray from Earth
many, many times.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, an amateur astronomer
from Richmond, Texas

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.570 align:middle line:84%
decided to take the
initiative and find out

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:84%
if, in fact, the moon
is full of color.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:10%
>>I got real interested
in color whenever

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:10%
I saw Jose's film
called "Moon Rising."

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that
inspired me big time.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:10%
>>After Bill Bryson viewed
my film "Moon Rising,"

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:10%
he was determined to
find out whether or not

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:10%
there was something to what I
had presented in that movie.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
His results have
become what will

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:90%
be the future of astronomy.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
No longer will amateur
and, in some cases,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
professional astronomers
have to become

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
part of the perpetual myth
about the moon's true essence.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:10%
Even in these early
photographs taken

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:10%
during the Russian
ZOND missions--

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:10%
before the Apollo
missions took place--

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:10%
they reveal that the moon is
a full-color celestial body.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:84%
While going through hundreds
of photographs of the moon that

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
have anomalies in them,
this one particular photo

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:90%
really stood out.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
This is AS17-150-23085--
a high-resolution color

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
photograph taken by the Apollo
17 Hasselblad cameras in 1972.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Looking at this photo, at first
glance, doesn't reveal much.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.061 align:middle line:84%
This is because it was
published upside down

00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and the exposure has been
tampered with in order

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
to make details hard to see.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
By turning the
photo right side up,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:90%
we can now start working on it.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:10%
First of all, we reset the
contrast levels in order

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:10%
to get rid of that brightness.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:10%
It was taken in
color, so we make

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:10%
adjustments to bring back
most of the color that

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:10%
had been washed out.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Zooming into the
landscape, we see

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
what appears to be a giant
structure, or a machine,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
leaning against the
rim of the crater.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
There is a tentacle-like tubing,
or wiring, connected to it.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And there is also an opening
where part of it is cut away.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Surveying the crater
along the edge,

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
there is another object that is
round and appears to also have

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:90%
tubing connected to it.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Further inside the crater,
toward the bottom area,

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
there appears to be a large,
self-illuminating glow.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
After researching
this particular photo,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I needed to find its location.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I downloaded the Apollo Mission
17 Lunar Photography Index Map,

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and by overlaying a section of
the full-color Clementine moon

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:84%
map, and stretching it
to match the index map,

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.309 align:middle line:84%
I was able to pinpoint the
exact position of the crater.

00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:23.725 align:middle line:84%
I found out the
name of the crater

00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
is Lobachevsky, named
after Nikolai Lobachevsky,

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:84%
a Russian mathematician
who was known

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:90%
as the Copernicus of geometry.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So I then went back
to Map-a-Planet

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and zoomed in on this area
and downloaded the crater,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:90%
where this object is resting.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, there it is.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it from
this aerial view,

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:84%
we have a different
perspective of the structure.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:10%
The Lobachevsky crater is
84 kilometers in diameter,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.339 align:middle line:10%
or 52 miles.

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:10%
This makes the size of this
structure at least 10 miles

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:10%
wide and about six miles
high from the bottom floor

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:10%
of the crater.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:84%
We can see the bright
glow that we detected

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
towards the bottom of the crater
is still burning, or glowing,

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:84%
even after 22 years since the
Apollo 17 photo was taken,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:90%
in December 1972.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:84%
From this vantage point, we
can see another bright glow

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
with what appears to be a
bluish-white smoke coming out

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:90%
of the top of the fire.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:84%
We can also see that the
round object seen here

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
at the 9 o'clock
position of the crater

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
still appears to be a round
structure of some kind leaning

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.402 align:middle line:90%
on the ridge of the crater.

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
The reason I feel that glow
to the left of the object

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.502 align:middle line:84%
might be cutting away
the rim of the crater

00:15:27.502 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
is because to the
right of the structure,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
there's a perfectly
cut section that

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
was not evident in the Apollo
17 photo 22 years earlier.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:10%
I found another
version of Lobachevsky

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:10%
photographed by Apollo
16 in April 1972.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:10%
This photo is AS16-121-19407.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.525 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we found
out, which is interesting.

00:15:50.525 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
This section,
where the object is

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
resting on the Apollo 17 photo,
looks like it's been excavated.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:84%
You can even see a
tower, or a column,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
shaped like a cross
at the top, right

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the excavation.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:84%
There is also a tunnel
opening-- what appears

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.817 align:middle line:90%
to be a gray or metallic mound.

00:16:06.817 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:84%
A close-up of the crater taken
by the Clementine mission

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
in 1994 appears like
it has been expanded.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You can still see the tower,
or column, in the entryway

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:90%
of whatever this structure is.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look closely
at it, you can

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
see more tentacle-like
tubing, or wiring,

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of the crater.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
This is an amazing aerial
view of the structure

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:90%
that is still there.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:10%
At least we know someone
started excavating

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:10%
for the building of this
structure in April of 1972.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:10%
And we saw more of the strange
object in its building stages

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:10%
within eight months
of the excavation.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:10%
Here it is in 1994.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:10%
And the object is still
there serving some purpose

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:10%
for someone in this crater.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We are fortunate to have this
proof that there is something

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And we are witness
to something that

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:84%
has been constructed
on the lunar surface

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:90%
at the edge of this crater.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
We know that someone, or should
I say something, built this.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:10%
>>I got started
in this, probably,

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:10%
in the mid-1990s
listening to Hoagland

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:10%
on the old coast-to-coast AM
radio program with Art Bell.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:10%
And he was talking
about the stuff

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:10%
that he'd found on the moon.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.097 align:middle line:10%
Some images and some
things that clearly

00:17:15.097 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:10%
appeared to be structures.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:10%
They were very anomalous.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.474 align:middle line:10%
And he was noting that there
were thousands upon thousands

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:10%
of photographs that had
been taken of the moon

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:10%
by the various unmanned probes.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the astronauts
that had orbited the moon.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
Art, anybody can do this.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
is A, I'm anybody.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
B, I think I understand
the arguments.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm an engineer by trade--
aerospace engineer.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I may not be an
architect, but I certainly

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:90%
know structure when I see it.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at the
evidence that he presented.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:90%
And I just got fascinated by it.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I created a web page called
the Lunar Anomalies Home

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Page, which still exists.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.276 align:middle line:10%
And it was all dedicated
to stuff on the moon.

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>The Hubble telescope has taken
the most incredible photography

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
of deep space and far
off in the vast universe.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:84%
When you see these
spectacular scenes,

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
you can't help but wonder how
many others live out there.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So when NASA was asked by
scientists and astronomers

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
when the Hubble telescope
would be used in photographing

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
the moon, NASA's reply was
that because the moon was

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:84%
too bright, it would be
impossible to get accurate

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:90%
photography of the moon.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
The first photo was released
from the Hubble Space

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Telescope in 1999.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Needless to say, the
scientists and astronomers

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.632 align:middle line:10%
were not too pleased at how NASA
had deliberately lied to them.

00:18:34.632 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:10%
When I heard about
this photograph,

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.332 align:middle line:10%
I thought for sure we would
see the moon in full color.

00:18:39.332 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But of all the photos
taken by the Hubble

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.912 align:middle line:84%
telescope of the moon, they
are in black and white.

00:18:43.912 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Prepare yourself for
an incredible expedition

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:84%
as we now take you back to
the moon on a voyage filled

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.335 align:middle line:90%
with mystery and secrecy.

00:18:56.335 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm not sure why NASA has
not told us what's on the moon.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
In a way, they have told us
because the pictures are there.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:90%
And there's hundreds of them.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So anybody can do what I did
and go and look at the pictures

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and enlarge them and
see what there is.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NASA has been there.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:10%
But we haven't been
back since 1972.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:10%
And you sit there and
wonder why that is.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's our closest celestial
neighbor in the heavens.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
You can see it every night
when you walk outside.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And really, there's so
much mystery about it

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:90%
still to this day.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Many people seem to think that
the Apollo program answered

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these questions.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.657 align:middle line:90%
And in many ways, it did.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But we, the general
public, have never

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.698 align:middle line:84%
been privy to any
of those answers.

00:20:02.698 --> 00:20:19.457 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.457 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Is there are already
somebody there?

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And is there even a
secret space program

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about that?

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even NASA's
doesn't know about,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that's been to the
moon and back and using

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
very advanced technology?

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>A cover story that's based
entirely upon the premise

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that there was
absolutely no life there.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And that there is no life to
be found past, present, at all.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's simply not the case.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>I certainly believe that
some of the stuff that we're

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.825 align:middle line:84%
finding on the moon may be
alien-- extraterrestrial--

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in origin, it may be
ruined, ancient, abandoned

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial ruins.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Some of it may be active.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.156 align:middle line:84%
And some of it, in fact,
may be our own stuff.

00:21:00.156 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't think
there's any possibility

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
that NASA is not aware of the
civilizations on the moon.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And the structures.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:84%
They're very
obvious, easy to see.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>They are in contact with some
of these extraterrestrial life

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
you to know about it.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>There is the guy that
hacked into the NASA database

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and found some listings of
non-terrestrial officers.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NASA may have made
a deal with the beings

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
up there to not reveal
their civilization.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:84%
But then again, the
pictures have the evidence.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.382 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the pictures anyway.

00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>The whole purpose
to the cover up

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is to prevent we, the plebeian
masses of this planet,

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.726 align:middle line:84%
from gaining the appreciation
that there is, indeed,

00:21:46.726 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
life out there--

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.931 align:middle line:84%
intelligent
extraterrestrial life.

00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is life
that the government

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
is very well aware of-- the
governments around the world.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.040 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly not a US issue.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:90%
They're very well aware of it.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Because you've
been lied to, you've

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
been robbed of something
that you deserve,

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:84%
which is to know what
your true history is

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and what your true
significance is in this world.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>I really don't think people
realize how deep the lie goes.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:90%
How big it is.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:84%
How unbelievable
the cover up is.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.886 align:middle line:84%
This truly is the greatest
story ever denied.

00:22:26.886 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It is the most amazing
secret never told.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
It is the most monumental
cover up in human history.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, the public
will take a movie like this

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and will begin to open
up some doors-- begin

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to open up some
windows-- to the truth.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's from
the government,

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it's from other
insiders who can now

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
come forward and begin to tell
their stories of what they did

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and their involvement
in this cover up

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:90%
to get the truth out there.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the world's
ready for it.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, a
movie like this will

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:84%
push that forward a little
bit and speed the process up.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>The very word secrecy is
repugnant in a free and open

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And we are, as a
people, inherently

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and historically, opposed
to secret societies,

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to secret oaths, and
to secret proceedings.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
We decided long ago
that the dangers

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
of excessive and unwarranted
concealment of pertinent facts

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:84%
far outweighed the dangers
which are cited to justify it.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And there is very grave
danger that an announced need

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:84%
for increased security will
be seized upon by those

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:84%
anxious to expand its
meaning to the very limits

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.846 align:middle line:84%
of official censorship
and concealment.

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:84%
That I do not intend
to permit to the extent

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:90%
that it's in my control.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And no official of
my administration,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
whether his rank is high or
low, civilian or military,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
should interpret my
words here tonight

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:84%
as an excuse to censor the
news, to stifle dissent,

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:84%
to cover up our
mistakes, or to withhold

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
from the press and the public
the facts they deserve to know.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.774 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.774 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>By playing around with these
images using moder software

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:84%
techniques, some of the
results really are eye-opening.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, it really
comes back to you've

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:84%
got to ask yourself
the question, why

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:84%
do NASA-- or any of the
other space agencies,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
or any of the major
observatories--

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
why will they not show you
any of the new adaptive optics

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.395 align:middle line:90%
imagery of the moon?

00:24:53.395 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:84%
They simply won't
show it to you.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any, they claim.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.135 align:middle line:84%
>>A report was prepared
under contract to NASA

00:25:01.135 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:84%
by the Brookings
Institute, Washington DC.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
The report outlines
the need to investigate

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:84%
the possible social consequences
of an extraterrestrial

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
discovery and to consider
whether such a discovery should

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
be kept from the public, in
order to avoid political change

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.928 align:middle line:84%
and a possible devastating
effect on scientists themselves

00:25:21.928 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
due to the discovery that many
of their own most cherished

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:90%
theories could be at risk.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>And it says in there that
you should seriously consider

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:84%
covering that information up
because it may, in fact, lead

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to what it calls the
disintegration of our culture.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Because of the tremendous
cultural impact--

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.090 align:middle line:84%
the shock-- that it
would have, especially

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to scientists and engineers who
think-- who've come to believe,

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
arrogantly, I think-- that
we are the top of the heap.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:84%
That we are part of
some natural process

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and we are the dominant species.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
that argument flies.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that document
is nothing more

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:84%
than their political
and legal cover for what

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:90%
they've been doing.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a much bigger
issue that comes out here.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't is that
NASA is not a civilian science

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:90%
agency.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.010 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the actual
charter under which NASA

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
was originally put
into existence,

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
it states clearly
there that NASA

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
is an adjunct-- a division
of the Department of Defense.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.412 align:middle line:84%
And it is beholden to the
Department of Defense.

00:26:30.412 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>When you couple the
Brookings Institute

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
report with a document called
Executive Order 10501, 10501

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:84%
was a document that
was specifically

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:84%
related to safeguarding official
information in the interest

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:44.915 align:middle line:90%
of national defense.

00:26:44.915 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to note
that the term national defense

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
actually includes not
only considerations

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of a military perspective,
but also geoeconomic

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.440 align:middle line:90%
and geopolitical, as well.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
When you compare, or take
those two documents-- when

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.762 align:middle line:84%
you take 10501 and the
Brookings Institute report,

00:27:02.762 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:84%
right there, that lays the
framework for the greatest

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:90%
story ever denied.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
That gives them legal
justification to cover this up.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:28:06.185 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Final control, Houston.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.448 align:middle line:84%
Switching now to the
voice of Jim Lovell.

00:28:10.448 --> 00:28:11.915 align:middle line:90%
>>By 60.5.

00:28:11.915 --> 00:28:14.049 align:middle line:90%
Good to hear your voice.

00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:14.849 align:middle line:90%
>>Apollo 8.

00:28:14.849 --> 00:28:18.272 align:middle line:84%
Houston, what does the old
moon look like from 60 miles?

00:28:18.272 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Over.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.695 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, Houston.

00:28:21.695 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:90%
The moon is, essentially, gray.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.607 align:middle line:90%
No color.

00:28:25.607 --> 00:28:27.563 align:middle line:90%
Looks like plaster of Paris.

00:28:27.563 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>It has been speculated the
moon missions were hoaxed.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps some of
the Apollo missions

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
were filmed in
different locations

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and in studios in
order to conceal

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.276 align:middle line:84%
the incredible discoveries
found on the moon.

00:28:43.276 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
In 1979, Maurice
Chatelain, former chief

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:84%
of NASA Communications
Systems, confirmed

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Neil Armstrong had indeed
reported seeing two

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:90%
UFOs on the rim of a crater.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
The encounter was common
knowledge at NASA, he revealed,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.770 align:middle line:84%
but nobody has talked
about it until now.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:21.415 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.415 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Even if you don't
care what's up there,

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:84%
you damn sure care
about the lies

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.017 align:middle line:84%
that are being put in place
to hide what's up there.

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Whether you have the
interest in the space program

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:84%
or the interest in what's going
on over our planet's atmosphere

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
or not, you are
affected by the lies

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that are in place to maintain
this greatest of all cover ups.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.407 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about a massive effort

00:29:48.407 --> 00:29:49.865 align:middle line:84%
by the military
industrial complex.

00:29:49.865 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Couple of nuclear
weapons sent into space

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.470 align:middle line:84%
were destroyed by the
extraterrestrials.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.770 align:middle line:10%
Our government sent a
nuclear weapon for explosion

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:10%
on the moon's surface.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:10%
It was intended to,
as I understand it,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:10%
to assess some scientific data
and reaction and so forth.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:10%
>>When I was a corporate manager
of Fairchild Industries in 1974

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:10%
through '77, I met the late Dr.
Werner Von Braun and early '74.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.670 align:middle line:10%
At that time, Von Braun
was dying of cancer,

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:10%
but he assured me that he would
live a few more years in order

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:10%
to tell me about the game
that was being played.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.950 align:middle line:84%
That game being the
effort to weaponize space.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>The idea of any explosion in
space by any earth government

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:84%
was not acceptable to
the extraterrestrials.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And that has been
demonstrated over and over.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>The strategy that Werner
Von Braun taught me was that,

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.750 align:middle line:84%
first, the Russians are going to
be considered to be the enemy.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.292 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I met him in
'74, they were the enemy.

00:30:58.292 --> 00:30:59.750 align:middle line:10%
>>They wanted a
weapons system they

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:04.300 align:middle line:10%
could put in space that would
stop a ballistic missile.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.520 align:middle line:90%
That was the concept.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Then terrorists
would be identified.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was soon to follow.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.868 align:middle line:90%
We heard a lot about terrorism.

00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:12.576 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, if that ballistic
missile happened

00:31:12.576 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to be coming from
another direction other

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:84%
than Earth-bound, could
it do the same thing?

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Then, we were going to
identify third-world country

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:90%
crazies.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:84%
We now call them
nations of concern.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:10%
>>I have but a short time
to try to convince people

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.190 align:middle line:10%
that we are moving
in an avenue where we

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:10%
are going to militarize space.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>The next enemy was asteroids.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And the funniest one of all
was against what he called

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:90%
aliens-- extraterrestrials.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:90%
That would be the final card.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>As a direct result, we
will become a threat to them

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.026 align:middle line:84%
unless we,
spiritually, grow also.

00:31:49.026 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>And over and over and
over, during the four years

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:84%
that I knew him, he would
bring up that last card.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And remember, Carol, the
last card is the alien card.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
build space-based weapons

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:90%
against aliens.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of it, he
said, is a lie.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:13.110 align:middle line:10%
>>We put nuclear weapons out
in space as a line of defense.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:10%
And we was ready to blow
them up if they started in.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.070 align:middle line:10%
>>Today, most people have come
to the very clear realization,

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.630 align:middle line:10%
I think, that things aren't
quite as you've been told.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And the question then, just
becomes, how big is the lie?

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is it's bigger
than most people can imagine.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the great things
about the NASA archive system

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:84%
is that, at the back of
many of their documents,

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.894 align:middle line:84%
they have both distribution
and reference lists.

00:32:39.894 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And the distribution
lists are very important.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:84%
They say who that document
is being forwarded to,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and which department
and from what company.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.970 align:middle line:10%
And when you begin to cull
through these documents--

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:10%
certainly ones that deal
with specific subject matter,

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.070 align:middle line:10%
like image enhancement,
for example--

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.970 align:middle line:10%
you begin to see a
lot of names that,

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.100 align:middle line:10%
obviously begin to repeat.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can very
quickly determine

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.780 align:middle line:84%
what individuals
knew what and had

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:84%
to have been privy to
certain information,

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:84%
just by the very
nature of their job.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.059 align:middle line:10%
The individual that
I managed to identify

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:10%
and who agreed to meet with me
and talk with me was a man who

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:10%
worked for a company called
BellComm during the 1960s

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.774 align:middle line:10%
and into the early 1970s.

00:33:17.774 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:10%
BellComm, although many
people haven't heard of it,

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:10%
is in many ways,
a company that is

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:10%
more responsible for
landing man on the moon

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:10%
than NASA really was.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:84%
BellComm's a division of
AT&T and Western Electric.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.980 align:middle line:10%
BellComm was around
for only a decade.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
They were there for
the specific purpose

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.640 align:middle line:84%
of landing man on
the moon and ensuring

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:90%
that NASA got the job done.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Meeting him was actually
the most incredible

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
three hours of my life,
the interview that we had.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
A man who I knew
was in the know,

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:90%
a man who I'd tracked down.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't, in any way, looking
to throw this stuff out

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.550 align:middle line:90%
in the public eye.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It was just, really,
a matter of him

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that I wasn't on a
total blind fishing expedition.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd actually
figured some things out.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.404 align:middle line:90%
That opened him up in a big way.

00:34:06.404 --> 00:34:08.653 align:middle line:84%
He made the comment several
times during the interview

00:34:08.653 --> 00:34:10.919 align:middle line:84%
that he'd never talked about
this with anyone before.

00:34:10.919 --> 00:34:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It was not the kind
of subject matter

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.659 align:middle line:90%
that you talk with anyone about.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:18.719 align:middle line:84%
The people that
were in a position

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to be in the know--
to have, at least,

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
some high level of
understanding of what was really

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.993 align:middle line:84%
going on-- these
individuals were also

00:34:26.993 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
very well aware of what
their government is actually

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:90%
capable of.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.510 align:middle line:10%
>>A guard told me that he was
asked to burn some photographs

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.254 align:middle line:10%
and not to look at them.

00:34:36.254 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:10%
And there was a guard--
another guard guarding

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.340 align:middle line:10%
him-- who was in green
fatigues, watching him

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.300 align:middle line:10%
burn the photographs.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.659 align:middle line:10%
And he said he was too tempted.

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:10%
He looked at one and it
was a picture of a UFO

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:10%
and he was very descriptive.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.889 align:middle line:10%
I can go into that
later with anyone.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:84%
He immediately was
hit in the head,

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and he had a big
gash in his forehead.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.690 align:middle line:90%
He was knocked out.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And he's terrified.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So he would have
to be protected.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Another incident-- I knew
someone in quarantine

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:90%
with the Apollo astronauts.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.414 align:middle line:84%
He told me that the Apollo
astronauts saw craft

00:35:10.414 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:90%
on the moon when we landed.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And that is what he told me.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And he also was afraid-- he
said that the astronauts are

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:90%
told to keep this quiet.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.160 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed
to talk about it.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So I do want to let you
know that I worked out there

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.790 align:middle line:84%
for a number of years,
and I ran into this.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something everyone
knows that works out there

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.180 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
My boss didn't know
about it, some people

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that sat right next to
me didn't know about it.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.689 align:middle line:84%
It's very strange because I
don't know how they can do it,

00:35:39.689 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:84%
but they can let some
people know about it,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:90%
and then others not.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to testify before
Congress that what I'm saying

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.730 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And thank you very much.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.192 align:middle line:84%
>>They know the power
of these people.

00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:53.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people ask
questions like, well,

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.275 align:middle line:84%
how come none of these people
who knew about it have ever

00:35:56.275 --> 00:35:57.380 align:middle line:90%
come forward?

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:84%
These individuals have
signed their lives away

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:84%
in security
classification documents.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.424 align:middle line:84%
And when I say sign
their lives away,

00:36:04.424 --> 00:36:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean that quite literally.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.631 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are things
that if they talk about,

00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:90%
it's off to Guantanamo Bay.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:14.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the greatest secret
in not only the United States

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.850 align:middle line:84%
military and the United
States government,

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.537 align:middle line:90%
but around the world.

00:36:19.537 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Really, for a lot of these
individuals-- and there

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:84%
are many other
investigators out there

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
who will tell you this--
one of the only ways

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.980 align:middle line:84%
these individuals have
to ever put the truth out

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:90%
is to do it through a proxy.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.810 align:middle line:84%
They find another individual or
another individual finds them.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And they talk a little
bit about what they know.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.500 align:middle line:84%
They're usually
very, very careful

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.750 align:middle line:84%
when they talk about it
because they don't want trails

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:90%
leading right back to them.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:84%
With this gentleman, I think
a great deal of his openness

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.790 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the fact
that he knew he was dying.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that
he was just fed up

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.610 align:middle line:90%
with the government's behavior.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So he was more than
willing-- knowing

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.870 align:middle line:84%
that I had understood at
least a little bit of what

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.360 align:middle line:84%
was going on-- he was much
more willing to open up to me.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>On November 20, 1969,
the Apollo 12 astronauts

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
did an experiment with
some strange results.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
They crashed the lunar
module ascent stage

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:90%
into the surface of the moon.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Shock waves reverberated
throughout the moon

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.880 align:middle line:90%
for over an hour.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Some have likened this
to ringing like a bell.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:84%
These results were repeated
during the Apollo 13 mission.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:84%
However, this time,
the shock waves

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:90%
lasted for over three hours.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Hollow Moon researchers
say that this is proof

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that the interior of the
moon was hollowed out

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:90%
by artificial means.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.960 align:middle line:84%
MITs Dr. Sean C. Solomon wrote,
"The Lunar Orbiter experiments

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.300 align:middle line:84%
vastly improved our knowledge of
the moon's gravitational field,

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.480 align:middle line:84%
indicating the
frightening possibility

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:90%
that the moon might be hollow."

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.280 align:middle line:84%
On March 7, 1971, instruments
placed on the moon

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.470 align:middle line:84%
by the Apollo
astronauts recorded

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.690 align:middle line:84%
a cloud of water vapor
passing over the surface.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:84%
The event lasted
for over 14 hours

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and covered an area of at
least 100 square miles.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.270 align:middle line:84%
The earth is thought to be
around 4.6 billion years old,

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
while rocks from the
moon were found to be

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:90%
around 5.3 billion years old.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And the dust the
rocks were found in

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:84%
is thought to be about a
billion years older than that.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:84%
This information
conflicts with the theory

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that the moon was produced
by a collision the earth

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.670 align:middle line:84%
had with another body
earlier in its history.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:45.709 align:middle line:90%


00:38:45.709 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:10%
>>One of the things that you've
got to keep in mind, as well,

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.750 align:middle line:10%
when you're looking
at NASA imagery,

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:10%
is that although the sky may
appear black in those frames,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:10%
in many instances, when
you enhance that image,

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:10%
you discover that
there is actually

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.620 align:middle line:10%
an incredible amount
of image detail

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.900 align:middle line:10%
that's just buried in the
darkness of that image.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.777 align:middle line:10%
But when you amplify
that scene and you

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:08.610 align:middle line:10%
begin to see what's
hidden there in the sky,

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:10%
you can begin to
make out shapes.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.670 align:middle line:10%
There's a few images
that show structuring.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:10%
And this is all done in an
effort to both hide the truth,

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.107 align:middle line:10%
but as well, to leave a bit
of the truth there for you.

00:39:22.107 --> 00:39:24.690 align:middle line:10%
And again, a lot of people don't
want to believe they do that.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:10%
But they do.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.170 align:middle line:10%
That's part of the dripping
faucet technique, where

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.660 align:middle line:10%
they give you tiny
little bits of the truth

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:10%
and you can begin to fill it
in-- fill it-- put it together

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:10%
for yourself.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.832 align:middle line:84%
One of the frames that
really demonstrates

00:39:38.832 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
the way they use this
dripping faucet technique

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:44.670 align:middle line:84%
is a frame known as 20680
from the Apollo 17 mission.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:84%
For 30 years, this
frame was officially

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
listed in their catalogs in the
Apollo 17 photographic index

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:84%
as being a blank-- no
image data-- frame.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:84%
A frame that has
got nothing on it.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
While this image
is most definitely

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.500 align:middle line:90%
sunstruck and overexposed.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Blank it most certainly is not.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:90%


00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:10%
>>Harrison Schmidt
created some patches

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:10%
for his own mission, Apollo 17,
which is, again, the mission

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:10%
that we take these images
from and that we've seen

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.920 align:middle line:10%
a lot of this color effect.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And what he put on it was
Stonehenge and the sun.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And the sun is a symbol of
ancient Egyptian god Horus.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:10%
There's all sorts of
Egyptian mythology

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.988 align:middle line:10%
that runs through all
the Apollo program, which

00:40:35.988 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:10%
is supposed to be
Greek, but it ends up

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:10%
that there's really a dual
meaning to all this stuff

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and it's Egyptian.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And what he's saying is-- what
he's clearly saying to people

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:10%
is look, these are ruins.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.190 align:middle line:10%
There is structure.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:10%
This is what we're
really doing on the moon.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:10%
And I think what
they're doing is

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.130 align:middle line:10%
they're trying, in a subtle
way, to let people know-- either

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:00.000 align:middle line:10%
because they remember
it subconsciously

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:10%
or because they are deliberately
trying to send us messages

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:10%
under the radar-- that they
did not go there and pick up

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:10%
a bunch of rocks.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But instead, what
they brought back,

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:84%
or what they were
sent to investigate,

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%
was ancient,
extraterrestrial ruins.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most
important things

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:84%
to keep in mind whenever you're
looking at any NASA imagery--

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.480 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Apollo
imagery or imagery of Mars,

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter--
perspective is everything.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:84%
We see human beings
down here on terra firma

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:84%
are afforded one
perspective of the moon.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:84%
We look at it and that's
what we have to look at.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the moon
looks like from the side

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.930 align:middle line:84%
or from different
oblique angles.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.600 align:middle line:84%
All we have is this
singular representation

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:90%
that we have to look at.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And NASA has, in fact,
gone to great lengths

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that the imagery
that they show us of the moon's

00:41:54.210 --> 00:42:00.240 align:middle line:84%
surface resembles very closely--
both in photometric function,

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.680 align:middle line:90%
as well as in angling.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And the dimensional
properties of the image

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:84%
make it appear as
if it would look

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.240 align:middle line:90%
just like it does from Earth.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary obfuscation
techniques that NASA uses

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:90%
is to simply rotate the imagery.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:10%
They insert a false horizon
in their oblique imagery.

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:23.230 align:middle line:10%
By turning these
images upside down,

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.410 align:middle line:10%
it alters-- vertical
objects suddenly

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:10%
don't cast shadows anymore.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The shadows aren't
in the right places.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And this technique has been
used since the dawn of the space

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.550 align:middle line:84%
age-- since the Lunar
Orbiter missions,

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.810 align:middle line:84%
since even before that
with Ranger missions--

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:44.032 align:middle line:84%
to make things appear as we
humans expect them to appear.

00:42:44.032 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we look through
a telescope here.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.073 align:middle line:90%
We say, oh, that's how it looks.

00:42:47.073 --> 00:42:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So from the side, it
probably looks like this.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.240 align:middle line:90%
The reality is it doesn't.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The moon is a very
three-dimensional object.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:10%
>>Hasselblad cameras
were the ones

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.410 align:middle line:10%
that were used by
NASA to photograph

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:10%
everything on the moon.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.545 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the
Hasselblad was used

00:43:02.545 --> 00:43:05.965 align:middle line:84%
was because they had
registration crosshairs.

00:43:05.965 --> 00:43:07.590 align:middle line:84%
These registration
crosshairs are there

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.100 align:middle line:90%
for a specific reason.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.970 align:middle line:84%
There so that you can
take a single photo

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:90%
with a single camera.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be able to get
distance from an object

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.790 align:middle line:84%
to another object because of
the registration crosshairs

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that are built into
the Hasselblad cameras.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.570 align:middle line:10%
These crosshairs are
always in front of whatever

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:10%
is being photographed.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a perfect shot
of a photograph of one

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.030 align:middle line:90%
of the astronauts on the moon.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, here you see the crosshairs
from the Hasselblad camera.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.910 align:middle line:84%
You can clearly see
that they are even

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.532 align:middle line:90%
in the darkness of space.

00:43:42.532 --> 00:43:46.730 align:middle line:10%
But you can clearly see that
the crosshairs are there

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.370 align:middle line:10%
in exactly the positions
they should be.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So in a lot of the
false horizons,

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:55.660 align:middle line:84%
they've eliminated the
crosshairs in the sky parts.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And almost about 90%
of the moon shots

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
have what we call
a false horizon.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:45:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.262 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1999, William Burrows wrote
a book called "This New Ocean."

00:45:08.262 --> 00:45:09.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-fictional
account-- supposedly

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:84%
non-fictional account--
of the space race.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.290 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
cover of that book,

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:18.190 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that he has a
picture of the earth's horizon

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:19.900 align:middle line:90%
on it with the moon above.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And on the cover
of this book, there

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.730 align:middle line:84%
are two black,
running parallel lines

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that climb up from
the earth and they

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.820 align:middle line:84%
pass the moon on either
side, paralleling it.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
when you go and look

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:34.660 align:middle line:84%
at the ISS and space
shuttle imagery of the moon

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:90%
from low Earth orbit.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:10%
When you begin to
enhance those images

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:44.390 align:middle line:10%
and begin to attack the black
area of the sky that appears

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:48.790 align:middle line:10%
to be solid black-- and
there are different filtering

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:52.390 align:middle line:10%
techniques you could use
to draw that out-- you

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:10%
begin to realize
that those lines that

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.080 align:middle line:10%
are on the cover of
his book actually

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:10%
are appearing in
these photographs.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
appear once or twice.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't see this
effect once or twice.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:05.470 align:middle line:84%
You see this in many,
many, many dozens

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:84%
of photographs that
are just of the moon.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.800 align:middle line:84%
They appear when you
enhance the image.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, Burroughs
knows something

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.800 align:middle line:90%
that the public's not privy to.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:84%
He's really just a
classic outsider-insider,

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.630 align:middle line:84%
very much like
Andrew Chaikin is.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:84%
He's a guy who knows what
the truth is but has agreed

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.810 align:middle line:84%
to perpetuate the lie,
rather than to reveal

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.920 align:middle line:84%
what the truth is for a
whole variety of reasons.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Burrows does a fantastic
job of presenting to us

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.240 align:middle line:84%
exactly the propaganda
and the story line

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that the powers at be
have been selling us

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:90%
as being the truth for decades.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And he gives the reader the
official historical cover story

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.270 align:middle line:90%
in brilliant details.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.860 align:middle line:84%
He's someone who is most
definitely in the know.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.350 align:middle line:84%
There are also frames in
which some of these lines

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:53.670 align:middle line:84%
appear to be behind the moon,
where you see the line rising

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.210 align:middle line:84%
up and being cut off as it
hits the lower limb of the moon

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.805 align:middle line:84%
before re-emerging again
on the exact opposite side

00:46:58.805 --> 00:47:00.180 align:middle line:84%
of that interception
point, where

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.760 align:middle line:84%
it continues on its very
straight, linear path.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And in these cases, you can
see that the lines do not

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.490 align:middle line:84%
transit in front of or
across the lunar disk,

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:90%
but rather, it's the opposite.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.840 align:middle line:84%
The moon appears to be
transiting and covering

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.960 align:middle line:90%
these lines.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on here?

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.330 align:middle line:10%
Why do all these NASA ISS frames
of the moon taken from LEO

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.110 align:middle line:10%
show these parallel lines.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And why does his book cover
mimic this same visual?

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.980 align:middle line:84%
What are we seeing and
what is being represented?

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.480 align:middle line:10%
One hypothesis I've
heard has to do

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.180 align:middle line:10%
with what are called
space elevators, which--

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.750 align:middle line:10%
as the name implies-- are
elevator transport systems that

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.800 align:middle line:10%
can be used to lift things--
satellites, cargo, spacecraft,

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:10%
people-- from the
surface of the Earth--

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.340 align:middle line:10%
lift those up into space.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, I realize that,
to many people,

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.240 align:middle line:84%
this idea of building
elevators with lengths

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.690 align:middle line:84%
of tens of thousands of
kilometers that could extend

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:54.440 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth's surface
up to geostationary orbit,

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.420 align:middle line:84%
or to the moon, probably
sounds ludicrous.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Something that, if it
is possible at all,

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.500 align:middle line:84%
must be centuries and
centuries beyond what

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.860 align:middle line:90%
we're capable of doing today.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But it really does not seem to
be as beyond state-of-the-art

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.004 align:middle line:90%
as one might think.

00:48:08.004 --> 00:48:10.170 align:middle line:10%
These are the kind of
projects being worked on today

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.550 align:middle line:10%
and funded today.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.950 align:middle line:10%
Back in 1999, NASA
sponsored what

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.390 align:middle line:10%
was called the space
elevator workshop.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And its purpose was to
explore the feasibility

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of the development of space
elevators in the 21st century.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And it discusses
plans for construction

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that would take place during
the later half of the century.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's all the
unclassified stuff.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.750 align:middle line:10%
That is with what they're
willing to tell us

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:32.791 align:middle line:10%
about their capabilities.

00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Were the Egyptian
pharaohs and clergymen

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of their time aware of
subterranean places that

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.710 align:middle line:90%
had celestial functions?

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:58.960 align:middle line:10%
Judging by hieroglyphics
that were discovered

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.750 align:middle line:10%
in tombs of pharaohs,
such as Ramses,

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.250 align:middle line:10%
one can see a
collaboration between what

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:08.370 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptians described in their
time as a stairway to heaven

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.310 align:middle line:10%
and what we are seeing now with
these space elevators emanating

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.930 align:middle line:10%
from Earth.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>The vector-- NASA's
official logo--

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.960 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever looked at
NASA's official logo--

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.010 align:middle line:84%
both their official insignia
and their official seal--

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.830 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the most
prominent object in the seal

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.910 align:middle line:90%
is a red, swishing object.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:84%
They call that the
chevron, or the vector.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.400 align:middle line:10%
If you ask NASA's public affairs
office that this symbology is

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.870 align:middle line:10%
featured so heavily in
their insignia and seal,

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.050 align:middle line:10%
they'll give you
what really amounts

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:42.240 align:middle line:10%
to the standard, facile cover
story for the unilluminated.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.530 align:middle line:10%
They'll tell you that
that is a representation

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:51.040 align:middle line:10%
of a hypersonic wing design
from the 1950s, which was

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.130 align:middle line:10%
the time the logo was created.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Not exactly the case.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Someone might want to ask
the Russian Federal Space

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Agency, Roscosmos, that
was formed in 1992, why

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.759 align:middle line:90%
they chose that same logo.

00:50:03.759 --> 00:50:05.175 align:middle line:84%
And while you're
at it, you can go

00:50:05.175 --> 00:50:09.000 align:middle line:84%
ask the Chinese, who formed
their space agency in 1996 why

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.840 align:middle line:84%
in the world they're
using a hypersonic wing

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
design from the 1950s
as their official logo.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.190 align:middle line:10%
Then, you can ask the Japanese,
the South Koreans, Taiwanese,

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:20.470 align:middle line:10%
Malaysia, Mexico, Iran.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.970 align:middle line:10%
All of these countries--
even Bulgaria-- they all

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:10%
utilize the vector symbology
in their space agency

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:10%
logos for their
national space agencies.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It gets even deeper.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.130 align:middle line:84%
You can go look at the
individual manned program

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.200 align:middle line:90%
patches for NASA.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.150 align:middle line:84%
The Mercury Program,
for example--

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:42.680 align:middle line:84%
a blatant use of
covert symbology.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.570 align:middle line:84%
In every logo dealing
with the Mercury Program,

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.860 align:middle line:84%
you'll see what looks like
a number 7 in their logo.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.219 align:middle line:10%
And again, NASA's
official story is

00:50:51.219 --> 00:50:52.760 align:middle line:10%
that they put this
number seven there

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:10%
so that they could pay homage
to the original seven Mercury

00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:00.430 align:middle line:10%
astronauts, forgetting the
fact that only six Mercury

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:02.680 align:middle line:10%
astronauts actually flew
into space because number

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.350 align:middle line:10%
seven never did.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:07.910 align:middle line:10%
Deke Slayton had a heart problem
so he didn't get to go up.

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So there were only six
Mercury astronauts.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there's a seven
in every single logo.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.980 align:middle line:84%
That's in the official mission
insig-- or official program

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.840 align:middle line:84%
insignia for Mercury, as well
as the six individual mission

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.200 align:middle line:90%
patches carried this logo.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.360 align:middle line:10%
And it carries on to the
space shuttle program.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:30.300 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Apollo
logo, the Apollo logo

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.620 align:middle line:90%
has a big letter A in it.

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.170 align:middle line:84%
At least that's what
they want you to believe.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.970 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's just a simple
way of explaining away

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.540 align:middle line:84%
the inclusion of this vector
symbology in the logo.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:44.515 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.515 --> 00:51:47.370 align:middle line:10%
If you go to the
space shuttle program,

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.910 align:middle line:10%
the original space shuttle STS
program patch was a triangular

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:55.380 align:middle line:10%
patch that, again, hides the
use of the chevronic vector

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.370 align:middle line:10%
symbology.

00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And that also goes for many
of the STS specific mission

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.820 align:middle line:90%
patches.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.020 align:middle line:10%
Every single one of the
International Space Station

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.760 align:middle line:10%
expedition patches carry
the vector symbology.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The Russian Mir space station
used the vector symbology.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.440 align:middle line:90%
That was their official logo.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
go deeper and look

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:17.367 align:middle line:84%
at military industrial
complex companies.

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Look at the logo on a company
like Lockheed Martin-- two

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.920 align:middle line:90%
vectors.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.470 align:middle line:10%
The XPRIZE logo, Ames Research
Labs, US Space Command,

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:middle line:10%
when you get into
the military realm.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.850 align:middle line:10%
The United States Space
Command-- their official logo

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.170 align:middle line:10%
is the vector symbol.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.960 align:middle line:10%
And when you look
at the military's

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.670 align:middle line:10%
individual space-specific
programs, all of them

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:42.310 align:middle line:10%
deal with the vector symbology
in their official insignias.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:44.620 align:middle line:10%
And the question
really becomes, who

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.740 align:middle line:10%
or what are these
people paying homage to?

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.880 align:middle line:10%
And the truth, quite frankly,
is out of this world.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:53:39.250 align:middle line:90%


00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>This painting, entitled "The
Madonna with Saint Giovannino"

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.430 align:middle line:84%
was made sometime
during the 1400s.

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The artist's name is not
known, but at first glance

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.240 align:middle line:84%
you can notice a
UFO shape in the sky

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.140 align:middle line:84%
to the right side
of the Madonna.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.880 align:middle line:84%
If you were to see the
original full-size painting,

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.320 align:middle line:84%
you would see the
object clearly.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the enlargement,
you can see a man and his dog

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.950 align:middle line:84%
standing and looking
up at the object.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:10.470 align:middle line:84%
However, this painting has
something else being depicted.

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:12.110 align:middle line:84%
On the left side
of the painting,

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:84%
you see the sun and
some vector-like objects

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.700 align:middle line:84%
seemingly flying from
or toward the sun.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this artist was
trying to tell us something.

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.550 align:middle line:84%
In another painting
of the Madonna made

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.590 align:middle line:84%
by a completely
different artist,

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:30.220 align:middle line:84%
the unusual patterns of the
sun and the vector-like symbols

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.960 align:middle line:84%
have also been
patted prominently

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.350 align:middle line:90%
on the Madonna's cloak.

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:36.250 align:middle line:84%
You can see the same
symbology on this painting

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.840 align:middle line:90%
as on the one before.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.750 align:middle line:84%
This time, however,
there is no UFO object

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:45.180 align:middle line:90%
to be seen anywhere in the sky.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.800 align:middle line:84%
This footage was taken
over Mexico City in 2002.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.890 align:middle line:84%
There were many other
videos and photographs

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:54.960 align:middle line:84%
taken of this same
type of object,

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.310 align:middle line:84%
clearly resembling
the shapes as seen

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.425 align:middle line:84%
on the visor of the
astronaut on the moon

00:55:00.425 --> 00:55:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and depicted in the
14th century paintings

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Madonna and child.

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.550 align:middle line:10%
There is probably a larger
story behind the vectors,

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:13.360 align:middle line:10%
but it is very unusual this
symbology has been adapted

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.770 align:middle line:10%
by all the United States
and foreign space agencies,

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:19.950 align:middle line:10%
especially enemies like
Iran and others who are also

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:24.150 align:middle line:10%
making missions to the moon.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.638 align:middle line:90%
>>Final control, Houston.

00:55:25.638 --> 00:55:28.614 align:middle line:84%
Switching now to the
voice of Jim Lovell.

00:55:28.614 --> 00:55:29.606 align:middle line:90%
>>By 60.5.

00:55:29.606 --> 00:55:32.086 align:middle line:90%
Good to hear your voice.

00:55:32.086 --> 00:55:33.574 align:middle line:90%
>>Apollo 8, Houston.

00:55:33.574 --> 00:55:36.054 align:middle line:84%
What does the old moon
look like from 60 miles?

00:55:36.054 --> 00:55:37.542 align:middle line:90%
Over.

00:55:37.542 --> 00:55:39.526 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, Houston.

00:55:39.526 --> 00:55:42.198 align:middle line:90%
The moon is, essentially, gray.

00:55:42.198 --> 00:55:42.998 align:middle line:90%
No color.

00:55:42.998 --> 00:56:00.420 align:middle line:90%


00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>It's so unbelievably
beautiful.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:06.250 align:middle line:84%
All these natural colors
that exist out there

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:07.970 align:middle line:90%
has never been shown to us.

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I've seen, on TV, the
moon is gray and black

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and it has no color.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, that couldn't be
farther from the truth.

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It's really-- it's compelling.

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.540 align:middle line:90%
I just want to see more.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And it blew me away.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:25.660 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely blew me away.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.493 align:middle line:84%
>>First of all, with
the Clementine Mission,

00:56:27.493 --> 00:56:30.250 align:middle line:84%
they took 1.8 million
images of the moon.

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.400 align:middle line:84%
The high-resolution ones-- you
can't seem to get any of them

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.585 align:middle line:84%
because-- well, they give
you different reasons why

00:56:35.585 --> 00:56:37.710 align:middle line:84%
you can't get them, but
you can't seem to get them.

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But there's also these
natural color images.

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are much,
much brighter.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.380 align:middle line:84%
They have far more
color than they should

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.127 align:middle line:84%
if our models of
them are correct.

00:56:45.127 --> 00:56:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's two ways
you can approach this.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.050 align:middle line:84%
One, is it could very well
be that some of these areas--

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.550 align:middle line:84%
let's say some of these areas
under these glass structures--

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.816 align:middle line:90%
these domes-- are still intact.

00:56:55.816 --> 00:56:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That there's still
atmosphere in there.

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That there is still
stuff growing there.

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:02.355 align:middle line:84%
You would, obviously, have
plants and vegetation.

00:57:02.355 --> 00:57:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You'd have various things there
that you would need to survive

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:08.090 align:middle line:84%
or that you would have simply
for the aesthetics of living

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.570 align:middle line:84%
in an environment with
plants and animals.

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that's
what some of the stuff is.

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.500 align:middle line:10%
Another distinct
possibility-- and this

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.000 align:middle line:10%
is the one that I
tend to advocate--

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.360 align:middle line:10%
is that if you really do have
these multiple layers of glass

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.960 align:middle line:10%
structures all over the
moon, what's going to happen

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.710 align:middle line:10%
is the light is going to scatter
and bounce all over the place.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.790 align:middle line:10%
And when it does that,
you get a prism effect.

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And it, then, will combine
with other red or green or blue

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and it will make other colors.

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>In order to comprehend
the significance

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:40.310 align:middle line:84%
about the natural
color of the moon,

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:43.460 align:middle line:84%
you need to know where
these images come from.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what is called
the skin of the moon.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:48.160 align:middle line:10%
It is the actual
surface that has been

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.400 align:middle line:10%
stretched and flattened out.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.420 align:middle line:84%
When visual artists
wrap this skin

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:56.902 align:middle line:84%
around a sphere in their 3D
programs, this is what you get.

00:57:56.902 --> 00:57:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Jose Escamilla
downloaded hundreds

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.760 align:middle line:84%
of sections of the entire skin
that is available on the USGS

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.210 align:middle line:90%
website.

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The area of interest is in
this section here, located

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:11.096 align:middle line:90%
on the front side of the moon.

00:58:11.096 --> 00:58:14.180 align:middle line:84%
When Jose zoomed into
this particular section,

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.850 align:middle line:84%
he recognized some
very unusual features

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.150 align:middle line:90%
and objects in the scene.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.250 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the terrain below
is clearly presenting itself

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:24.210 align:middle line:90%
at an angular view.

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The disk shape,
located here, appears

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to be hovering
above the surface.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.150 align:middle line:84%
When you compare
this disk with others

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that are closer to
the terrain, you

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:36.860 align:middle line:84%
can clearly see this object
is not down on the terrain.

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Jose found out very quickly that
there are more of these disks

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.050 align:middle line:90%
all over the moon.

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:44.100 align:middle line:84%
The disks that you will
see in other photos we

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.330 align:middle line:84%
are going to present are
identical to this one.

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:49.470 align:middle line:84%
They are hovering
on their sides,

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they are
hovering as these others below.

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:57.210 align:middle line:84%
The other disks you will see are
different in color and details,

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.260 align:middle line:84%
but they are shining light
onto the lunar surface,

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:04.010 align:middle line:84%
as they do whatever they are
doing close to the terrain.

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.690 align:middle line:84%
In all the photos Jose
presents in this film,

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:10.100 align:middle line:84%
you are seeing the only clear
and detailed photography

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.460 align:middle line:84%
ever released in full color
of real flying saucers.

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.940 align:middle line:84%
NASA has known this and so
have the multitudes of people

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.980 align:middle line:90%
connected to the space program.

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.350 align:middle line:10%
>>Another thing that I
need to bring forth is,

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:26.540 align:middle line:10%
in my first film-- "UFO-- The
Greatest Story Ever Denied"--

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:30.200 align:middle line:10%
we had this whole segment on the
STS footage of the things that

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.380 align:middle line:10%
are flying to the tether.

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.200 align:middle line:10%
Things that have the donut hole.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.340 align:middle line:10%
But they seem to be alive.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.250 align:middle line:10%
I come to find out
that these things are

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.580 align:middle line:10%
thriving on the moon's surface.

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:40.280 align:middle line:90%
There are thousands of them.

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're hovering
above the moon's surface.

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Finding the full color
imagery that you're

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:47.900 align:middle line:84%
looking at now-- the
natural colors of the moon--

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.160 align:middle line:84%
it brings us to a
totally new reality

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that the moon could have
been teeming with life back

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.410 align:middle line:84%
in '94 when these
photos were taken,

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:57.250 align:middle line:84%
or it may still be
teeming with life.

00:59:57.250 --> 01:01:16.200 align:middle line:90%


01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And the truth
is, once you look

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:21.430 align:middle line:84%
at these pictures
of the moon or Mars,

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
this stuff is structure--

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that there is artificial
structures there-- pretty

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:30.340 align:middle line:90%
much everything's on the table.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>There are so many
lunar landscapes

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
filled with color and textures
unlike anything ever seen

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:39.570 align:middle line:90%
before with the human eye.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
There are deep
crevices and overhangs

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
where you can see
immensely huge openings,

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.800 align:middle line:84%
or what appear to
be cavern entrances.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
There are far too many
gigantic and massive structures

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.940 align:middle line:90%
as can be described.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
You have to see
them for yourself

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
in order to grasp the
size of these complex

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and, in most cases,
alien-like architecture,

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.650 align:middle line:90%
as you have seen in many films.

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:05.690 align:middle line:84%
You will even see some
strange vine-like webbing,

01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
as depicted in Steven
Spielberg's "War

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.380 align:middle line:90%
of the Worlds."

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Glass domes, UFOs,
massive buildings,

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and scaffolding spread
throughout the lunar terrain

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:18.940 align:middle line:84%
in many sizes,
shapes, and forms.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.170 align:middle line:84%
It is evident the
missions to the moon

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
were more involved than
gathering rocks and dirt

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:24.930 align:middle line:90%
samples.

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
There is no doubt
we went to the moon.

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It is what was waiting
for us when we got there

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:31.560 align:middle line:90%
that this film is about.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:03:20.330 align:middle line:90%


01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Finding the full-color
imagery that you're

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:25.635 align:middle line:84%
looking at now-- the
natural colors of the moon--

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
it brings us to a
totally new reality

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that the moon could have
been teeming with life back

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
in '94 when these
photos were taken,

01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:35.080 align:middle line:84%
or it may still be
teeming with life.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.790 align:middle line:10%
>>I think they are still there.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:40.410 align:middle line:10%
They were there in the
'70s when the last Apollo

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.820 align:middle line:10%
mission was there.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I found lights on.

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems that, at least
in some areas of the moon,

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.544 align:middle line:84%
that the lights
might still be on.

01:03:49.544 --> 01:04:09.940 align:middle line:90%


01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>We're talking
about the covering up

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of hyperadvanced technology
that could do away

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.170 align:middle line:84%
with fossil fuels-- our
dependence on fossil fuels.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
technology that

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
allows for much quicker
transport through space

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.637 align:middle line:90%
than we've ever been told.

01:04:28.637 --> 01:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>What I think has happened is
that all these other countries,

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
somehow, have found out
that we went there--

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that we brought back this
technology, that we're

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:38.200 align:middle line:90%
exploiting this technology.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And they want a
piece of the action.

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.112 align:middle line:10%
So that's why-- it's the only
reason why they would spend

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:45.570 align:middle line:10%
the kind of money that they're
spending-- India, China, all

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:47.890 align:middle line:10%
these-- Japan-- all
these countries--

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:49.360 align:middle line:10%
to go back to the moon.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.160 align:middle line:90%
To what?

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
To collect rocks?

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.060 align:middle line:84%
No, they're going back
there because there's

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
something incredibly
valuable there

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that they know that we have--
the United States brought

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
back-- that they
want a piece of.

01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:02.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's a tremendous risk.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.795 align:middle line:84%
There's not just simply the
risk to the astronauts lives.

01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
There's-- if you believe
some of the stories--

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
there's even a risk to other
people that might already be

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:12.710 align:middle line:90%
there.

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>And the end
result, I have found

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
that the moon is in full color.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not a black
and white object.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not made of impact
craters and this kind of thing.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.340 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more to it.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.870 align:middle line:84%
NASA has deliberately tempered
a lot of the photography.

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:30.930 align:middle line:10%
They've eliminated
the crosshairs

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.940 align:middle line:10%
to eliminate what was in
the background in the sky

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.930 align:middle line:10%
or in the landscapes.

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
very significant things

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:38.980 align:middle line:90%
that have occurred.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
All we say-- we don't
know the answers.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.216 align:middle line:84%
>>In this whole realm,
none of us-- none

01:05:44.216 --> 01:05:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of these individual
researchers--

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily Jose,
not Richard and I,

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
not-- we don't have
all the answers.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Various-- we all have
a piece of the puzzle.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
We all see different
parts of it.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain aspects of
this that we're all good at.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>All I'm presenting
to you-- and it's

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:03.170 align:middle line:84%
backed up with facts-- all my
films present you with evidence

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.490 align:middle line:90%
that is fully acknowledged.

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:06.950 align:middle line:90%
You can back trace it.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
You can do, as they say, back
engineer everything I present.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all there for you to see.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.796 align:middle line:84%
>>What we do know
is that there's

01:06:13.796 --> 01:06:14.920 align:middle line:90%
more information out there.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, there's 1.8
million Clementine images

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:18.770 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the web.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:22.885 align:middle line:84%
No one person can access
even a handful of those

01:06:22.885 --> 01:06:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and look at them and study
them and find stuff on them.

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
What we need is for people
that see these films

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and see documentaries
like this to understand

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.580 align:middle line:90%
that this stuff does exist.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.230 align:middle line:90%
They can't hide it all.

01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was talking with
the gentleman from BellComm

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and we were discussing
the lie, everything

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
he was telling me was different
from what we were being told

01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:49.390 align:middle line:90%
was the truth.

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I asked him--
I said, man, you guys lied

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
about a lot, didn't you?

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:56.582 align:middle line:90%
And instantly, he said, no.

01:06:56.582 --> 01:06:58.040 align:middle line:84%
We didn't lie about
certain things.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.090 align:middle line:90%
We lied about everything.

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:01.340 align:middle line:90%
None of it was true.

01:07:01.340 --> 01:14:49.901 align:middle line:90%


01:14:49.901 --> 01:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>And we have vowed
that we shall not

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
see a governed by a
hostile flag of conquest,

01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
but by a banner of
freedom and peace.

01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
We have vowed that
we shall not see

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:09.050 align:middle line:84%
space filled with weapons
of mass destruction,

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:12.706 align:middle line:84%
but with instruments of
knowledge and understanding.

01:15:12.706 --> 01:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Yet the vows of
this nation can only

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
be fulfilled if we, in
this nation, are first.

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
intend to be first.

01:15:24.330 --> 01:19:11.594 align:middle line:90%
