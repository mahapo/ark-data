00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have
that tight feeling.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> People love big houses
on quiet green patches,

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and they are willing to
accept some of the trade-offs.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But they don't fully understand
some of the trade-offs.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Driving, economic impacts of
that lifestyle, time, obesity,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
social disconnection,
those things

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
are becoming more clear
that suburban patterns

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:90%
can create those problems.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.808 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
If you think about a village
300 years ago wherever that was,

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:90%
people walked everywhere.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
They maybe had a cart,
they maybe had a horse.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a natural
pattern of connectedness

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and accessibility
to everything they

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
needed-- food, labor, and
entertainment, and everything

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.298 align:middle line:90%
>> I grew up in the UK.

00:09:43.298 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a little
village of 500 people

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and took for granted
the fact that--

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:90%
we had a shop just up the road.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We had greenspace
on our doorstep.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
We knew our neighbors really
well along our street.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
We had a church at
the top of the street.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So we had in this
ancient little village

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
almost a school, a place where
the community could congregate.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We had this incredible
mix of uses.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And you could almost live out
your daily life in that village

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and not need to
go anywhere else.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But the car has made
it possible to travel huge

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
distances, to go
to edge conditions,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and live in beautiful forests.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But you can't provide
entertainment, shops,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:90%
services in the same way.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So people move around
a lot more and they

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
are locked into driving
more than anything else.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:10%
And in addition to
driving, which puts you

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:10%
in a car, some people three
hours a day every day,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:10%
which you could use for family,
for work, or for health,

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.353 align:middle line:10%
and sport, you're now in a car.

00:10:40.353 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do in a car?

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:90%
You sit and perhaps you eat.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a different
impact on your health.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're in a car you're
surrounded and separated

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:90%
by a whole bunch of metal.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You're very unlikely to
interact with the people

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:90%
you see around you.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what you're
probably likely to do

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is shout at the cyclist or
shout at the pedestrian who's

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:90%
getting in your way right.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.012 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you're in
transit or you're cycling

00:11:03.012 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
or you're walking,
you're much more

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:84%
likely to have eye
contact with people.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just
a casual glance,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
there's a humanity about that
interaction and relationship,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
which is not seen
when you're just

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:90%
driving a car past each other.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Cities that grow in a sprawl
pattern have to build very

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
expensive sewer and
transportation and other forms

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:90%
of infrastructure.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they disperse all
their economic activity

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and their housing
and then people

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
have to drive around to get
the things they want and work.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to huge
pollution, energy use,

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:90%
and health issues.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first came
to North America,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
it was actually quite a shock
to see how separated uses were.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we build these
huge residential subdivisions,

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
we build these huge
commercial shopping malls,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
we build these huge
industrial estates,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're separated
and just the volume

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
of traffic that generates, and
the fact that really it's very

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.907 align:middle line:90%
difficult to walk anywhere.

00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to create ecological
cities where the impacts are

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
lower within the
cities themselves,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
but also we're not
spreading as much

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
into the surrounding landscape
and the surrounding habitats.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> If not designed well, suburbs
can lead to urban sprawl which

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
has a detrimental effect on both
the environment and our sense

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:90%
of community.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
While suburbs continue
to quickly expand,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
they aren't the only
housing choice in demand.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Condominiums have become
a popular housing option

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
among both younger
and older generations.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:84%
They can offer proximity to
neighbors and accessibility

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:90%
to services.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But can condo living provide
that feeling of community

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
that is so essential
to our well being?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:84%
To find out more
about this, I decided

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
to meet up with
someone who lives

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:90%
in a populated urban area.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%
This is Kirsten.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
She lives in a multi-unit
condo building in Vancouver.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Through our discussions,
she expressed

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that despite being in
a safe neighborhood

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and having modern amenities in
her building, she rarely sees,

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
let alone interacts
with her neighbors.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
As a result, feels
like the building

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:90%
lacks a sense of community.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's nice to know people when
you're walking down the street

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and have interesting
conversations and sort of be

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
more connected to your community
rather than just coming

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
in and coming out going
to different places,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:middle line:84%
living your busy
day-to-day life.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> In itself, condominiums
are not the answer.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, they can be part
of the problem of isolation.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But designed well, they can
be part of the solution.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So it really is a
question of the quality

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
of design both of
the building itself,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:84%
how it relates to the
street and how it relates

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:90%
to its surrounding open space.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:84%
There's very little
space for people

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:84%
to interact in that kind of
typical apartment building

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:90%
or condominium building.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So you come out, you've got
this very black bear corridor,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:84%
you walk to the elevator,
you're down to the parking lot

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
usually, you're in your car,
and then you're off to work.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
very few places that

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
are designed for intentionally
congregating and mixing

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and bumping into people.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know that we've
designed our high rises well

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:10%
enough to encourage
that form of community.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Often people see each
other as kind of they

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
have to line up behind others
to get on the elevator.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have the right
kind of common spaces.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Even if you wanted to
borrow sugar from the person

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
downstairs, you have to phone in
and get security clearance just

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
to go down to the
next door neighbor.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We've heard the thing,
fences make great neighbors.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like as long
as I know what my space is,

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll interact and
engage with you.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
But you've got to know my space.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if an apartment
that doesn't work that way.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not imposing solitary
confinement on people,

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.570 align:middle line:84%
but we are designing places that
make it difficult to interact

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
with people, which amounts
to a similar thing.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So through design we're
creating isolation

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and we're creating separation.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I ask people, how many
of you know your neighbor?

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
There it's usually about a
half now their neighbors.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I ask, how many of you know
the last name of your neighbor?

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.605 align:middle line:90%
And it's probably 10%.

00:15:32.605 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you happen to know
any of your neighbors on that

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.805 align:middle line:90%
street?

00:15:35.805 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I do not at this point.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I've lived there
for about six weeks,

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and I know the gentleman
that lives below me.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In my apartment building,
people don't even like make eye

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:90%
contact with me.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.977 align:middle line:84%
When I pass them
at the hall, they

00:15:47.977 --> 00:15:51.765 align:middle line:84%
look away instead of trying
to even give a basic greeting.

00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Even the further you go up,
the further high you're living,

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:84%
the further detached you
are from your community,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, or
anybody around you.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very important, I
think, that sense of community

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and the security that brings
when you know people who are

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.773 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean by security?

00:16:08.773 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't
know your neighbors,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what
kind of people they are.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't even think I'm
going to live in this community

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle line:90%
for more than a year or two.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.078 align:middle line:84%
So maybe when I'm
a little bit older,

00:16:17.078 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a family, kids,
and everything else,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:90%
then it'll be important.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But for right now,
I'd rather just

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.825 align:middle line:84%
communicate with the people
that I find important in life

00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:26.967 align:middle line:84%
rather than helping
a community or trying

00:16:26.967 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to work on a community
that I might not even

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:90%
live in in a year from now.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, Winston
Churchill famously said,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
we shape our buildings, and
then our buildings shape us.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The same is true of our
cities and our neighborhoods.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:90%
We shape our neighborhoods.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
We shape our cities, and then
our cities shape us back.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And so in many
ways, our cities are

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of our thinking and
our culture and our paradigms,

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
if you like, about
how we see the world

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and how we see our relationship
amongst each other.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We no longer
have front porches.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
why that happened.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Was it the garage that took over
the front porch and the fact

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that people like to just drive
in, close the door behind them?

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%
But what that means is that
when people are going for walks,

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:84%
they don't see one
another anymore.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
Front yards are
often just lawns.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:84%
Our backyards are where we
often create the greatest oasis,

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't-- we don't have
a natural connection with one

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, other
things start to break down.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> If you feel connected to your
neighborhood, to your place,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
you feel like it's
your community.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
If you don't feel
connected to it,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
you feel like it's just
a place where you live.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
If you feel connected to the
people in that neighborhood,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:84%
you feel like those
people are your community.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you probably
feel like your community

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
are actually a group
of people spread

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
throughout the city who are
your friends and acquaintances.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're seeing this
renewal all around the world

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
where neighborhoods are
becoming far more important,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
both in city planning but also
just citizens saying I want

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:90%
to know my neighbor.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to be in a
neighborhood that's safe.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to be in a
place that's fun.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's good for me.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It's great for my
kids and guess what

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.648 align:middle line:84%
neighborhoods with a sense of
community land values go up.

00:18:22.648 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Lots of people
are realizing that.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is
actually those places

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:90%
are becoming more expensive.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:90%
They're becoming gentrified.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:84%
They're becoming the most
popular spaces in cities.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
We're actually underproviding
those kind of places

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:90%
right now in a big way.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's what's driving
the lack of affordability

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:84%
in many of our world
cities like Vancouver,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
like San Francisco,
like New York,

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
London because people
are really demanding

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
the neighborhoods that
are mixed use and have

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that public amenity, that
public open space, and then

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.387 align:middle line:90%
great urban design.

00:18:54.387 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>> We've been looking at houses.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And like why be in this little
cookie-cutter neighborhood

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:90%
where maybe you're like--

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Two people in a
6,000 square foot house?

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's ridiculous.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's completely ridiculous.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.588 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's like no
one needs that space,

00:19:05.588 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:90%
but you need people.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Although we are
social beings by nature,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
it's been reported that one
third of Americans never reach

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
out to their neighbors, and more
and more people are choosing

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:90%
to live alone.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Since the design
of our communities

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
can hinder opportunities for
interaction, which negatively

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
affects our being, it
becomes vitally important

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that we create our
own opportunities

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:90%
to connect with others.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.452 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.452 --> 00:19:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Being a part of one's
community is very rewarding,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:90%
but it can also--

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- it's not
always easy to get

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:84%
involved when you yourself
have been at the outskirts.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that's one
of the most reliable routes

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:90%
to happiness.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> When I move into a condo,
I'm going to organize my floor

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
first, and then I'm going to
start to organize the whole

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But if I can get
my floor organized

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and people hear us having
fun and suddenly they

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
hear from others, gee, if
you lived on floor nine, what

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
a great time you'd
have, I wish I

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:90%
could have that kind of floor.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
it takes, ultimately.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there's a lot
of interesting people here that

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get to know more,
and I think that we kind

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:84%
of take for granted the
situation that we live

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.562 align:middle line:84%
in because I think that
the building is so cool.

00:20:26.562 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:90%
The rooftop is so cool.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
If we could have monthly
gatherings or more

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
regular get-togethers I think
that would be really nice.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Surveys report that
when buying a condo,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:84%
amenities like rooftop patios
and party rooms are in high

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:90%
demand.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But how often do we
really see these spaces

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:90%
being used to socialize?

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Wanting to help Kirsten to
get to know her neighbors

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to make use of
the building's common spaces,

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I convinced her to throw a party
on the rooftop of her condo.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Kirsten, how are you?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It's Tamaran.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
How are you feeling
about the dates?

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Which date worked
better for you?

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.285 align:middle line:10%
And let's take it from that?

00:21:09.285 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, you invite
people, and they just come.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.785 align:middle line:84%
And it can be like
standing room.

00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:90%
And people can then just mingle.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Kirsten, can I tell you how
thankful we are for this?

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be awesome.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
We got a candidate.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Kirsten was up for the
challenge of taking

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the first step to meeting her
neighbors, which is admirable.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But the big question is, will
the people in our building

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
be willing to come out
and get to one another?

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Most of us would say
we enjoy socializing,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:90%
yet we don't make it a priority.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that families are
having 60% fewer family picnics

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and 40% fewer family dinners
than just a few decades ago.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
In the late '70s,
the average American

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
entertained friends at
home about 14 times a year.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's half that.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
While it's true that many of
us commute and work more hours

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
than we did in the
past, some stats

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:84%
showing that almost
all professionals work

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
at least 50 hours a
week, and nearly half

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:90%
work more than 65 hours.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a greater
issue here, one

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that's concerned with
how we value our time.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the 19th century, the
ability to afford leisure time

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:90%
was a badge of honor.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, that badge
has been replaced

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.883 align:middle line:90%
with shackles of busyness.

00:22:42.883 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Like you want to go
and visit with friends.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.675 align:middle line:10%
Like you've got a book
two months in advance.

00:22:46.675 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:10%
Like they might only
live 10 minutes away.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:10%
So the challenge has really been
how can you create community

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.190 align:middle line:10%
in a very fast-paced
environment that

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:10%
has a lot of external
stresses on it?

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's probably true
over the last 40 years

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:10%
that societies have become
more individualistic,

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.540 align:middle line:10%
and people have been more
concerned with themselves

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:10%
doing something.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:84%
This is my time developing
something for me

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and defining it often in terms
of things, incomes, capacity

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to achieve, getting houses,
getting cars, and so on,

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
defining success that way,
in part, because that's

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the way the commercial
economy, in part, is set up

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
in order to make it look like
you'll be happier if you've

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%

on a fancy cruise or whatever.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that levees
a cost on people.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The notion of Independence
comes from greater affluence

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:90%
in Western society.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Every time we become
more affluent,

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
we use it to purchase
greater independence.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So independence is kind of
the offshoot of affluence,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and our increasing affluence,
increasing independence moves

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
us into greater and
greater isolation.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Money and making more money
helps us live a better life

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
to a point, but connectedness
actually drives happiness

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.947 align:middle line:90%
on a direct line.

00:24:27.947 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The more you know people,
the more connected

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:84%
you are to your
friends and neighbors.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:90%
The happier you are.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's a direct connection.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And in many societies,
increased income

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
actually leads to social
isolation, stress,

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:90%
and ill health.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.758 align:middle line:90%
So actually, happiness drops.

are your most rewarding aspects

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:10%

it's the social relationships.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But when push comes
to shove, I think

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:84%
when people are making decisions
about their time, day-to-day,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.295 align:middle line:84%
we don't always stack our
time in that same manner.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:90%
old, and that is connection.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.645 align:middle line:84%
My god, who's going to come
visit me when I'm sick?

00:25:15.645 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Just think about
that for a moment.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I'm most
vulnerable, when I'm dying.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And the investment that
you put in today, just

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
like financial planning, it
will reap you so many awards

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:90%
going into your future.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a lovely analogy.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying don't plan
financially, but just

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.725 align:middle line:84%

community, without friends.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that by placing
importance on our drive

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
for wealth and status, by
having a time as money mindset,

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
we are inadvertently using
a rise in income to purchase

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:90%
loneliness.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And taking it one step further,
how we generate this income

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and grow our economies
can have a negative impact

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:90%
on our society as a whole.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:10%
>> When Simon Kuznets, who
was one of the lead architects

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:10%
of the GDP in the
1930s, developed it,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.780 align:middle line:10%
he said to the US Senate that it
shouldn't be used as a measure

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:10%
of social progress, and yet
that's exactly what we do.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So what we're interested
in is how do you grow all

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:90%
those other things that matter?

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
One way to think about
it is that there's

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:90%
different forms of capital.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about
economic capital.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:10%
And everybody thinks
that capitalism

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:10%
is about economic capital,
but the green or alternative

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:10%
economists would tell
you that there's at least

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:10%
three other forms of capital.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.550 align:middle line:90%
There's human capital.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:84%
What are my assets, capacity,
abilities, and collectively,

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
what's our assets,
capacities, and abilities?

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:10%
Then there's social
capital, which

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:10%
is about how we interact with
each other, the social networks

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.510 align:middle line:10%
that we build, the social
systems that we build.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
natural capital,

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
which is nature of
the resources, the way

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:90%
our ecosystems function.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
In the 21st century,
real capitalism

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is about building all four forms
of capital at the same time.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:10%
And we have a rather
distorted version of capital

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:10%
that says that we're only
going to grow economic capital.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:10%
That's all that matters.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:10%
In the process, we damage
or destroy natural capital.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We damage or destroy
social capital.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:10%
When you look at what's happened
to the outsourcing of jobs

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:10%
to the destruction of
businesses to the destruction

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.560 align:middle line:10%
of communities in the
pursuit of economic capital,

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:10%
and then we harm
individuals because we're

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:10%
harming human capital when
we destroy social capital

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:10%
or natural capital.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.040 align:middle line:10%
So we're growing
one form of capital

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:10%
at the expense of the others.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm sorry, but
that's very antiquated

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:10%
19th-century economic thinking.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work in
the 21st century.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And so real capitalism is
about how do you simultaneously

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
build human, social, natural,
and economic capital?

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't do that,
you're not a real capitalist

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:90%

What could be maybe
not communicated

00:31:15.042 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:84%
because we're spending time
on our phone or something

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.050 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Parents text and do email at
breakfast and at dinner while

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:84%
their children complain about
not having their parents' full

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.250 align:middle line:90%
attention.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But then these same
children deny each other

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:90%
their full attention.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies reveal that we check
our phones anywhere from 47

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:90%
to 82 times a day.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:84%
We bring them
everywhere with us,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:84%
from the breakfast table to
the bedroom, which intrudes

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.490 align:middle line:90%
on our real-life interactions.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
One study reported
that 70% of women

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.260 align:middle line:84%
believe that smartphones
were negatively

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:90%
impacting their relationships.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:84%
There's even a term for
this interference fubbing,

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:03.240 align:middle line:84%
which is defined as snubbing
a person in favor of a phone.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:84%
To no one's surprise, the
more we engage in fubbing,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the less available we are
to the people around us.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And the same can be true
for online interactions.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:84%
As Sherry Turkle
states, the ties

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:84%
we form through the
internet are not

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:90%
in the end the ties that bind.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Texting, email, posting, all
of these things let us present

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:90%
the self as we want to be.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
We get to edit, and that
means we get to delete.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And that means we get to retouch
the face, the voice, the flesh,

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:48.725 align:middle line:84%
the body, not too little,
not too much, just right.

00:32:48.725 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Lots of people want to
showcase themselves through

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:90%
social media.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.538 align:middle line:84%
So they build up this
persona of themselves,

00:32:55.538 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and they spend a
lot of time crafting

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that persona of
themselves rather than

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
actually going out and meeting
people and doing things.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that while it's really
nice to be connected to people

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:84%
in different cities,
like family and friends,

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
it's not as beneficial to the
people that are around you

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
if you're stuck communicating to
people that are not around you.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the interaction
online is also very brief 10,

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.483 align:middle line:84%
20, 30 seconds, a
few minutes, maybe.

00:33:22.483 --> 00:33:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not like sitting down
and having lunch or going

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to the pub and having
a beer where you spend

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.835 align:middle line:90%
a couple of hours together.

00:33:28.835 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Over and over, I hear I
would rather text than talk.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing is
that people get so used

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to being shortchanged
out of real conversation,

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.710 align:middle line:84%
so used to getting by
with less that they

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:84%
become almost
willing to dispense

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.760 align:middle line:90%
with people altogether.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.560 align:middle line:10%
>> When you spend less time
interacting face to face with

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:10%
individuals, you sort of-- if
we think about that interaction

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:10%
as a form of exercise that helps
us know how to communicate with

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:10%
the other-- each other and
keep that communication working

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:10%
in a healthy way, then we're
not getting as much of that

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:10%
exercise as maybe we need.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I do worry, particularly
for younger generations.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they getting
that social exercise

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that they need to learn
how to communicate

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:16.715 align:middle line:90%
with others in the world?

00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
>> We did have the advantage
of getting use of a very large

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Canadian survey.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.537 align:middle line:84%
And they were asked how big is
their network of real friends,

00:34:26.537 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and they were asked how
big is their network

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:90%
of online friends.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was a significant
dose response relationship

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:84%
of a positive sort
for real friends.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
The bigger your
network, the more

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:84%
satisfied you were with
your life as a whole.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:47.480 align:middle line:84%
The effect of the online friends
was either zero or negative.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And now, the negative one,
you say, how could that be?

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:84%
One part it's like
watching television.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.592 align:middle line:84%
You may like to watch television
and get something out of it,

00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:57.800 align:middle line:84%
but once you get into it,
it's hard to get out of it.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you're finished
the day watching television.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
You've lost all the
opportunity you otherwise had

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:90%
to have fun with real people.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it can be a tool
for creating community.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it's
the basis of community.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very hard
for us as human beings

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:90%
to stop with social media.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we do better
when we kind of at least

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:23.030 align:middle line:84%
see facial contact,
facial recognition,

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:90%
even if it is on a screen.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Making eye contact with somebody
and seeing facial expression,

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
seeing gestures is a
very important part

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:84%
of our experience of community
and our experience of humanity.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
challenges with social media

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:84%
has been we can talk to the
people who agree with us too

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:46.490 align:middle line:84%
much, that we can isolate
ourselves into a community

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:84%
where we're all talking
about the same thing

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and agreeing with each other
rather than maybe having

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.490 align:middle line:84%
differences of opinion and
learning from those differences

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and becoming more
mature and adult

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
through those interactions
and differences.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one of
the things I worry about

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.770 align:middle line:84%
with social media and
the isolation it creates

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:12.980 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going to become
less adult, less informed, less

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.973 align:middle line:90%
human because of that lack of--

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.015 align:middle line:90%
that lack of interaction.

00:36:17.015 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Watching some of the
conversations that within two

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:10%
or three comments from something
really interesting to something

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:10%
disrespectful and it doesn't
seem to weigh away within

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:10%
the culture yet to
keep it positive,

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.360 align:middle line:10%
to keep the discussions
going in a way that enhances

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:10%
people's connections
rather than destroys them.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So I am a big proponent
of people actually being able

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:46.040 align:middle line:84%
to look each other in the eye in
a social situation on a street

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:84%
because I do think there is
something profound about that

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:84%
eye contact that helps you
understand and empathize with

00:36:54.320 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:84%
another human being that maybe
is lost even with social media

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:90%
with a screen experience.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the past 15 years, I've
studied technologies of mobile

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.020 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed hundreds
and hundreds of people,

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.610 align:middle line:84%
young and old, about
their plugged-in lives.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:10%
And what I've found is
that our little devices,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:10%
those little devices
in our pockets,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:10%
are so psychologically
powerful that they don't only

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.120 align:middle line:10%
change what we do.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.848 align:middle line:90%
They change who we are.

00:37:32.848 --> 00:37:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Technology has kind of
stripped away everything that

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.183 align:middle line:84%
we would think of as far as
having day-to-day community.

00:37:38.183 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:84%
There's not going to be any
more coming to the coffee shop

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.110 align:middle line:90%
and just sit.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:84%
If you walk into a
coffee shop right now,

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.930 align:middle line:84%
there's small groups of people
sitting close to each other,

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.180 align:middle line:84%
looking at their phones,
and everyone else just

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.680 align:middle line:84%
has their computer
in front of them.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Becoming immersed in
our own echo chambers,

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:55.600 align:middle line:84%
our own curated online world
can lead to real-life community

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:90%
breakdown.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.200 align:middle line:84%
We rarely interact
online with those

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:84%
who are different
from us, and this

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
can contribute to
social ignorance

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:90%
and foster mistrust in others.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Trust is an essential
component of happiness.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:10%
Research tells us
that the more we

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:10%
feel we can trust those around
us, ranging from our neighbors

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:10%
to complete strangers, the
more life satisfaction we have.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Intrigued by this question
of how much we trust those

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
around us, researcher
John Helliwell

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:84%
often includes this question
in his happiness surveys.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.930 align:middle line:84%
If you dropped your
wallet, how likely

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:middle line:84%
is it that it would
be returned to you?

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost nil.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd say 50/50.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:84%
It could go either way
depending on who will find it.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't think so.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.225 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY]

00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Neighborhood dependent.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Highly unlikely.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Highly unlikely?

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Like 20%.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.933 align:middle line:90%
>> 5%.

00:38:52.933 --> 00:38:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You wouldn't get it back.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, not likely.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.723 align:middle line:84%
I want to expect the
best from people.

00:38:59.723 --> 00:39:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important as well

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.352 align:middle line:90%
to have that state of mind.

00:39:04.352 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes a
community, basically.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the spirit,
but I'm not sure

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:09.780 align:middle line:90%
if-- it depends on the person.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.900 align:middle line:10%
>> It's someone in an experiment
to gauge the level of honesty

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.980 align:middle line:10%
and trust in a big city in
2009, the "Toronto Star"

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:10%
dropped 20 wallets around the
greater Toronto area and waited

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:10%
to see how many
would be returned.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:10%
Each wallet contained $43.77,
a photo ID, a phone number,

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:10%
some pictures, and a grocery
list, amongst other things.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:36.020 align:middle line:90%
The results were fascinating.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So 23% thought it
would be returned.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.960 align:middle line:84%
80% of the wallets
were returned.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So I often say we're just
shooting ourselves in our foot

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:84%
by thinking as ill of our
fellow men and woman as we do.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And one reason is that
what you read in the media,

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:84%
in fact, is about this
is supposed to be,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
in fact, what they still
teach in journalism schools is

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:07.940 align:middle line:90%
that bad news sells.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So bad news is when
bad people do something

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:84%
bad to other
people, and then you

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:84%
begin to think it's
much more common than it

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.008 align:middle line:84%
is because that's all
the newspapers are about.

00:40:17.008 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't read about the
good turns people do.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So you underestimate
the ability of other,

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's terribly destructive
of social relations,

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
terribly destructive
of happiness,

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.850 align:middle line:90%
got to be turned around.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear is our most
basic human emotion.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And so to appeal to
fear is obviously

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.530 align:middle line:90%
a very effective strategy.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have sort of
a natural inclination

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:52.160 align:middle line:84%
to also group and to distinguish
whether someone's in my group

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.300 align:middle line:90%
or not in my group.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when we use fear to
sort of promote that tendency,

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.170 align:middle line:90%
that can be quite problematic.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So you're excited.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.260 align:middle line:84%
How do you think
your neighbors are

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.330 align:middle line:84%
going to feel coming
together and interacting

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.530 align:middle line:90%
with each other?

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's going to be
a really valuable experience

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.160 align:middle line:90%
for everyone.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
the level of knowing

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.160 align:middle line:84%
people have of each
other in the building,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
so it'll be a good
experiment for me

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.780 align:middle line:90%
to see how everyone interacts.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.190 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, I'm excited.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:25.970 align:middle line:90%
What do you say?

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.737 align:middle line:84%
Let's just backtrack to
the individual person.

00:41:28.737 --> 00:41:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, right
now, there's somebody

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
who's feeling less
community oriented,

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:84%
feeling socially
isolated, feeling

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.420 align:middle line:84%
like their social
networks have dwindled.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.798 align:middle line:84%
What do you tell
that person to do?

00:41:42.798 --> 00:41:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's mostly to
try to get a sense of how

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.660 align:middle line:90%
they're spending their time now.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Are they in the
right neighborhood?

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it a place that that's
where they can find enough time

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.490 align:middle line:90%
to reach out to others?

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
institutions where

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.340 align:middle line:84%
they may be able to meet
others or serve others?

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:09.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I think sport is this
absolutely incredibly important

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:10%
element of our society.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And I think we can't--

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I can't overemphasize the
importance of the recreation

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.290 align:middle line:84%
department in a city
and their ability

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.180 align:middle line:84%
to get people to get out
there and play together.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful way to
build a sense of community.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.173 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful way
to keep people healthy.

00:42:27.173 --> 00:42:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of folks who work in
sort of the social development

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.630 align:middle line:84%
field would suggest that you
want to limit screen time.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:84%
You want to limit the
use of electronic devices

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that there
is family time that

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.660 align:middle line:84%
allows for actual
social interaction,

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:44.905 align:middle line:90%
face-to-face interaction.

00:42:44.905 --> 00:42:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it means that I'm going
to go back and join a faith

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.197 align:middle line:90%
community like I had as a kid.

00:42:51.197 --> 00:42:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely going
to mean that I'm

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:84%
going to get to
know my neighbors

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and hang out with
them because I want

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:84%
it to be a safe
neighborhood, first of all.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:90%
But I want them to get to know.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And my extended family, we're
going to that Thanksgiving.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.410 align:middle line:90%
We're going to that Christmas.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We're celebrating
everybody's birthdays.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just because it's--

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:84%
we're creating that
with extended friends

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:17.350 align:middle line:84%
because my kids are going
to be way better off.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Sadly but true, all the
negativity that's going out,

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.870 align:middle line:84%
it's bringing factions together
on both sides or whatever.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But people who have different
what they now call--

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.150 align:middle line:84%
cutely call intersectionality
or whatever.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, well,
I'm broke and Black,

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:90%
but you're broke and gay.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And you're rich, but
you're gay and Black.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And like there's some
shit here that all of us

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:40.330 align:middle line:84%
are having to come together
to some extent and kind of--

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I won't say battle but continue
with or at least address

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.360 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more than just going
off to meet your friends

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.340 align:middle line:90%
in the pub.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It is are you
engaged with others

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.980 align:middle line:84%
in trying to make your
community a better place?

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Volunteer work, that is
something that can be a family

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
vitally important

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:84%
that parents and
families are models

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:06.710 align:middle line:84%
of how to be a good
citizen in the world.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been talking to so many
not-for-profit organizations

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and saying, look,
altruism is one thing.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Collective altruism
is a whole nother.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And collective
altruism is when you

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:84%
see a group of people who
are now acting together

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.815 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of something better.

00:44:24.815 --> 00:44:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, absolutely.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.898 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they're bringing
their collective together.

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And now, when they open
themselves to the other--

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.120 align:middle line:84%
so they open themselves
to the other,

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.700 align:middle line:84%
but they're opening
themselves to each other.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>> When we give three hours or
a day to somewhere that needs

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:44.320 align:middle line:10%
help, be it a food shelter,
be it picking up garbage,

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.877 align:middle line:10%
a shoreline, planting
trees, helping with garbage,

00:44:46.877 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:10%
just anything that's needed
around the community that we

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.090 align:middle line:10%
come out and donate our
time, NSAP says, you guys,

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:55.217 align:middle line:10%
go away for three hours, still
getting paid to go help with

00:44:55.217 --> 00:44:56.800 align:middle line:10%
the community and
say, we can do this.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we have about 80
people on the beach right now,

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.963 align:middle line:84%
the shoreline, cleaning up
Jericho and Spanish banks just

00:45:01.963 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:84%
to give back to the
community that we live in.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.040 align:middle line:84%
You ever heard of
Habitat for Humanity?

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I nickname it the Habitat
for Humanity effect.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You've never had a Habitat
volunteer kind of leave a build

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.200 align:middle line:90%
saying, oh, my god.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.220 align:middle line:90%
That was so much work.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.210 align:middle line:90%
I just hated it.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:84%
They're all smiling, the ones I
interview, and they're leaving.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, I
got way more out of this

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.350 align:middle line:90%
than I ever put into it.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I would be remiss to say
that we only have a prosocial

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:27.040 align:middle line:90%
instinct.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we as humans also
have a selfish instinct.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.783 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the beautiful
features about human behavior

00:45:31.783 --> 00:45:33.940 align:middle line:84%
is that we feel good
when we give probably

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's been advantageous
for us to get along

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> They underestimate the
happiness they'll get from

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:45.560 align:middle line:84%
doing something with good
purpose with others for others.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.920 align:middle line:84%
The best purpose
is one that either

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:53.230 align:middle line:84%
will make a better environment
for future generations

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:84%
or make life better for people
you're dealing with right now.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be cleaning
up this beach

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:01.720 align:middle line:84%
or cleaning up
this neighborhood.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe what can we
do to actually help

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.230 align:middle line:84%
some disadvantaged
community to get

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:84%
a greater purchase on the
future by us getting involved

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:90%
directly?

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies show that when we
live in a place surrounded

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.930 align:middle line:84%
by greenery, our neighbors tend
to be more generous, trusting,

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.620 align:middle line:84%
sociable, and most importantly,
have a greater sense

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.580 align:middle line:84%
of belonging and a heightened
willingness to help others.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
opposite is also true.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.090 align:middle line:84%
In environments
that lack greenery,

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.960 align:middle line:84%
we find higher rates of
aggression, violence, crime,

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.190 align:middle line:84%
a lack of social support,
and increased loneliness,

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
elements that greatly affect
our sense of belonging

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:58.080 align:middle line:90%
and therefore our well-being.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I live in South Central.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.490 align:middle line:10%
This is South Central--

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:10.493 align:middle line:10%
liquor stores, fast
food, vacant lots.

00:47:10.493 --> 00:47:12.160 align:middle line:10%
So the city planners,
they get together,

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.780 align:middle line:10%
and they figure they're going
to change the name South

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.800 align:middle line:10%
Central to make it
represent something else.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So they change it to
South Los Angeles.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.140 align:middle line:10%
Like this is going to fix what's
really going wrong in the city.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.740 align:middle line:10%
This is South Los Angeles--

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:33.050 align:middle line:10%
liquor store, fast
food, vacant lots.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine if you see
ugly all day long.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Every day, all you see is ugly.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:44.330 align:middle line:84%
All you see is despair, and you
don't even know it's despair

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.220 align:middle line:90%
because that's your normal.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine you wake
up in the morning,

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and you pull your curtain back.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And you get to see
this beautiful vista

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:59.360 align:middle line:84%
with green meadows and beautiful
flowers and hummingbirds

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.440 align:middle line:84%
at your window and
butterflies in your bedroom

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.232 align:middle line:84%
and this beautiful art
hanging around you.

00:48:05.232 --> 00:48:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And everywhere you go is art.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.730 align:middle line:90%
And you walk down the street.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's line is lush
and green and plants.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.808 align:middle line:84%
And everything around
you is beautiful.

00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how you think
that's going to affect you.

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.110 align:middle line:90%
It's going to change it.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Finley is a
community activist,

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.170 align:middle line:84%
also known as the
Gangster Gardener.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.510 align:middle line:84%
He spent the last
decade teaching people

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.880 align:middle line:84%
about the power of
community gardens

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and encouraging the people
of South Los Angeles

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to grow their own food,
not only to provide access

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:42.140 align:middle line:84%
to local healthy food but also
to beautify their surroundings

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and build a sense of community.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing with this garden is
gardening period is it's common

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.460 align:middle line:90%
ground.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.855 align:middle line:90%
They bring people together.

00:48:50.855 --> 00:48:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I wanted to do.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.910 align:middle line:90%
That was one of my intents.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get people of
different cultures in a garden

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.310 align:middle line:84%
together because these
people grow this red thing,

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and these people grow
these purple things

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:90%
that we've never seen.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.460 align:middle line:90%
And these people grow this.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I think if we all
mesh our communities.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.370 align:middle line:90%
We mesh our food.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.080 align:middle line:90%
We mesh our cultures.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.505 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want
to see happen.

00:49:19.505 --> 00:49:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's 5 to 5:00.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's no people here yet,
but I'm still very hopeful.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a two-hour window,
so that gives them some time

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.310 align:middle line:84%
to come up and
hopefully grab a bite

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and some drinks because
we have a good spread.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little nervous
and excited because I

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.390 align:middle line:84%
haven't met a lot of
people in the building.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:49.945 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just hoping that I get
to meet some of them tonight.

00:49:49.945 --> 00:49:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think?

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you're going
to get to meet anyone?

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm still hopeful.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a Sunday.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:56.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not raining.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.253 align:middle line:84%
And what better things
do people have to do?

00:49:58.253 --> 00:49:59.295 align:middle line:90%
It's a party on the roof.

00:49:59.295 --> 00:50:02.198 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.198 --> 00:50:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like someone makes the
effort to try and connect with

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.120 align:middle line:90%
people in their building.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like you just
hope people come.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been shown time and time
again that sharing food builds

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.570 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Professor and
sociologist Alice Julia

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:24.130 align:middle line:84%
argues that those who share food
with a diverse group of people

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.200 align:middle line:84%
tend to view different
races, genders,

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and socioeconomic backgrounds,
as more equal than they would

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.310 align:middle line:90%
in other social scenarios.

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the simple act
of sharing a meal with others

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:40.510 align:middle line:84%
can make you a more open
and accepting person

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and offer an
opportunity to connect

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.260 align:middle line:84%
with a variety of
different people.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I think when I moved to
Vancouver three years ago,

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.550 align:middle line:10%
I felt that it was harder
to find my own community.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:10%
It was hard to know where I can
make those connections where

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.520 align:middle line:10%
I felt like I was
growing my friend circle

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.800 align:middle line:10%
and building long-lasting
relationships,

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.580 align:middle line:10%
and I start to find
that through food.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.197 align:middle line:84%
Food is something
we all do every day.

00:51:06.197 --> 00:51:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's cooking
a meal with somebody

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.550 align:middle line:84%
or learning to grow
food with other people,

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.453 align:middle line:84%
I felt it was a great
way to bridge those gaps

00:51:13.453 --> 00:51:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and make those
connections easier.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:18.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Food is often a way to
communicate with people when

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.890 align:middle line:10%
you can't communicate with
them through language.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:10%
I was telling you earlier
about our neighbors

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.730 align:middle line:10%
down the street, the
Al-Khateeb family, and the mom,

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:33.980 align:middle line:10%
in particular, she
didn't speak any English

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.050 align:middle line:10%
but was a very generous,
hospitable person.

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And so as a way of getting
to know each other,

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:42.930 align:middle line:84%
we would sort of
exchange food gifts.

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think she was so happy
for the welcome she had received

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in this neighborhood that the
best way she knew how to say

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.000 align:middle line:84%
thank you is to
bring over gifts.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And she'd bring over
traditional Arab delicacies.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So we started doing
food exchanges,

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was a way for us
to bond even though we couldn't

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.237 align:middle line:90%
speak very well together.

00:52:07.237 --> 00:52:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> We want to welcome newcomers.

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We want to grapple with
different culture beliefs

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.210 align:middle line:90%
and needs and be welcoming.

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So how do you do that if you
don't involve those people,

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.170 align:middle line:84%
ask them questions,
understand their needs?

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a tendency
for us to be with people who

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.390 align:middle line:90%
are like us.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
a very human thing.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.590 align:middle line:90%
But we live in the 21st century.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.700 align:middle line:90%
We can enjoy other cultures.

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand
what's good about them

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and what learn from
them because we

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.900 align:middle line:84%
live in a highly diverse world,
and shutting yourself off

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.790 align:middle line:84%
from it is actually
to shut yourself off

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.410 align:middle line:90%
from a lot of enrichment.

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it's better not to
cocoon yourself all the time

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:53.270 align:middle line:84%
with the known friends and
comfortable zones you have,

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.070 align:middle line:84%
but to think about reaching out
to others outside the comfort

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:56.870 align:middle line:90%
zone.

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.330 align:middle line:84%
In a way, that's
the central message

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I have really is to go
outside your comfort zone,

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:04.010 align:middle line:84%
even if your comfort
zone is pretty

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.720 align:middle line:90%
well connected and friendly.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, guys.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:09.770 align:middle line:90%
It's 5:30.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:10.760 align:middle line:90%
No one is here.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking I'm going
to go knock on some doors

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and see why people aren't
coming because we have lots

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of good food and
good drinks, and they

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.720 align:middle line:90%
should be enjoying it with us.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, speak of the devil.

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.800 align:middle line:90%
There's someone coming.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.258 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:29.258 --> 00:54:00.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Living alone has made me
reach out a bit more and come

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to events like this on
Sunday and stuff like that.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.223 align:middle line:90%
>> I got this invitation.

00:54:07.223 --> 00:54:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, that's nice
person, an invitation.

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going to grow up
a bit and meet my neighbors.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I mean, it's great.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to come up here
and meet some people,

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.670 align:middle line:84%
see some people
maybe you've seen

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.440 align:middle line:84%
around the condo or
the apartment building

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.800 align:middle line:90%
and get a name to a face.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I really feel good, and I
feel like we should have this

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:25.880 align:middle line:90%
more often.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a really nice idea.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised we didn't have
this before, a good way to meet

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.780 align:middle line:90%
your meet your neighbors.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Arash and I were just saying
that we definitely want to host

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:38.840 align:middle line:90%
another event for the building.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe I don't
know winter, if there

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is a room in there that we
could use or something like that

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:90%
or do something in the summer.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But we definitely said that
we want more events like this.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.190 align:middle line:90%
What do you guys think?

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Definitely summertime.

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> While there are many
things that can keep us apart,

00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we need to focus
on coming together.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Professor
Margaret J. Wheatley sums it

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:84%
up best by saying, when
we seek for connection,

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.780 align:middle line:84%
we restore the
world to wholeness.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Our seemingly
separate lives become

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:14.690 align:middle line:84%
meaningful as we discover
how truly necessary

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:16.250 align:middle line:90%
we are to each other.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I somehow sense that when
you're in right relationship

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to the world around
you that you are well.

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:29.420 align:middle line:84%
That probably means
how you show up

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.320 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your footprint on
this Earth, how you show up

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.290 align:middle line:84%
to your neighbors,
and that ultimately,

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:40.730 align:middle line:90%
that wellness has to do with--

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:46.415 align:middle line:84%
and well being has to do with
almost like a state of being.

00:55:46.415 --> 00:55:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Ask yourself, how am I doing?

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like the
answer to that question,

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.700 align:middle line:84%
then to make a plan to be
more connected to others.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Just beautify
your surroundings,

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:00.080 align:middle line:90%
and that will beautify you.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And that will beautify
everything else,

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.750 align:middle line:90%
people around you.

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So we need to tap
into that energy,

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.360 align:middle line:84%
which means stepping
away from our screens.

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.180 align:middle line:84%
It means stepping outside
of our front door.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's not waste
each other's time.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's not waste our time.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.675 align:middle line:84%
Let's together do something
to improve the community.

00:56:17.675 --> 00:56:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We haven't met
enough of our neighbors,

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and people want to be
more of our neighbors.

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:25.915 align:middle line:84%
So I think that this
is just the beginning

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:28.040 align:middle line:84%
of more and more events
like this for our building.

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We're actually starting
to design for interaction.

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to think about
public space, gathering,

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.330 align:middle line:84%
celebration, and just
random interactions

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that people have and
can just say hello

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.000 align:middle line:90%
to each other on the street.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.270 align:middle line:10%
>> On my journey from the
mountains of Jamaica to cities

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:51.770 align:middle line:10%
across North America, one
thing has become clear.

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Eating well and exercising
are two critical components

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:59.870 align:middle line:84%
of a healthy lifestyle, but
they're not the only ones.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:04.290 align:middle line:84%
In order to achieve true
health, physical, emotional,

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and social, we need
to come together.

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Devoting time, effort, and
energy into your community

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:15.380 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
solid investments

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.810 align:middle line:84%
you can make because
the more you give,

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.720 align:middle line:90%
the more you'll get back.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And what you stand
to gain is priceless.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You've heard Nelson
Mandela say [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I am because of you.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:34.970 align:middle line:84%
My identity exists
because of you.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Through your eyes, you are
the one who shapes who I am.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it basically means that
for him, we are all connected.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.910 align:middle line:90%
