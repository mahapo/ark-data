[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>She was altruistic and
totally ambitious to attract

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:90%
the attention of the world.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>She was a genius.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Nobody before her
had the audacity

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.405 align:middle line:84%
to try to do a global
reinterpretation

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality the
way that she did.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>At a time when
women, like children,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
were expected to be
seen and not heard,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
it was said that she
left her husbands

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:90%
to become a trick in the circus.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Traveling alone, she
entered forbidden Tibet.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
She was a spiritual genius,
and the mother of the new age.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there are those

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:84%
who say she was a fraud,
whose one real talent was

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:84%
she knew how to
tell a good tale.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Magnetic personality.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.050 align:middle line:90%
She was a good storyteller.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>A fascinating
conversationalist

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
who attracted people
everywhere she went.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Given her lifelong concern
with things mystical,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical, and
spiritual, it's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
perhaps surprising
to discover that she

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.645 align:middle line:84%
had an affect on
the world we know

00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:90%
in ways we could hardly imagine.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.972 align:middle line:84%
>>Nobody else could give
what she gave to the world.

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Helena Petrovna
Blavatsky, Madame Blavatsky,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
HPB-- whatever you call
her, she a larger than life

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
woman, a true
spiritual traveler.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Few would contest
her right to be

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
called the mother
of the new age.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Before HPB, every
right-thinking European

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:84%
knew that the
religions of the East

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
were superstitions followed
by gullible members of lesser

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%
races.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Blavatsky would make
it commonplace to see

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Eastern religions,
Hinduism, and Buddhism

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
as important sacred teachings
that some might consider

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
superior to those of
the Christian West.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
East and West live
much closer today

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
than HPB's contemporaries
could've ever dreamed.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that you can
eat a hamburger in Singapore

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:90%
for dim sum in Toronto.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
The roads built by exploitation,
colonization, and commerce

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
became the highways of
intercultural exchange.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's take a moment
first to thank yourself

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:90%
for practicing yoga today.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Few in the Toronto
of the 19th century

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.871 align:middle line:84%
would have never heard of
yoga, let alone practiced it.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.218 align:middle line:84%
>>For taking this
time to connect

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
with yourself and
the world around you.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Today, in almost any
city on the planet,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:84%
you can use between
dozens of flavors

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient physical and
mystical practice of India.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether you prefer it stripped
of religious implications

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
or in a more
traditional form, you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
can buy your specialized yoga
clothes, slippers, pillow,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:84%
or mat, and none of your
friends will even blink an eye.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not just yoga that has
become part of Western life.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It's everything from
crystals to religious icons

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to books on esoteric secrets
of the East and West.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Not that long ago,
these concepts

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:84%
would have seemed
very odd to us indeed.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:10%
>>The most important
thing about Blavatsky

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:10%
is her role in
trying to synthesize

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:10%
a global spirituality that
explains all religions.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:84%
That's something that is almost
standard now among new age

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:84%
gurus of various sorts, but
she was the first person

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
who took on the task
of trying to explain

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:84%
the entire gamut of
human spirituality.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And to embody what
she had learned

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
in the course of studying all
these religious traditions

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual path
that somehow transcended

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and incorporated all of them.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a road,
steep and thorny,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
beset with perils of every
kind, but yet a road,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and it leads to the
heart of the universe.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.612 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you how to find
those who will show you

00:04:25.612 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:84%
the secret gatway that
leads inward only.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:84%
For those who wend
onwards, there

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is reward past all
telling-- the power

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:90%
to bless and save humanity.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
For those who fail,
there are other lives

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
in which success may come.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
This woman who
was ahead of time,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
who had an impact on our
world in far-reaching ways,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
began life as Helena
Petrovna von Hahn.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:10%
>>She was born in what is
today the Ukraine in 1831.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:84%
She came from a fairly
prominent family.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Her father was
a military officer

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.490 align:middle line:84%
who was frequently
away from home,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes took the family
with him to far-flung spots

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
in the expanding Russian empire.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Her mother was one of
Russia's most respected writers.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And because she
wrote about women

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and what miserable
lives they had,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
she was known as the
Russian George Sand.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>She showed some
tendency towards what

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:84%
we would call psychic
phenomena, and was a rather

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
impetuous child-- very
independent minded.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:10%
>>She was beginning
in childhood,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:10%
but more in adolescence,
also exposed

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:10%
to Russian occultism in
the form of free masonry

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.190 align:middle line:10%
is Rosicrucianism, because
her great-grandfather had

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:10%
a vast library that, in
her later recollection,

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:10%
she said she had
devoured every book in.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:10%
>>It could be that this is where
she got much of her knowledge

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:10%
that she was famous
for in later life.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:10%
>>So Blavatsky had a taste
for the exotic from very

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:10%
early childhood because
of the cosmopolitan

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:10%
circumstances of her family.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:10%
>>As a child, Helena
displayed unusual behavior.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:10%
She had disturbing visions,
spoke to invisible playmates,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:10%
and told stories of
exotic adventures

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:10%
where she was the heroine.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:10%
These stories were so
vivid that her sister

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:10%
was sure she must've really
had these experiences, perhaps

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:10%
in a previous incarnation.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Her family was often
concerned about her future.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:10%
>>About age 17,
so the story goes,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:10%
she was taunted by
an English governess

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:10%
that nobody would
be interested in her

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:10%
because she was
temperamental, she

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:10%
was difficult to get along
with, she was extremely willful.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, even
old Blavatsky over here,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
the plumeless raven,
would never be interested.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:84%
He was a man, so far
as we understand,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
was about 39 years
old at the time.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:90%
So he was over twice her age.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she took the
dar, or however it was,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and the proposal came,
and they were married.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
But she was not interested
in being anybody's wife.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And it only lasted
a couple of months,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and off she went, beginning 20
years, really, of world travel.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:84%
The question of who,
what, where is God,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and what was the
immortal spirit of man?

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
This was a question that
had always troubled her.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>So whether it was a romantic
infatuation or a spiritual one,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
she had begun to
conceive of herself

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
as wanting to travel in
pursuit of spiritual mysteries

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.717 align:middle line:90%
and truth.

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>She would have
been one of the very,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:84%
very few women who
travelled alone.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Her behavior was
totally outside the norm,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
outside boundaries
for a woman in that,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:84%
unless the person happened
to be a queen or someone who

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
was in an inherited
position of authority.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:10%
>>There's not much said
about what she was doing,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:10%
except that she apparently
went to those locations

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:10%
where the esoteric or occult
knowledge was prominent.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.965 align:middle line:84%
>>She traveled to
India, the Far East.

00:08:40.965 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
She traveled to America,
North and South,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
investigating mystic
traditions the world around.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.285 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.285 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Deeply interested in
the beliefs and cultures

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
of the world, HPB's
journeys were extensive.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
In trying to piece together
the events of her life,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:84%
more often than not, we
encounter conflicting stories.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Her own accounts
are sometimes vastly

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:90%
different than those of others.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:10%
>>One of the stories
she told about herself

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:10%
was that she had been
a soldier, and she

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:10%
had been a soldier in the
army of Giuseppe Garibaldi who

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:10%
was fighting in those years
trying to unify Italy.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
In this Battle of Mentana,
which was 1867, Garibaldi lost.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Now Madame Blavatsky said that
she had been severely wounded

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
in the battle, and she
had been left for dead

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:90%
on the battlefield.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
She loved to tell this story,
and it was very dramatic.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, she'd even
show scars and everything.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Her next phase was
wondering mostly

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
in Eastern Europe in the
company of a man named

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Agardi Metrovich, who was
a Hungarian opera singer,

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and also a political radical
who involved her in the struggle

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
against the Catholic
domination of Italy.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>He got a job with a touring
company, or a job in Cairo,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
probably with the
Cairo opera house.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:90%
They got on a ship.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:90%
There were 400 passengers on it.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And it had a cargo
in part of gunpowder.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And the ship blew up
off the coast of Greece.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.052 align:middle line:90%
Agardi went down with the ship.

00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people went
down with the shift.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Blavatsky survived.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So there she was, at
the age of about 40.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have
any support again.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
She went on to
Cairo, and she tried

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
to establish a life
for herself there.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And how she supported
yourself was giving seances.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
She connected with
the community there

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that were into
paranormal phenomenon.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:90%
She tried to be a medium.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Although very interested
in spiritualism,

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.208 align:middle line:84%
HPB's understanding
of the phenomena

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.166 align:middle line:84%
was somewhat different
than her fellow mediums.

00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:22.435 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:26.683 align:middle line:84%
But she did explore
this world, and produced

00:11:26.683 --> 00:11:27.516 align:middle line:90%
many manifestations.

00:11:27.516 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>She could slow time down.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Some other examples where
she could make things

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:90%
appear or disappear.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, all of these were
demonstrated by her.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Whether these were
tricks or not,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
many would probably
say they were.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:59.045 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1873, Madame Blavatsky
continued her spiritual journey

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and set sail for
the United States.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>She joined the hundreds
of thousands of people

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
at that time in the 1870s
who were going to America.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:90%
America was the place to go.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:10%
At that time, spiritualism
was a very exciting subject

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.930 align:middle line:10%
to Americans.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:10%
People were open to the
ideas of the paranormal.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
People with psychic
ability who were

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
touring on the
vaudeville circuit.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
People lined up to see
their performances,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.856 align:middle line:90%
to attend their seances.

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think she
probably thought,

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.215 align:middle line:84%
this would be some place where
they might find me interesting.

00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:43.145 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Upon her arrival in
New York, Blavatsky

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:90%
was virtually penniless.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:10%
She had occasional
income from the family,

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:10%
but she had to work.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:10%
She worked making artificial
flowers in a factory.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>She was looking
for a way that she

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:84%
could continue to survive
when she read in the paper

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
stories written by a
man named Henry Olcott.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Henry Steel Olcott
was a respected member

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:90%
of New York society.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:10%
He had worked for the
"New York Tribune,"

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:10%
was a special
investigator on corruption

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:10%
during the Civil War, and was
one of a three-member panel

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:10%
appointed to investigate the
assassination of President

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:10%
Lincoln.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
He was also a lawyer with a
prosperous business in New York

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
With a lingering interest in
spiritualism from his youth,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Olcott decided to investigate
some intriguing spirit

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
manifestations
that were occurring

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:90%
at a farmhouse in Vermont.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Convinced of the
validity of the spirits,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
he wrote an account
of his observations

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:90%
for the New York papers.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.299 align:middle line:84%
He then headed back
to the farmhouse

00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to investigate the
phenomena further.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>It was a farm run by two
brothers named Eddy-- the Eddy

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:90%
brothers, who were mediums.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were giving
these seances.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
People from New York or
wherever would come up.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
They would stay there.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:90%
They had room and board.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening, they
could attend the performances.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Their home became a gathering
place for spiritualists

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:90%
to witness physical phenomena.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So entities would appear
and walk around the room,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and be touched by the
persons in attendance.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The heyday of
spiritualism involved

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
physical manifestations,
and the Eddy brothers

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.793 align:middle line:84%
were famous for
providing a plethora

00:14:43.793 --> 00:14:47.305 align:middle line:84%
of unusual and
fascinating appearances.

00:14:47.305 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Madame Blavatsky was
intrigued both by a desire

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
to continue her investigation
into spiritualist phenomena,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.442 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps to meet the author
of these interesting articles.

00:15:02.442 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>She was driven by
the desire for fame

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.545 align:middle line:84%
constantly, even when it
was not in her interest

00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:10.766 align:middle line:84%
to thrust herself
into the headlines.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.685 align:middle line:84%
>>So she was at this
Eddy Brother's farm.

00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>According to Olcott, HPB
certainly stood out in a crowd.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
"My eye was first attracted by
a scarlet, Garibaldian shirt

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:84%
she wore, as in vivid contrast
with the dull colors around.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Her hair was a thick
blond mop worn shorter

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
than the shoulders, and it
stood out from her head,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
silken soft and
crinkled to the roots.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I whispered to my
companion, good gracious,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
look at that
specimen, will you?"

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Olcott recalled that Madame
Blavatsky went outside

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:90%
and rolled herself a cigarette.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.271 align:middle line:84%
He walked over to her and
said, [SPEAKING FRENCH],

00:15:58.271 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:90%
and offered her a light.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.832 align:middle line:84%
Later, he said that their
acquaintance began in smoke,

00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
but it stirred up a
great and permanent fire.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>He thought she
was fascinating.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
She told him all stories about
being wounded with Garibaldi,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and she had on kind
of beatnik clothes.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't unattractive.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
She was not as obese as
she became later in life,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:84%
but she was a nice
looking, middle aged

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.674 align:middle line:84%
woman who was
dressed peculiarly.

00:16:32.674 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
He thought she was the most
fascinating person he had ever

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:90%
met.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Not only was all Olcott's
first meeting with Blavatsky

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
memorable, but
the manifestations

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
they experienced
together at the Eddy Farm

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
convinced him of how
extraordinary she us.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
According to HPB, the
spirits they encountered

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
during their seances
were numerous,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:90%
and many were familiar to her.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.995 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
"There was a
Georgian boy dressed

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
in a historical
Caucasian attire.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
I recognized and
questioned in Georgian

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
upon circumstances
known only to myself.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:90%
I was understood and answered."

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:90%
"A little old man appears.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:84%
He's dressed as Persian
merchants generally are.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:84%
His dress is perfect
as a national costume.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
He speaks his name
in a loud whisper.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It is an old man
whom I and my family

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:84%
have known for 20
years at Tiflis.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
He says, half in Georgia
man half in Persian,

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that he has got a big
secret to tell me,

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and comes at three different
times vainly seeking

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:90%
to finish his sentence."

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
"A man of gigantic
stature emerges forth,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
dressed in the
picturesque attire

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:90%
of the warriors of Kurdistan.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:84%
He does not speak, but bows
in the oriental fashion,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and lifts up his
spear ornamented

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:84%
with bright-colored
feathers, shaking

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:90%
it-- a token of welcome.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
An old woman appears
with Russian headgear.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
She comes out and
addresses me in Russian,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
calling me by an endearing term
that she used in my childhood.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I recognize an old servant of my
family, a nurse of my sister."

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Their friendship solidified, and
the two returned to New York.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:10%
Shortly after
their arrival, they

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:10%
moved in together--
not as a couple,

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:10%
but more as kindred spirits.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:10%
>>That was very unusual.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:10%
There was no sexual contact
with them as far as is known.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
They were like comrades,
or brother and sister,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:90%
or professional colleagues.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they liked
each other enormously.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:90%
They got on.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And there was a great affection.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>She only became
a spiritual teacher

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
after she made the crucial
connection with Henry Steel

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Olcott, who at the time was
a prominent spiritualist,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and who became her entre
into the world New York

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:90%
spiritualism.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
She begins to write
letters to the editor,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
either defending spiritualists
or attacking their critics,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
making a name for herself in the
spiritualist press where Olcott

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:90%
is already fairly well known.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
"I am here in this
country sent by my lodge

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of truth and
modern spiritualism,

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and it is my most
sacred duty to unveil

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
what it is and expose
what it is not.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps did I arrive
here 100 years too soon?

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, and I'm afraid
it is so, for people

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
seem to care every day less for
truth, and every more for gold.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
My feeble protest and
endeavors will be of no avail.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, I am ever
ready for the grand battle,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and perfectly prepared to
bear any consequences that

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:90%
may fall to my lot."

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a place
that they stayed

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
called the lamasery,
in which Blavatsky

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
had an apartment loaded
with some of her collections

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:90%
from India and elsewhere.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And she would hold
soirees and tell stories.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:10%
And she very quickly
became very well known

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:10%
amongst the elite and
the intellectuals.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Blavatsky starts
to become a book

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:84%
author in our her
own right, slowly

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.563 align:middle line:84%
beginning to work on what
become "Isis Unveiled."

00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>This was HPB's
first major work,

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and offers her insights on
both Eastern and Western

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:90%
religion and philosophy.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Olcott was her collaborator
in the writing process, which

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
involved many strange
phenomena, which convinced him

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that she was being assisted
by invisible helpers,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
not only in the spirit world
but living men elsewhere

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
who were communicating
telepathically

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.679 align:middle line:84%
or occupying her body,
and writing through her.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Blavatsky explained that
these invisible helpers

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:84%
were adepts or
masters who were part

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:84%
of a brotherhood of
enlightened spiritual beings.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Olcott talks about hands
appearing mysteriously

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and writing during the
night while she's asleep.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The composition process
of "Isis Unveiled"

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
is only the first instance
where the authorship of items

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that appear under her
name is somewhat confused,

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
because both she and
Olcott say that there were

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
many others helping
behind the scenes.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:10%
>>She started writing,
and she said, well,

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:10%
I get it from my masters.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:10%
They're dictating to me.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:10%
Or I see it in the astral
light, the inner worlds.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I first read
that, I said, oh yeah, right.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself very soon
running back for a glossary

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:84%
because the terminology
was a huge barrier.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what all
this Eastern philosophical

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:90%
terminology meant.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here was a
person who was touching

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
every conceivable
subject of importance

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
in areas of religion and
philosophy and science,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
written with knowledge.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how can a
person know so much about so

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:30.290 align:middle line:84%
many things, and handle
it with skill in this way?

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.403 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't know.

00:22:32.403 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HPB communicated mainly with
two masters-- Morya and Koot

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Hoomi.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>These people lived in Tibet,
but they weren't Tibetans.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:90%
They were Indians.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Brotherhood had picked
her to disseminate their ideas,

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
as much as they want
to reveal to the world,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:90%
through the Madame.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>They feel they can
do more for the world

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
by not being visible
personalities.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And there has been a lot
of interesting developments

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
of that idea where one hears
about descended masters and so

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
They themselves say, no,
no, we're fully physical.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We are what we are by
virtue of our training.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We have spent our
lifetime pursuing

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
spiritual and philosophical
and scientific questions,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and we feel that we have some
answers that we can provide

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that help humanity to
understand what they are,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:84%
where they came
from-- the answers

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
to the questions of
ultimate concern.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>These masters are more
spiritually evolved.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:10%
That means that they can live
longer-- hundreds of years--

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:10%
they have much more
knowledge, they

00:23:52.430 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:10%
are almost-- if you can use
an analogy, almost resembling,

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:10%
we might say, the
hidden hand theory,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:10%
which means that
behind this world,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:10%
there is a small
cadre of individuals

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:10%
who are controlling things.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:10%
And so these masters are in
separate brotherhoods in India,

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:23.790 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt, and elsewhere who
are helping to perhaps control

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:10%
the progress of the planet
and spreading the wisdom.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:10%
>>While living in New York,
many guests visited the lamasery

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:10%
and were entertained and
intrigued by HPB's stories.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.925 align:middle line:84%
They were also touched by
something profoundly important

00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:48.749 align:middle line:90%
in her words.

00:24:48.749 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>The two of them had
many discussions ,

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and they also had many
visitors to their apartment--

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:84%
people who were also
interested in the occult,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
who found that everything
that Madame had to say very

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:10%
And at some point, Olcott
said to this little group,

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't it be useful to
form a club or a society

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:10%
to study the occult
phenomenon further?

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And Madame Blavatsky said,
yes, that's a very good idea.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>The Theosophical Society
was formed in 1875,

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and still exists today with
branches all over the world.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:10%
>>And the original
objective of the society

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:10%
was very simple,
one sentence long--

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:10%
to collect and
diffuse all knowledge

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.156 align:middle line:10%
of the laws of the
universe, period.

00:25:46.156 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Once a student abandoned the
old trodden highway of routine,

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and enters upon the solitary
path of independent thought,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:84%
god-ward, he use a theosophist,
an original thinker,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
a seeker after the eternal truth
with an inspiration of his own

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:90%
to solve the universal problems.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
According to HPB,
theosophy, or divine wisdom,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
refers to the ultimate truth
of the supreme, the cosmos,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and humanity.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It is a truth that has
existed from the dawn of time.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:10%
>>Theosophy some
way a connection

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.680 align:middle line:10%
between the world
and the divine.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And what is in the world
reflects the divine,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.350 align:middle line:90%
and is the divine.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is a
unified teaching

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:10%
in which everything
literally is God.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:10%
>>There has been some
question about how

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:10%
the masters communicated with
HPB from their home in Tibet.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.470 align:middle line:10%
Along with Olcott, many
of Blavatsky's followers

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:10%
claimed to see these
masters as well.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:10%
Some explained this as
examples of astral projection.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>There is quite a bit mentioned
about out of body experiences,

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:90%
or astral projection.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So it could very
well be that this

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
was the true purpose
of the society.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
How do you, in fact, go beyond
your ordinary, imperfect self

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and become perfected?

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
To become an adept,
for instance.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that
if you put this together

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:84%
with the notion
of the masters, it

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:84%
could very well be that
the masters were perceived

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
to be human beings who projected
themselves out of the body.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was the reason why
they can go literally anywhere

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
in the world to communicate
with individuals.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason
why masters were not

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
looked upon with skepticism,
that they did have ability,

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and that they themselves--
theosophists-- expected

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:90%
to have this same ability.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Perhaps this helps to explain
some of the unusual phenomena

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.800 align:middle line:90%
that HPB was said to perform.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:10%
>>Olcott describes
her in some cases

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:10%
is performing phenomena that
are hard to explain now,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:10%
but perhaps only either
genuineness or hypnosis

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:10%
explains her being able
to physically transform

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:10%
her appearance into that
of a man with black hair,

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:10%
and then change
back into herself.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Olcott describes
things like this

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.460 align:middle line:84%
that are just
impossible to interpret,

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:84%
but remain fascinating as
to what was really going on.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>"Isis Unveiled" was
published in 1877,

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and the first edition
sold out within 10 days.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, the
reviews were mixed.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.090 align:middle line:84%
The "New York
Herald" called it one

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
of the most remarkable
productions of the century,

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:84%
while "The Sun" called
it discarded rubbish.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Reviews inside,
HPB was undoubtedly

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
pleased her message was
reaching a wider audience.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the
decision was made

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.335 align:middle line:84%
to spread the message
of theosophy further.

00:29:15.335 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>They remained in
New York until 1978,

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:84%
when the decision was made--
probably on Olcott's advice--

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:30.925 align:middle line:84%
that they-- Blavatsky
and he-- go to India.

00:29:30.925 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Which he considered to be the
land of the sacred wisdom,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.874 align:middle line:84%
where more of the sacred
wisdom could be found

00:29:42.874 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:84%
than any other
place in the world.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
reason why they went.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.480 align:middle line:84%
They were received
with open arms

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:84%
by the native
populace, the Indians,

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
because they were perceived
to be two individuals who

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.030 align:middle line:84%
came to investigate
their religion,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
not to try to convert them to
Christianity, as was the usual.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>The British had
ruled India since 1858.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Even before then, European
commercial interests

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:90%
had been in control.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.160 align:middle line:84%
There was no lack of
Indians who saw themselves

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
through European eyes
as backward heathens.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.455 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.455 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>The natives felt that their
cultures were under assault

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:84%
by the West, and particularly
the missionaries.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And they saw
Blavatsky and Olcott

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
as very welcome
allies in the struggle

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
to revive their own
cultural traditions,

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and shake off the
domination of Christianity.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>This was the beginning
of Olcott's work

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to try to revive Buddhism in
the south and southeast Asia.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:06.078 align:middle line:84%
And for a large degree,
Olcott was successful.

00:31:06.078 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Blavatsky also supposedly gave
Indians a better understanding

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and more respect for
their own culture.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible
to connect some dots

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
between her admiration
for the Indians

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and her respect for them,
and Indian nationalism

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.400 align:middle line:84%
through the first half
of the 20th century,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and the ultimate
independence of India.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.620 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.605 align:middle line:84%
>>They were the first
Westerners to become Buddhists

00:31:37.605 --> 00:31:41.930 align:middle line:90%
in a formal, official ceremony.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.380 align:middle line:84%
There were certain
ways Westerners

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:84%
who became admirers of
Buddhism before that,

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:84%
but never this kind
of formal affiliation.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.460 align:middle line:10%
>>Once they became
established, eventually they

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:02.700 align:middle line:10%
headed over to Madras,
and they bought

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:10%
some property called
Huddleston Gardens.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And that became the
future headquarters

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Theosophical Society.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It was around this
time that they

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%
met AP Sinnett, was to become
a very important figure later

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:90%
on in this society.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Sinnett was the editor
of the "Pioneer,"

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:34.386 align:middle line:84%
and he publicized the coming
of the two theosophists.

00:32:34.386 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And he had, after
meeting Blavatsky,

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
some questions about
theosophy, what

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:84%
the teaching was all
about, and apparently was

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:84%
contacted by a master
through a letter.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And out of this came
a correspondence

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that lasted from
about 1880 to 1886.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The number of letters-- it was
about 145 that were exchanged.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:84%
All of these letters were
written by Koot Hoomi or Morya.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Sinnett was not
the only one who

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:84%
received letters
from the masters.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:84%
There were those who
believed wholeheartedly

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.240 align:middle line:90%
in their authenticity.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Others had their doubts.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>She did miracles like crazy.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:10%
The letters from Koot Hoomi
giving instructions to her

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:10%
or just giving information,
were flying like crazy.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.180 align:middle line:90%
They landed on people's heads.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:84%
They landed next to
the [? monetable ?].

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The letters sometimes
came through the mail.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Whoever she wished to
influence or wished

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
to convince that she
was who she said she was

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:52.260 align:middle line:84%
came through these letters
which I referred to, not really

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.655 align:middle line:84%
facetiously, but as
the astral post office.

00:33:54.655 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:90%


00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:10%
People were-- a lot of these
people, like Alfred Sinnett,

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:10%
were people who were
almost like Olcott.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.670 align:middle line:10%
They wanted very badly to
believe in what she said.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:13.440 align:middle line:10%
They also don't want to be
made to seem like fools,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:10%
so their job was to keep their
own belief, to support her,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:10%
to prop her up, and try
to convince everyone

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.719 align:middle line:10%
that, yes, she was
right, yes, there

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:26.270 align:middle line:10%
were this brotherhood, because
the idea of the brotherhood

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.650 align:middle line:10%
it's was intriguing.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And in a way, it still is.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea
of a group that's

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.170 align:middle line:84%
looking out for the best
interests of the world, that

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.780 align:middle line:84%
reincarnate when the
world needs them,

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:84%
someone that's keeping
track of things.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.839 align:middle line:90%
It's not just all chaos.

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:44.780 align:middle line:90%


00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:10%
>>Now the big question is,
were these letters genuine?

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:10%
Were they actually written by
masters from Tibet or India?

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Or were they for frauds?

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>>The allegations of fraud that
are best known and best founded

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.330 align:middle line:10%
in my conclusion
are those associated

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:10%
with something called
the Shrine Room that

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.570 align:middle line:10%
was in the Adyar headquarters.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And there, there was
a room in the wall

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of which was a wooden cabinet
where letters from the masters

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:90%
would appear.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Miraculously in
that, a person would

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:84%
speak some concern
or question, and then

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.960 align:middle line:84%
a letter answering that
would appear within minutes.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And they would open the door,
and there the letter would be.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:84%
It did not take long
for suspicions to arise.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And when two household
employees-- Alexis and Emma

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Coulomb-- confessed to
a Christian magazine

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that they had assisted Blavatsky
in fraudulent phenomena,

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.090 align:middle line:84%
stuffing these
letters through a hole

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:90%
in the wall behind the shrine.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:84%
This caused an uproar
where the whole business

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of receiving letters
from the masters

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.715 align:middle line:84%
became the center
of the accusations

00:36:08.715 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:90%
against Blavatsky of fraud.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.380 align:middle line:10%
>>When Madame Blavatsky
was accused of fraud,

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:10%
her supporters
responded immediately.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.440 align:middle line:10%
They blamed the Coulombs
for making the story up

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:10%
in retaliation for being fired.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:10%
All of this occurred while
Madame Blavatsky was out

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:10%
of the country.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Whether true or not,
these allegations

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:84%
set in motion potentially
catastrophic events.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:47.070 align:middle line:10%
>>She attracted the attention
of a scientific group,

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.050 align:middle line:10%
the Society for
Psychical Research.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:10%
This was a British group who
was the closest thing there

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.070 align:middle line:10%
was at the time to a
scientific organization that

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.710 align:middle line:10%
was interested in
the paranormal.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:middle line:84%
They were a very
respectable group.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They decided to investigate
the Theosophical Society.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.785 align:middle line:84%
They sent an
investigator to India.

00:37:06.785 --> 00:37:09.310 align:middle line:90%
His name was Hodgson.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And he snooped
around for months.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.860 align:middle line:84%
He talked to everyone
he could find.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.380 align:middle line:10%
>>He made what he felt to be
very careful investigations,

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.090 align:middle line:10%
and he issued a report.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>This was Richard Hodgson
first major investigation

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:84%
of this kind, and
many theosophists

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.870 align:middle line:84%
were concerned about
his lack of experience.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:38.150 align:middle line:84%
After months of what he felt
was careful investigation,

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.810 align:middle line:84%
he concluded that there was no
secret brotherhood of masters,

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and all the correspondence from
the Mahatmas was fraudulent.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:51.030 align:middle line:10%
>>The Hodgson Report
forever condemned

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:55.740 align:middle line:10%
Blavatsky in terms of
general public perception

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:10%
by words that have been repeated
many times ever since that one.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.285 align:middle line:84%
One of the most ingenious
and accomplished impostors

00:38:03.285 --> 00:38:03.785 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:38:03.785 --> 00:38:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Blavatsky and Olcott
both blamed each other

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
for the sensationalism that led
to the investigation, and then

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.730 align:middle line:90%
the negative report.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So while he was telling her
that her sensationalism had 3/4

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:84%
ruined the TS and
another dose would

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.420 align:middle line:84%
kill it deader than
a door nail, she

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.950 align:middle line:84%
was saying that
if Olcott had not

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:84%
made such a cult of the masters,
inflaming people's imagination

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:84%
with tall tales about them, that
the Indian followers and then

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.480 align:middle line:84%
the Westerners would never have
become so crazed with worship

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:84%
of the masters that everything
would have collapsed

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
in this embarrassing
humiliation.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:84%
That is what she was
saying, and her quote

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is, "when you speak of
the imaginary Mahatmas,

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.150 align:middle line:90%
you are right."

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But she's not taking
responsibility herself

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.303 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, yes, the
masters have been blown out

00:39:02.303 --> 00:39:05.910 align:middle line:84%
of all proportion, and
theosophist faith is now

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.130 align:middle line:84%
built on a house of sand,
but it's Olcott's fault

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.210 align:middle line:84%
because he fanned the flames
of the sensationalism,

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:16.160 align:middle line:84%
conveniently forgetting
who caused Olcott to become

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.630 align:middle line:84%
such an enthusiast of the
masters in the first place.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The big turning point
in the relationship

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.110 align:middle line:84%
of Olcott and Blavatsky--
if it could be pinpointed

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to a single event-- was
Richard Hodgson showing Olcott

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:37.470 align:middle line:84%
a letter in which HPB
ridiculed him, and said

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that he was completely
under her sway.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:46.300 align:middle line:84%
She treated his belief in
her as an object of contempt.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, after reading that,
he was completely distraught

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and contemplated suicide.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Olcott begins to question
what he's experienced,

00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and to say that sometimes she
was deliberately misleading,

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.050 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the phenomena
were not genuine.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.655 align:middle line:84%
He however never goes
so far as to clue

00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:10.011 align:middle line:84%
that everything he's
experienced was trickery.

00:40:10.011 --> 00:40:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.570 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the Hodgson
Report was a scandal

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:90%
for the Theosophical Society.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:84%
100 years later, the Society
of Psychical Research

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:84%
formally acknowledged that
the original report was

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:84%
badly flawed, and there was
still many unanswered questions

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.900 align:middle line:84%
concerning the life and
work of Madame Blavatsky.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.545 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.545 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:90%
But the damage was done.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:42.220 align:middle line:84%
In with a heavy heart,
HPB left India for good.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Olcott remained to carry on the
work they had started together.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:84%
With a few stops along
the way, she eventually

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:90%
settled down in London.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.040 align:middle line:84%
"My heart is broken
physically and morally.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.662 align:middle line:90%
For the first, I do not care."

00:40:57.662 --> 00:40:59.120 align:middle line:84%
"Master shall take
care it does not

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.650 align:middle line:90%
burst so long as I am needed.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.230 align:middle line:84%
In the second case,
there is no help.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I was ready to shed the last
drop of life in me, give up

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
every hope for the
last shred of-- I

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:84%
shall not say happiness-- but
rest and comfort in this life

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:84%
of torture of the
cause I serve and

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:90%
for every true theosophist."

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:84%
She again presided
over a lodge in London

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:84%
that was a very hot ticket
to be invited to attend.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was not
simply theosophists

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that came to see her, but
anybody who was interested

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.850 align:middle line:84%
in the subjects
that she discussed,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and in meeting a very
controversial and intriguing

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.084 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:41:44.084 --> 00:41:46.577 align:middle line:84%
>>Then in the last
two years of her life,

00:41:46.577 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
she drew the attention of
a well known British woman

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:90%
named Annie Besant.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Annie Besant was a feminist,
a union organizer, a writer,

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:middle line:84%
a person who was enormously
admired in British society.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Getting the approval of
a woman like Annie Besant

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:12.250 align:middle line:84%
brought her an enormous
number of new converts,

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:16.174 align:middle line:84%
much better press than
she'd ever had before.

00:42:16.174 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Madame Besant left the
Theosophical Society

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:90%
to Annie Besant.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:90%
She turned it over to her.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And with that, she achieved
the ultimate respectability.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Her sincerity increased
over the course of her career,

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.850 align:middle line:90%
so she learns from our mistakes.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And in the last few
years, when she's

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.530 align:middle line:84%
doing most of her
writings, she's

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:44.400 align:middle line:84%
a much more careful
and responsible person

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.560 align:middle line:84%
than she was when she was in
the throes of propagandizing

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
for Theosophical
and the masters,

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and getting herself in
the headlines constantly.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>During this
period of her life,

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:84%
she wrote "The Secret
Doctrine-- The Synthesis

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.360 align:middle line:84%
of Science, Religion,
and Philosophy."

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.900 align:middle line:84%
This is Blavatsky's
masterwork on theosophy,

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
covering cosmic, planetary,
and human evolution, as well

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.235 align:middle line:84%
as science, religion,
and mythology.

00:43:09.235 --> 00:43:12.325 align:middle line:90%


00:43:12.325 --> 00:43:14.420 align:middle line:84%
With much of her
writing over the years,

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.490 align:middle line:84%
questions have been raised
regarding source material.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>She was careless and can
be blamed for plagiarism

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.210 align:middle line:90%
in terms of improper citations.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But she did try
to give citations,

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and was adhering to the
standards of the day

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.340 align:middle line:90%
as best she was able to.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.730 align:middle line:84%
She never deliberately
misrepresents

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
the content of any spiritual
teaching, as best I can tell.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, that means she
wants to be taken seriously

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.820 align:middle line:84%
as somebody participating
in the intellectual debates

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.320 align:middle line:90%
of her time.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.110 align:middle line:90%


00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>I think if her work
had not been completed,

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and she would have continued
on for a while longer.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It was influenza.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.790 align:middle line:84%
She was sitting in her easy
chair with friends around her.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.860 align:middle line:90%
They knew she was dying.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.080 align:middle line:90%
And off she went.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It was that simple.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Age 59.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.435 align:middle line:10%
>>Every big newspaper in the
United States had at least one,

00:44:24.435 --> 00:44:27.415 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes two,
articles about her death,

00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:29.090 align:middle line:10%
and they were always
on the front page,

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.440 align:middle line:10%
because she, by this time,
was a world celebrity.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Some people didn't know what
she was a celebrity for,

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:84%
but they knew she was
famous for being famous.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Helena Petrovna Blavatsky--
controversial, extraordinary,

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
larger than life,
harbinger of the new age.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Whether a fraud or a
messenger of secret wisdom,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:84%
she has touched our world
and our lives forever.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>There are some who
would just flatly reject

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:02.640 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there wasn't any
kind of trickery or dishonesty.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Others who would become angry
that the subject was raised

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.550 align:middle line:84%
but still admit
that, yes, there was,

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:84%
but it is outweighed by all the
positive things that she did.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And then others for whom
they have no difficulty

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.430 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging that, and saying,
yes, there's definitely a lot

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.790 align:middle line:84%
to question here, but
to be a theosophist

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:25.840 align:middle line:84%
does not mean to be a follower
of Blavatsky or anyone else.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It means to be a seeker of
divine wisdom, that does not

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.950 align:middle line:84%
require belief in any
claims about anything.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Probably the thing that
she is most well known for,

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and the thing that she
should be known for,

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.550 align:middle line:84%
is a respect for Eastern
culture and Eastern religion--

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:84%
for Hinduism, Buddhism--
and bringing those ideas

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.914 align:middle line:90%
to the West.

00:45:52.914 --> 00:45:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>The very fact
that she did compare

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.120 align:middle line:84%
one religion with another
was, in fact, I think,

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
the beginnings of the
comparative study of religion

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:90%
that we follow today.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>I feel inspired by her vision
of a global spirituality.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.320 align:middle line:84%
All of the Westerners

never, never be stopped.
