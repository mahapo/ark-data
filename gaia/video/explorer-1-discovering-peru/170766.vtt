to discover.

>> There are still
unexplored areas in Peru.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:10%
For example, I found a
reference in a book to a temple.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:10%
I think it was called
[INAUDIBLE,] above Caraz,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:10%
which has two
underground tunnels,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:10%
but nobody knows
exactly where they are,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.589 align:middle line:10%
and nobody has
explored them yet.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And many other tunnels
have been discovered

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:90%
in other parts of Peru.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The same goes for Chavin,
we don't know all about that

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.481 align:middle line:90%
Chavin hasn't been explored.

00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Next we went to see professor
Federico Kauffman Doig,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
one of Peru's leading
archaeologists.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.492 align:middle line:84%
He gave his views on
the underground tunnels.

00:04:56.492 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a book on tunnels,
it was published around 1880,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:10%
all about the traditions.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what's
interesting is that today,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:84%
but even when I was a
child, wherever you go,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:90%
you hear about these tunnels.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:10%
I think it ought to be looked
into, not just at Cusco

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.670 align:middle line:10%
because we didn't get
very satisfactory results,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:10%
but around the country in all
those places where people say,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:10%
there's a tunnel here, there's
the entrance to a tunnel.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We ought put all the
information together.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
it's something

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.205 align:middle line:84%
that really should be done to
make the past come alive again.

information we had,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
we decided to start
our adventure in Cusco.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
The 600-mile trip in the jeeps
from Lima to Cusco isn't easy.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.202 align:middle line:84%
The road runs through
a desert, almost

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:90%
like the surface of the moon.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
We feel a bit
alienated, even more so

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.082 align:middle line:84%
because the plateaus are really
high, and the lack of oxygen

00:06:20.082 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:90%
makes everything more tiring.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Tiny clumps of houses break the
monotony every now and again.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.897 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally, we see
the friendly face of a lama,

00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:90%
or something very like it.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.895 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally,

00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
thumb a lift, ephemeral visions
which appear out of nowhere.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.050 align:middle line:84%
On account of various problems,
and even some landslides

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
which had blocked the
way, we end up in Cusco

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
after 27 hours on the
road, absolutely exhausted

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.609 align:middle line:90%
by the effort and the altitude.

00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Cusco is 11,200
feet above sea level

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:90%
and has a population of 300,000.

The ancient Inca empire
was called Tawantinsuyu.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Cusco was its capital.

from a construction
point-of-view,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
so surprisingly
sophisticated that they

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
would represent a challenge
even to modern builders.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%

is really astonishing.

chiseled and fitted
one on top of

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
the other without any mortar,
apparently haphazardly,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
shaped as if they'd been
made of soft plastic clay.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
How were these massive stones
transported and set in place?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:84%
How could the people of
this ancient civilization

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
fit them together so
perfectly without the help

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:90%
of modern technology?

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
The Incas hadn't
discovered the wheel,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
but their building
techniques bear witness

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
to an amazing knowledge of
engineering and architecture.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
This stone has 12 corners
and fits perfectly

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
into the ones around it.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't get a knife
blade between them,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:90%
but no mortar has been used.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It weighs hundreds
of pounds, but it

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:90%
isn't one of the largest.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
On the other side
of the building,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
the stones form a
pattern representing

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:90%
the outline of a puma.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.736 align:middle line:90%
Amazingly clever craftsmanship.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a stone with
14 corners on the wall

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:90%
of a nearby building.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It's smaller than the
other, but the craftsmanship

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.996 align:middle line:84%
and its polygonal shaping
is still wonderful.

00:09:14.996 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are still
plenty of surprises

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.748 align:middle line:90%

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
it seems as if they were

How did the Indios manage
to quarry the stones

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and transport them, work
them, and then build walls

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
with such precision?

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They had no iron nor steel
to perforate the rock with

smooth the blocks.

oxen to transport them.

Puka Pukara means
the red fortress,

so called because of the color

one of the approaches
to Cusco from here.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The building technique is
undoubtedly less sophisticated

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
here than at
Sacsayhuaman at Cusco.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.991 align:middle line:90%
The stones are much smaller.

00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
an attempt has been

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
made to copy the polygonal
pattern we admired before.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But even if the blocks
are much smaller,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the workmanship is
rougher, and the stones

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:90%
don't fit together as well.

Our doubts increase.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:10%
Did the Incas really
build the walls

And we begin to
really wonder, who

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%

at Cusco and Sacsayhuaman?

already old when they arrived.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the Incas settled

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:84%
on preexisting sites, which
they restored and enlarged.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Inca tradition also tells us
about the original builder.

In ancient days after a
terrible cataclysm, which

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%

had incredible skills.

lightning, and his name

means god of storms.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
were very highly developed
physically, psychically,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and spiritually, a
level of development

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:90%
we haven't achieved yet.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Moving large, heavy
objects represented

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:90%
no particular problem for them.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.100 align:middle line:84%
These teachers
instructed the people

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Andes, our
ancestors who built

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:90%
these wonderful constructions.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
We believe that the
Murian civilization

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
which had reached the Andes went
out west, too, towards Asia.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.785 align:middle line:84%
That's why we find the same
knowledge all over the world.

00:19:41.785 --> 00:19:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this the answer?

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Was Mu a lost civilization we
have no memory of, the mother

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:90%
of all known civilizations?

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
According to the wise
people of the Andes,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:84%
this is the key to many
mysteries of the past,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
but we have other
clues to follow up.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Qenko is a few miles to
the east of Sacsayhuaman.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Its name could hardly be more
appropriate, given what we saw.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:90%
It means intersecting channels.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:84%
The huge rock, deeply
eroded around its base,

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
is carved into a very
strange shape at its summit.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It's chiseled,
carved, and molded

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
to create an absurd maze
of seemingly random shapes

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.500 align:middle line:90%
with no apparent meaning.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible, it
almost makes you dizzy.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the meaning of
those short staircases,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
those little platforms, those
channels, those balconies?

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a real puzzle, impossible
to guess the answer.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Did the Incas make it?

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.009 align:middle line:84%
Was it something to do with
their religious functions?

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're told,
but we don't really

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:90%
know what to think.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:84%
This disturbing
rock puzzle could

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
have been carved 500 years
ago, or 5,000, or 50,000.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.045 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen
anything like it.

00:20:52.045 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:90%
It seemed to have no logic.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a large opening at
the base of the massive rock.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:90%
We go in.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Inside is a fairly large
cave with a carved rock.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:90%
It looks like an altar.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Later we're told that
the Incas used it

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:90%
for their religious ceremonies.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.872 align:middle line:84%
This explanation is certainly
in keeping with its appearance,

00:21:18.872 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and that of the other
carved rocks in the cave.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But the incredible
maze outside looks

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
much older, designed and created
by other hands and other minds.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the Incas had
found these strange ruins

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and turned them into a
temple, believing them sacred.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:90%
That's one explanation.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.230 align:middle line:84%
The style and condition of
the stones seem to back it up.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
The walls and monolith outside
look closer to the Inca style--

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:90%
but not quite.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
We know there's another
site a few miles away

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
with similar carved rock.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
We have also found
out about a passage

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:84%
which accesses a
network of seemingly

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.340 align:middle line:90%
endless underground tunnels.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Many people have ventured in to
explore, never to emerge again.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's called the X-Zone.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Here we get a real surprise.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
The rock looks like an exact
copy of the one at Qenko,

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle line:84%
the same patterns carved
in absurd positions.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Stairs that lead to nowhere,
completely off center.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Why put steps in that position?

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Were they for
working on, or what?

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
On one side, we
discover something

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a throne, but
it's facing a wall of rock.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
The rocks at Qenko at the
X-Zone look out of place,

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.690 align:middle line:84%
almost as if they were once
part of the same project which

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:90%
no longer exists.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.612 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.612 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:84%
We search for the entrance
to the underground tunnels

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.089 align:middle line:90%
and get a nasty surprise.

00:22:54.089 --> 00:22:55.630 align:middle line:84%
The local authorities
have blocked it

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:84%
up to stop other people
wandering in and getting lost.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
We feel like getting down to
work with picks and shovels

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and opening it up again, but
we were repressed the urge

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:90%
and decide to be patient.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
The tunnels exist, all we have
to do now is find a way in.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:84%
These enigmatic sites
are very puzzling,

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the discrepancies
are unsettling.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
We meet someone who has
spoken to other wise man.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
According to him, direct
descendants of the survivors

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:90%
of the destruction of Mu.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:10%
They live in very remote areas
in the heart of the Amazon

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:10%
basin, isolated
from white people.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:90%
His name is Ruben Iwaki Ordonez.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:84%
He has Indio blood in
his veins and he tells us

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
an amazing story about the
origins of the rocks at Qenko

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and the X-Zone.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Right here where the
city of Cusco is now,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:10%
in ancient times
there was a lake.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And under this
lake, under its bed,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:84%
there was an underground temple,
about 250 feet underground.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
The wise ones lived down
there, the ancient ones who

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:90%
governed the continent wisely.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And the entrance
to this place was

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
on a hill, the same hill that's
called Sacsayhuaman today.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:90%
That's where the entrance was.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
After 10,000 years, there was
a cataclysm on the planet.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It destroyed the temple, and
the lake above it flooded.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
This cataclysm wasn't an
earthquake, it was much more.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:90%
There were volcanic eruptions--

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:90%
here, too.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Here, where the
temple was, there

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:84%
was a volcanic eruption,
a terrible explosion.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:10%
In Sacsayhuaman, there's an area
where the lava has solidified.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But that explosion produced
fragments of exploding rock,

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:90%
too, burning pieces of rock.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:10%
The force of the explosion
shattered the rooms

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:10%
of the temple, and fragments
were thrown into the air

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:10%
and fell here, there,
and everywhere.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
There's one that
nowadays is called Qenko.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.290 align:middle line:90%
The Incas found it like that.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
They found these
wonderful constructions

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and they used them for
their religious ceremonies.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they realized
how important they were,

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:90%
they knew where they came from.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
There are other fragments as
big as this room in an area

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:90%
near the solidified lava.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
There, you can see
upside-down staircases.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, these fragments
came up from underground

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:84%
when the disaster
happened, and they fell.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:84%
They fell haphazardly,
upside-down.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:31.081 align:middle line:84%
And this shows that they were
part of what was underground.

00:26:31.081 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Once again, ancient
traditions insist

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:84%
on the existence of once great
civilizations which have now

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:84%
disappeared, and Cusco still has
some mysteries in store for us.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:84%
The most sacred and
important temple

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in the whole of the Inca
empire was at Cusco.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
It was dedicated
to their culture,

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and it was called Coricancha,
or the Golden Enclosure.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish built Santo
Domingo Cathedral on its ruins.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient
walls can still be

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
seen, both from inside and
outside the latter day colonial

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:90%
church.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The walls are still imposing
and very cleverly crafted.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
But the stones themselves
are much smaller

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:84%
than any other structures we
have visited, more a building

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that Inca architects
might have designed.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:84%
There are tunnels
under the church.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:84%
A story tells of how some
boys got lost in them in 1920.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:84%
After a whole week,
only one of them

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
re-emerged, injured
and confused.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:84%
He died soon afterwards,
clutching a solid gold

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:90%
cob of corn.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.110 align:middle line:84%
There are no written records
to confirm the story,

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:84%
but the people of Cusco
assure us it's true.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We managed to get permission
to visit the digs made

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:84%
by other researchers
who had been trying

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to unravel the puzzle of
the mysterious tunnels

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and climb down under the church.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:84%
We follow the tunnel for a
while, but it brought up short.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.920 align:middle line:90%
The tunnel is blocked.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Later, we're told that the
excavations were stopped

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
because of the risk of
undermining the foundations

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.050 align:middle line:90%
of the church above.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We wonder whether the
Coricancha tunnels

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:84%
led to a more impressive network
of underground tunnels, perhaps

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:84%
those that connected Cusco,
Sacsayhuaman, and other places

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:90%
even further away.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:84%
But we'll have to wait for
answers to these questions.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.340 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, the tunnels
exist and their existence

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.675 align:middle line:84%
is backed up by
ancient traditions.

00:28:40.675 --> 00:28:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Traditionally, the tunnels
are supposed to have gone from

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:10%
Cusco towards Quito in Ecuador.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And from the south,
they went towards what

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
is today Bolivia, towards
Chile, towards the forest,

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:90%
towards Brazil.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.316 align:middle line:90%
They went everywhere.

00:29:01.316 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, some of them were
blocked up for safety reasons

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:90%
when they were discovered.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays, it's very
difficult to find the entrances.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I know, I'm sure,
that they exist.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I saw some of them with my
father when I was a child.

there are tunnels

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.502 align:middle line:90%
under the Catholic churches.

00:29:34.502 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We discover that another
church in Cusco has tunnels,

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:90%
the Church of the Jesuits.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
It was built in 1576 on the
foundations of the Amarucancha

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.175 align:middle line:84%
Church, the royal palace of
the Inca ruler, Huayna Capac.

When the Spanish arrived,
Huayna Capac's two sons,

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Huascar and Atahualpa,
were waging a civil war

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.179 align:middle line:90%
for control of the empire.

00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
This helped the Spanish
conquer the Inca kingdom.

One of the most

the altar carved in cedar
wood and covered in gold.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It was by the Italian
sculptor, Bernardo Bitti.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The tunnels are blocked
after only a few meters.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.140 align:middle line:84%
The ecclesiastical
authorities ordered

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.240 align:middle line:84%
them to be blocked
for security reasons.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:84%
The tunnels run under
the city, and in the past

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:84%
have been used by thieves
as a way into the church.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But once more, they confirm
that the Incas' sacred places

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.355 align:middle line:84%
were connected by a
network of tunnels.

Did the Incas build them?

Ancient tradition

The archaeologists say it is.

But on one wall we find a
stretch that has been repaired.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
done by the Incas.

But strangely, the
repair work has

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:05.060 align:middle line:84%
been carried out using
much smaller stones,

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and the level of
craftsmanship is much rougher.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.270 align:middle line:84%

The Incas certainly had no

00:45:07.331 --> 00:45:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Inca empire have
developed such sophisticated

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.720 align:middle line:90%
knowledge?

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.870 align:middle line:84%
These are precise
technical instruments, not

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:90%
simple ritual symbols.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.690 align:middle line:84%
They're backed up by precise,
geometrical calculations,

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.040 align:middle line:90%
mathematics, and astronomy.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Only a civilization
that developed

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.230 align:middle line:84%
over a long period of time
could have produced anything

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:90%
like them.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu means
the old mountain.

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.380 align:middle line:90%
But how old actually is it?

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
According to the
archaeologists, the city

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:90%
was built in the 15th century.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.990 align:middle line:84%
But in 1930,
Professor Rolf Muller

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.320 align:middle line:84%
from the University
of Potsdam in Germany

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.170 align:middle line:84%
studied the astronomic
alignments of the Torreon,

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.980 align:middle line:84%
the Temple with the Three
Windows, and the Intihuatana,

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and established that they
had been built sometime

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.860 align:middle line:90%
between 4,000 and 2000 BC.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.760 align:middle line:84%
These incredible dates were
confirmed by further studies,

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.190 align:middle line:84%
carried out by the
astronomers Dearborn and White

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.990 align:middle line:90%
from Arizona University.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.630 align:middle line:10%
Does this mean that
here, as in other sites,

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.940 align:middle line:10%
the Incas settled on
preexisting structures?

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:84%
The dates calculated
by the astronomers

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.880 align:middle line:90%
confirm this theory.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Local oral traditions
that have been handed down

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to the present day also
tell of ancient gods who

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.830 align:middle line:84%
initiated civilization and
built wonderful cities, gods

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:19.200 align:middle line:84%
who could fly, perhaps the
survivors of the highly

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.870 align:middle line:90%
developed civilization of Mu.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.000 align:middle line:84%
On the sacred square
of Machu Picchu,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.490 align:middle line:84%
the Temple of the Three
Windows, the Main Temple,

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and the other
structures, are all

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.710 align:middle line:84%
built from perfectly fitted
together polygonal blocks.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The by now familiar
joints, already

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.110 align:middle line:90%
seen in Cusco and Sacsayhuaman.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:44.150 align:middle line:84%
We find similar differences
in other parts of the city.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The difference in
style and technique

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:50.660 align:middle line:84%
used to build Machu Picchu
are glaringly obvious.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Carefully crafted monoliths make
up the older part and rougher

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:90%
workmanship on the later parts.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Once more, we find
different styles and levels

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.740 align:middle line:90%
of technical ability.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Were they built by
different people?

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.222 align:middle line:84%
How else can we
explain the difference?

00:47:06.222 --> 00:47:12.130 align:middle line:90%


00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But we have other
mysteries to unravel.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.110 align:middle line:84%
We want to know if there
were any underground tunnels

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:18.659 align:middle line:90%
at Machu Picchu.

00:47:18.659 --> 00:47:20.950 align:middle line:10%
An we're told that when
maintenance work was being done

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.190 align:middle line:10%
on the sacred square,
where the Main Temple is,

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:29.470 align:middle line:10%
the workmen heard echoes as if
the ground below was hollow.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Some digging was done, but
only to a depth of a few feet,

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.580 align:middle line:90%
without finding anything.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the cavities
are further down.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.210 align:middle line:84%
A guide who heard
about our research

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:44.240 align:middle line:84%
said that there was some
tunnels in another area.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.160 align:middle line:90%
He offers to take us there.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:84%
After a difficult scramble, we
come to the narrow entrance.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:59.300 align:middle line:84%
The young guide
climbs down first.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a tight squeeze.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Even passing the equipment,
we need to explore,

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and film is difficult. We
can't really take all we need,

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.485 align:middle line:90%
but we decide to make do.

00:48:15.485 --> 00:48:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Once we're in,
walking isn't easy.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.450 align:middle line:90%
The tunnel is very irregular.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.816 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if it had only
been started and not completed.

00:48:31.816 --> 00:48:37.650 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:40.539 align:middle line:84%
It's very damp, and the ground
underfoot is very slippery,

00:48:40.539 --> 00:48:41.580 align:middle line:90%
so we have to be careful.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:53.710 align:middle line:90%


00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:84%
After a certain distance,
the tunnel is blocked

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:90%
and we can't go any further.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:04.470 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Getting back is
even more difficult,

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.000 align:middle line:84%
but we have the
proof that someone

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.241 align:middle line:84%
had created underground
tunnels at Machu Picchu, too.

00:49:12.241 --> 00:49:18.820 align:middle line:90%


00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.090 align:middle line:84%
The sun is setting as we
emerge from the narrow tunnel.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:84%
The ancient city is
hauntingly beautiful

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and had shared some of
its secrets with us.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are echoing with
the words of Colonel Fawcett,

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.870 align:middle line:84%
"The Indios tribes
inherited the traditions

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.670 align:middle line:90%
of a great civilization.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they were the
ancestors of the Incas,

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.300 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a mysterious race
who left behind the gigantic

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.300 align:middle line:84%
remains that the invading
Incas later incorporated

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.214 align:middle line:90%
into their own buildings."

00:49:48.214 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Historical civilizations all
have a common matrix, albeit a

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.730 align:middle line:90%
forgotten one.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Even Colonel Fawcett was
convinced of the truth of this.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The huge ruins scattered
around Peru and other countries

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.660 align:middle line:84%
around the world
are an obvious clue,

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:84%
confirmed by their identical
construction technique.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.240 align:middle line:84%
The myths and traditions
of many ancient people

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.250 align:middle line:84%
have handed down the memory
of this civilization.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.435 align:middle line:84%
There are mysterious tunnels
at these ancient sites.

00:50:18.435 --> 00:50:21.960 align:middle line:90%


00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps these
clues are still not

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.760 align:middle line:84%
enough to prove the existence
of a lost civilization which

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.410 align:middle line:84%
gave rise to all
successive civilizations.

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.240 align:middle line:84%
There is still a
lot to discover,

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.920 align:middle line:90%
and the research goes on.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:10%
