00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, thank you.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:10%
You know when I first got
the invitation for "Contact

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:10%
in the Desert," I actually
misread the email.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was an invitation
to "Contact in the Dessert."

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Imagine my shock, and
horror, and disappointment.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Never mind, that's how we go.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.268 align:middle line:90%
So, but welcome.

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject
that obviously I've

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:84%
been doing for a very,
very, very, very long time.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book on
it which becomes

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:84%
an international bestseller
called "Secrets in the Fields,"

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
which, incredibly, comes out
the same day as a film called,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:90%
"Signs."

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:90%
totally by accident, we think.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.525 align:middle line:84%
Before you know it,
people connected the dots

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and they realized,
oh, it's not two guys

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
with a piece of board and
some string doing this.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.942 align:middle line:90%
So that's why we're here today.

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back into
some of the information

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that we gathered over the years,
which is still relevant today

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
as it was back then, and it
still continues to be relevant.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Because this phenomena--
unlike many others--

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:90%
has no expiry date.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's still something that's
so relevant to our involvement

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.235 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness down
here on the Earth.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that's one of
the reasons why it's actually

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:10%
happening across the
face of the Earth.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So at the beginning,
what I wanted to do

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
is to bring something into focus
that we tend to forget about.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we tend to
look at the sky for signs

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:90%
of alien contact.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.828 align:middle line:84%
But we often forget to look
really, really close to home.

00:01:42.828 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:90%
We sit outside and look out--

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, sit outside looking
at the Milky Way and wondering,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, is someone coming
down here to help us out?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:10%
And the fact is the help
is actually all around us

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:10%
And when we do actually
look closer to home,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:10%
we wonder why, if the circle
makes us so intelligent,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:10%
why don't they
communicate in something

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:10%
like a global language?

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:10%
Like English, for example.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's the one
thing that I get back again

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:10%
and again and again.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:10%
If they're so advanced, then
why not just make it direct?

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Why make it so difficult?

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.645 align:middle line:10%
Well, think about
it for a second.

>> Call home, Lawrence.

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Well, think about
language for a second.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, words are
very problematic.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean, originally,
in the old, old days,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:10%
words were kind of used to
reflect original truths,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:10%
and ideas, as well.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But people kind of lost
sight of the true meaning

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
of words over the
ages to the point

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
where today language
is kind of used to--

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
well, it's used for convenience,
like, you know, like, you know.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, especially with
the world of texting.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It's also very, very convenient.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And the language, and
the syntax, and the--

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
even the amount of
words that we use today,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.750 align:middle line:84%
they're done just for
convenience for communication.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:90%
That's one problem.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The other problem is that there
are problems in translations.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:10%
Now if you ever tried
sending an email

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:10%
and going through
Google Translate

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:10%
and having it come out
in French, or German,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:10%
or Japanese--

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.190 align:middle line:10%
you ever had that experience?

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:10%
And the lack of-- and the
problems that it causes through

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:10%
lack of direct communication?

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:10%
That's another reason why
they're not communicating

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:10%
in a direct language.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:10%
I remember one
example in Paris when

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:10%
they were having a problem
with water and the drought.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:10%
And there's a famous sign
outside a French restaurant.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:10%
And it said, the
manager has personally

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:10%
passed the water
in this restaurant.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that's
what he meant.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.798 align:middle line:10%
So words, again, they can
be deceiving and deceitful,

00:04:01.798 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:10%
especially when we have to
communicate over each other.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:10%
And we have here a
global phenomenon.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:10%
And yet to have it
being communicated

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:10%
in one specific
language, you can

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:10%
see how the problems multiply.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, on the other hand,
if you use symbol,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:10%
you're actually on a much more
firm platform because a symbol

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:10%
cannot be translated.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:10%
A symbol is a direct
expression of its own function.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:10%
And symbols by their very
nature are mysterious.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:10%
And we, as humans,
are programmed

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:10%
to be attracted
to the mysterious.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's why we're
here at this weekend.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Because the symbols,
when they hide mystery,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:10%
they are concealing something.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.567 align:middle line:10%
And we are fascinated by
what's being concealed.

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:10%
We want to get to the
truth of what's really

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:10%
behind what's being said.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, once you start looking
at what's being concealed,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:10%
that arouses your curiosity.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:10%
And the more curious you
become, the more in depth

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:10%
you go into the subject.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:10%
And once your
curiosity takes over,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:10%
then that leads to inquiry,
and eventually to insights.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:10%
And once you've
achieved an insight

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:10%
through the decoding
of a symbol,

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.855 align:middle line:10%
then you achieve revelation.

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we're
trying to get to.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the crop
circles and the symbols

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:10%
that people have interacted
with over the years,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:10%
it's the same story every--

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:10%
I have reached a level
of self empowerment,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:10%
a sense of revelation.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:10%
I've learned something about
myself or the world I live in.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.295 align:middle line:10%
It comes up again
and again and again.

00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:10%
It seems as though
they're acting

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:10%
on a very intuitive level,
which I'll demonstrate shortly.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:10%
And this is the reason primarily
why symbols have lasted so long

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:10%
for our ancient societies.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:10%
Clifford Mahooty and I usually
have interesting conversations

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:10%
about this, about the symbols
found in the Native American

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:10%
Southwest.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.545 align:middle line:10%
It's a fascinating area.

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm getting clapping
from the other room.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.226 align:middle line:10%
This is--

00:05:47.226 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood music.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Clapping.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I like it here.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.517 align:middle line:90%
I might come back.

00:05:53.517 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Despite the fact that
there's no dessert.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the
symbols lasted so long

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
in ancient cultures because
they represent archetypal ideas

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.955 align:middle line:90%
from culture to culture.

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So even today, when you travel
around the Native American

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Southwest or in the
Aboriginal areas of Australia,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
the symbols are
self-referencing.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Even though we have
different cultures,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
they still are able to
decipher what they mean,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
because they are
ingrained in this culture.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And the funny
thing is, the irony

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
is, that it was
people like the Hopi

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and the Zuni who
originally helped

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
us to understand what the
early crop circles were about.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:10%
And for every single
crop circle that

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:10%
appeared in the early
years of the phenomenon,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:10%
we have a direct correspondence
to an actual petroglyph

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.007 align:middle line:10%
in the Native American Southwest
or in the Australian Outback.

00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And this is what helps us
to understand that we've

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:10%
been given a kind of language.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And because the symbols
are already understood,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:10%
we could then understand
that the early prototypes

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:10%
of the crop circles
were simply telling us,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:10%
this is a message from
a level of reality

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:10%
that you would call gods.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:10%
Not God, not The One, but gods.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:10%
What we also began to call
the archangels and guiding

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:10%
principles through life.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:10%
So whenever we saw two
crop circles created,

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:10%
joined by a line, the
same thing happens

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.393 align:middle line:10%
in Native American expression
in the symbols there,

00:07:16.393 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:10%
because they talked
about how this

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:10%
is used to symbolize that
there's communication

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:10%
from an upward level of reality,
from heaven, communicating

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.462 align:middle line:10%
to a lower level of
reality, called the Earth.

00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it dawned
on those that we were being

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
communicated with by, let's
say for lack of a better word,

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial source.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, if you travel
through the world of the Zuni

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:10%
and the Hopi regions
of Arizona, there

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:10%
are symbolic communications
between the tribes people

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:10%
and the star people.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:10%
And these are usually seen
in some of the petroglyphs

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:10%
around the three Hopi mesas.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
One of them that I'm
particularly keen on

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:90%
is this particular circle.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:90%
This series of circles here.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
This symbol describes
the function

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
of what they call
flying shields.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you read a very good book
called "The Book of the Hopi,"

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:84%
which I totally recommend,
they actually describe how

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:90%
before the flood--

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:90%
about 11,000 years ago--

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.902 align:middle line:84%
the Hopi did connect
with the star people.

00:08:09.902 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And they showed
them that there was

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:84%
a certain type of
technology here

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that was used and
abused in the last days.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:10%
And one of them was some
kind of levitating technology

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:10%
which the Hopi called
flying shields,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:10%
because that's the nearest
expression that they had

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:10%
to look at these flying
disks and the only thing they

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:10%
could relate to was what
they already had with them.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:10%
So this circle and all
of its little appendages,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:10%
and the little
symbols on the side--

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:10%
you can see them right there--

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:10%
they all appear
right here, as well.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:10%
And just in case this is still--

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:10%
this was faked, there's
a local village that--

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:10%
it's about half a mile away.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:10%
It's a small hamlet actually.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:10%
It's not even big enough to
be qualified as a village.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:10%
In the middle of the
night, the local farmer,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:10%
he heard a lot of buzzing
sounds, strange noises.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:10%
A sort of a beam of
light coming down

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the field.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:10%
It's a massive, massive
wheat field by the way.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of the least populated
part of the British Isles.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:10%
And next morning, no
car in the village--

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:10%
sorry, the hamlet.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm elevating a
hamlet to a village.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:10%
All the cars in this
hamlet could not

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:10%
start because all their
batteries were dead.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:10%
That's usually a good
sign that it's a real one.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:10%
If you ever take electric
equipment into a real crop

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:10%
circle, well, you might
as well keep the receipt

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:10%
because you want to send
the camera because it's

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:10%
a very expensive phenomenon.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:10%
It acts on anything
that's electronic.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:10%
So that's one of the
reasons why we knew-- apart

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:10%
from the ground features, which
I'll describe in a second.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:10%
Going back to the reason--

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:10%
in fact, the people
who these are supposed

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:10%
to depict in the Hopi regions,
my good friend Clifford

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:10%
tells me that,
well, these people

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:10%
that we're depicting in the
petroglyphs are called Lookers.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know them because you
have them in England, as well.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
They called the Watchers.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:10%
And these are the people
that also appear around

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:10%
11,000 years ago, just
before a big flood consumes

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:10%
the whole of the Earth.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not talking about
the 200 Watchers that

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:10%
came down, stayed on the
Earth, and did some very, very

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:10%
silly things with genetics.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:10%
We're not talking about those.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
the original group

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.157 align:middle line:10%
of people who are called the
Watchers because they're here

00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:10%
to guide humanity.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:10%
That's essentially what the
Native American cultures

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:10%
describe as being
the fundamental star

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:10%
people that they
communicate with

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:10%
and also the fundamental
consciousness now

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:10%
of who's behind the core
group of the phenomenon.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Now much of the communication
that we see in the crop circle

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
world is actually based
on the universal language

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
of mathematics, and it's
visual expression, geometry,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
especially a very
complex geometry,

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:84%
like Ptolemy's
theorem of chords.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
The gentleman who deciphered
this information--

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Gerald Hawkins, the late Gerald
Hawkins, Boston University's

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.143 align:middle line:90%
Astronomer General--

00:10:53.143 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
wrote one of the most
incredible books on Stonehenge

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
back in the '60s, he
is actually the one

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:84%
that was predominately
involved in decoding

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical information
in the crop circles.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And it could also differentiate
a hoax from a real one

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
just by the amount
of mathematics

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
or the lack of inside them.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me over a
nice lunch in Washington, DC

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.485 align:middle line:90%
at a gentlemen's club--

00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
it was the height
of my personal ego

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:90%
to go to a gentlemen's club.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:84%
They even move your drink
for you, from table to table.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:90%
You can play games with them.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like, nah, I
think I want to go over there.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.075 align:middle line:84%
And they follow
you with a drink.

00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
touch your own glass.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But apart from
that, he said, well,

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
this is very interesting, this
particular design, because it

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:84%
encodes this theorem, which
is really, really difficult

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:90%
to create on a piece of paper.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Now why would anyone
do this in the middle

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:84%
of the night using an
imprecise canvas called wheat?

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.705 align:middle line:90%
And he had a very good point.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to try
and convince academics

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that you are very clever, why
not submit your dissertation

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
and have it peer reviewed?

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Rather than stay out for
five hours of total darkness

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and try plank it in
a field of wheat?

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
This is how he approached
the subject from the hoax

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.585 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:12:01.585 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you're
finished with the arguments,

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
you're left with very
little impression

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that actually humans
could really do this.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Clever guy.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But what Gerald Hawkins also
did was very interesting

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.230 align:middle line:84%
because he actually
discovered for the first time

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:90%
since the time of the Greeks--

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about I
think it's 100 BC here--

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that he's found four
new geometric theorems

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:90%
based on the works of Euclid.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Now Euclid is the
fundamental basis

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of our entire knowledge of
mathematics in the world today.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And what he found was that these
theorems are actually not found

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.972 align:middle line:84%
in Euclid's 13 books
on mathematics,

00:12:40.972 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of weird.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Because he said,
well, by logic--

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and Euclid is a
pretty clever guy.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, by logic, Euclid
would have actually figured

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:90%
these next four theorems.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And I found them
in crop circles.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
that's interesting.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:90%
What else, Gerald?

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, this
is really clever.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I actually in a
moment of-- you know,

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you call
it something else,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:84%
but I'll call it
"consciousness moment"--

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
he said, I've
actually worked out

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that if you extrapolate
from these four new theorems

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.098 align:middle line:84%
in the crop circles by logic,
there's a fifth theorem, which

00:13:14.098 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:90%
you should get to quite easily.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.765 align:middle line:84%
And he published a theorem--
actually, he didn't publish.

00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:20.473 align:middle line:90%
He put the challenge in a book--

00:13:20.473 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
magazine that was

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle line:84%
read by 200,000 mathematicians
around the world.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let's think
about this for a second.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
If people are
making crop circles.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Then it's very difficult to
create a mathematical theorem,

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:84%
let alone make one in the
middle of the night in wheat.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So how come these
four theorems exist?

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, how come we can
now take these four theorems

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and create a fifth
theorem from them?

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And I will buy anybody
a crate of champagne

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
if you can tell me
how to extrapolate

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
this fifth theorem that does
not exist from these four.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:90%
So that was the test.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, weeks went by.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Nobody cracked the code.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.328 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth week,
this thing appears

00:14:00.328 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of England.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And it actually has
the theorem in it.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit of a
joke going on here.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And it happens all the time.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you wonder who's
watching what we're doing?

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a
nasty habit of doing this

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:90%
stuff all the time.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So again, 200,000 mathematicians
peer reviewed this paper.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
well, the conclusion

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is that obviously there must be
another explanation to boards

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and pieces of string because
this theorem is pretty damn

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
difficult, and it doesn't exist
in our mathematical knowledge

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
pretty impressive

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
until one day this beautiful
little thing shows up not

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:90%
far from where I used to live.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
There were two-- I want
to call them engineers.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they were engineers.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:90%
One is a physicist.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're from London.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.683 align:middle line:84%
And it also got their
attention, and why not?

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
absolutely delicious.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:90%
You want to almost eat it.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.135 align:middle line:90%
We're back to dessert again.

00:14:56.135 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:10%
They thought, this is
really interesting.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:90%
They got on the car.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
They drove a two and 1/2 hours
to the middle of Wilshire,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.240 align:middle line:84%
because something
about this design

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:90%
really got their attention.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just put
down all of their papers.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And they thought,
let's go and do this.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:90%
And they began to measure it--

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:84%
rulers, all that kind of
stuff, laser pointers.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They took down all
the measurements.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.402 align:middle line:84%
And then the farmer came over
and said, oi, do you know,

00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
there's already been another
crop circle up here last night

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:90%
in a field next door.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.263 align:middle line:90%
And he showed them a photograph.

00:15:26.263 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely identical.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, here they are, side
by side, the two crop circles.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.142 align:middle line:84%
So whoever was making it had
a lot of time on their hands.

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.225 align:middle line:84%
They did one, and then
they went to the next field

00:15:36.225 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:90%
and made it again.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And they went and measured
the second design.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And they had a series
of discrepancies-- small

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
discrepancies between
the two designs.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So being engineers, and
mathematicians, and physicists,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.845 align:middle line:84%
they began to look at the
numbers, as they tend to do.

00:15:51.845 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And they realized,
wait a minute.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a series
of numbers here,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.540 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
telling us what we

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:90%
know about the speed of light.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So they began to look at the
second series of numbers.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, well,
if you extrapolate this,

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
you should be able to get
this, which is basically

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:90%
the second speed of light.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And the third series of numbers
is the third speed of light.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.857 align:middle line:84%
So they put this to a
peer reviewed panel.

00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
They got laughed out
of the room, of course.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, hoaxes can't
possibly be knowing anything

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.740 align:middle line:90%
about physics.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And there is only
one speed of light.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a second speed
of light, let alone a third.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And would you believe that
five years later, someone,

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:10%
somewhere, some physicist
somewhere in the world,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:10%
presented a paper.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:10%
They said, well,
actually light travels

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:10%
in two different speeds.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:40.022 align:middle line:10%
So whoever put this down here
is three steps ahead of us.

00:16:40.022 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:10%
And that was the first
inkling that we've

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:10%
been given information
that's trying

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:10%
to advance our
understanding of how

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:10%
we understand the world because
we know so little of it.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:10%
For example, we hardly know
anything about gravity.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:10%
It's a mysterious substance.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:10%
The world is covered
by 2/3 of water

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:10%
and yet we know so little about
this wondrous and mysterious

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:10%
substance.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:10%
And when we find out about
it, it is truly mysterious,

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:10%
and it can do
extraordinary things.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:10%
So by now we begin to realize
that the circle makers have

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:10%
a very high
intellectual profile,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:10%
and certainly beyond two
guys that were drinking beer

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.619 align:middle line:10%
in a pub in Hampshire
that said that they made

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.448 align:middle line:10%
all the world's crop circles--

00:17:18.448 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:10%
on the same night, on
three different continents,

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:10%
by the way.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.827 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.827 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:10%
Oh, you didn't know that story?

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, Doug and Dave at a
press meeting, they once said,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:10%
oh, yeah, we made this
particular design.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:90%
And we went, OK.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:90%
What about this one?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.295 align:middle line:84%
Because we haven't published
the information on this one.

00:17:34.295 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, we made that one, too.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:90%
And what about this one?

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, we made that one, as well.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure about this?

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, this one was
in England on July 1.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:10%
This one on July
1 was in France.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:10%
And this one is in America.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:10%
How did you manage to
cross over three continents

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:10%
and create in a few hours
of darkness in the summer

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:10%
three incredible crop circles?

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.908 align:middle line:10%
Because if you can do that,
we're going to analyze you.

00:18:02.908 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:10%
Oh, the whole story
about Doug and Dave

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:10%
is a farce that's beyond belief.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:10%
In fact, back in the day when
their story first came out,

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:10%
the tabloids in
Britain, they actually--

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:10%
the quality press after
they heard the story of Doug

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:10%
and Dave, they
said, and I quote,

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:10%
I have more ability to
believe in little green men

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.395 align:middle line:10%
than I do in believing the
story that Doug and Dave

00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:10%
had made all the crop circles.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.090 align:middle line:10%
And that was back then when
the conversation was still

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:10%
open minded.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:10%
Today, it's a very
different story, of course.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:10%
Moving forward, One.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Of my particular favorites.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of these designs
actually reveal information

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.195 align:middle line:90%
about our own planets.

00:18:41.195 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes what you
see is not what you get,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:90%
it's what's encoded in it.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it, again, is
mathematical and geometrical.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
This particular design has
a number of geometries.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
One is the pentagram, which
is hardwired in the elements,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:90%
which are flattened.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
relationship of the gaps

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:84%
in between the areas
that are risen,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:90%
and the ones that are flattened.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
The pentagram is essentially the
geometry of living organisms.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:10%
And also, the hexagram,
which is the geometry

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:10%
of non-living organisms, such
as crystals, for example.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.880 align:middle line:10%
Pentagram, hexagram,
mathematically, well, that's

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:10%
a 6:5 ratio.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.102 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to tell us?

00:19:18.102 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's very,
very important.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the 6:5 ratio
is an importance ratio

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of
life on the planet.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We on Earth are the only planet
that have this relationship.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you here
in a little graphic because--

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure like most of you--

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I did not do well with numbers
and mathematics at school.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I have to have a diagram
and then I get it.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.188 align:middle line:84%
This is why the 6:5 relationship
is very, very important.

00:19:45.188 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
heard the story again

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.165 align:middle line:84%
and again and again about the
Earth's processional cycle.

00:19:50.165 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It's really to do with
the way that the Earth

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:84%
moves in space, imperceptibly
over 25,920 years.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
rotates on its axis

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:84%
in a period of a
slow wobble that's

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.127 align:middle line:84%
imperceptible over the
course of 72 years.

00:20:05.127 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So in your own
lifetime, unless you're

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
paying really close
attention, you'll

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.230 align:middle line:84%
only notice that the background
stars relative to the horizon

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:84%
have moved one degree
in your lifetime.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a lot of
observation to understand that.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The next observation is that
while the planet is tilting

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:90%
on its axis, it also moves.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Around the equator, it moves
four degrees imperceptibly

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:90%
over 21,600 years.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the ratio that
creates 6:5 or 5:6,

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:84%
if you divide the numbers
one to themselves.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And that ratio is what
allows organic life

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:90%
to be created on the planet.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why you don't find
this ratio in other planets

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.108 align:middle line:90%
in the Solar System.

00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why sometimes
the simplest information

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
in the crop circles can lead you
to such a momentous discovery

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
of something that we really
should be very aware of.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, our ancestors
were totally aware of it.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
whole understanding

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
of how pyramids were built, how
the ancient temples were built.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:84%
They are all related to
this processional cycle.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:84%
They already understood
this 11,000 years ago.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:90%
And here's the rub--

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:84%
how would you know, if you
only see this moving one degree

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
every 72 years,
it means you have

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
to be on Earth for 26,000
years just to be aware

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:90%
that the phenomenon exists.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
How about this?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:90%
A beautiful chakra design.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
It literally represents
the total unfolding

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:90%
of light in the Hindu tradition.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:84%
There's something very
different about this design.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were going
to put this on paper,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
you are going to construct it
using the golden ratio spiral.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:10%
Now if you're not aware of
the golden ratio spiral,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:10%
is the mathematical
progression that nature

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:10%
uses to create its own
natural logarithmic spiral

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:10%
in every living organism.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
This particular
design is created

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
by rotating 22 golden ratio
spirals in contrarotation

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:90%
to create that crossover.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
One of them is pretty
difficult enough.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
22 of them is really difficult.
Because every time you

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:84%
take a board and
a piece of string,

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to rotate it in
the ratio of one to 1.614.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Try keeping that consistent.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the design
is created with 14 rings

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:90%
that come out from the center.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:10%
So when you start adding
these numbers together,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:10%
you get 44 over 14, or halve
that for simplicity, 22 over 7,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.745 align:middle line:10%
which, of course, is the
basic understanding of pi.

00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:10%
But here's the
bit I really like.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And this is why it pays
attention to look at the detail

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:10%
very closely.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:90%
The two spirals touch exactly--

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
they meet exactly down the
center at this weird angle,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%
called 32.72.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a very specific
piece of design.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So I did a bit of
research on this.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:84%
What is this weird
angle all about?

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that it points to
the understanding of gravity.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Now when you get
bored, as you do

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:84%
when you live in Maine, as I
do, and in the winter, which

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:90%
is really, really, really long.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You get bored and you
start doing things

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:84%
like taking a salt
cellar and you

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.670 align:middle line:90%
pour the salt on your table.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And you watch the
salt pouring, pouring.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.780 align:middle line:84%
This is why Stephen King
writes the way he does.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:90%
My neighbor, up the road.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, so you watch sand,
salt, anything on a table.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.107 align:middle line:10%
And you look at that wonderful
cone shape that it makes.

00:23:30.107 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:10%
It makes this lovely cone shape.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:10%
This is-- actually
this is not me

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:10%
doing the thing with
the salt seller.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:10%
That's actually the
snow on my deck,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:10%
again falling naturally
over an object,

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:10%
and it starts to
form this cone shape

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:10%
with a slope angle of 32.72.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
The weird thing is-- because
my other part of my research is

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to do with ancient sacred sites
and ancient civilizations--

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought, where have I
seen this shape before?

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:90%
This angle?

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that so many of
the world's sacred mountains--

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:10%
and specifically the ones
that are deemed to be sacred--

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.660 align:middle line:10%
actually their slope
angle seems to conform

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:10%
to that exact same ratio.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I met an
engineer one day.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, actually,
we know this.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
In physics, it's called
the angle of repose.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.160 align:middle line:10%
And we use it in the
construction industry

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:10%
But it's essentially telling
us how matter influences

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:10%
fine substances to make their
natural repose, their way they

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:10%
lie down on top of
each other, and it

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:10%
creates this natural angle.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So he was totally
fascinated by this.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:10%
So I took it a
little stage further.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that DNA is
a very interesting thing.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:10%
And there's an angle
that's actually

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.380 align:middle line:10%
inherent in the DNA spiral.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:10%
In its normal stage, the angle
of rotation of the DNA spiral

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.008 align:middle line:10%
is about 34.6 degrees.

00:24:54.008 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:10%
Now one of the key
observations that people

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.300 align:middle line:10%
make when they
visit crop circles

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:10%
is that they get
very dehydrated,

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:10%
which of course affects the
body in many, many ways.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:10%
But when you start dehydrating
the actual DNA molecule,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:10%
very weird things start to
happen to this because it

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:10%
causes a change to the
angle of this spiral,

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:10%
and it changes to 32.72.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:10%
Now here's the rub--

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:10%
because DNA provides
all the codes

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:10%
the body needs to survive.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:10%
So if people who come into
contact with the crop circles

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:10%
are describing being altered in
some way, which they do, then

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:10%
perhaps they're right.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.110 align:middle line:84%
They are experience something
at the very physical level.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And it also implies that there
is information being exchanged

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
between the crop circles and the
human body on a genetic level.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Can we prove this?

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
No, it's speculation
at the moment.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We're just going where the
facts are taking us right now.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
However, I did have an
interesting conversation

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
with a very short guy who people
think is actually really tall

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:90%
called Gregg Braden.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.560 align:middle line:90%
He's only about this high.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the hair, you see.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.077 align:middle line:84%
And we're having this
interesting conversation

00:26:06.077 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
crop circle which

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:90%
it got his attention.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I said I wasn't really
interested in crop circles.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But then I saw a
picture of this.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.358 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wait a minute.

00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:16.538 align:middle line:90%
This is very interesting.

00:26:16.538 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
between you and me, Greg,

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.430 align:middle line:84%
we actually thought it was
actually a drunk farmer going

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.735 align:middle line:90%
around with a garden roller.

00:26:21.735 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:90%
But, you know, you do the work.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.912 align:middle line:84%
You have to go and
take a look at it.

00:26:24.912 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, it's
the real thing.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Now every time the
circle makers have

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
made things which
differ from normal,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
we stumble upon some
huge new understanding.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
was happening here.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Because what he said to me
was this particular design

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
appears to be matching strategic
breaks in human DNA which

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:90%
are waiting to be coded.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, have you
got a diagram for that?

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] And he said,
well, it matches

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.150 align:middle line:10%
places in DNA which are
not coded for protein.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:10%
And his point is actually
I think very valid.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:10%
Because what he was
saying is, if you

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:10%
take the map of human DNA and
you look at what's in there,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:10%
God the creator,
the source, does not

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.413 align:middle line:10%
create things without reason.

00:27:06.413 --> 00:27:07.830 align:middle line:10%
There's a function
for everything.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:10%
Everything in nature,
form follows function.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:10%
And we, as human beings,
are part of that expression.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:10%
So why would you
leave these nine gaps,

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:10%
these points of protein,
in the human DNA

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:10%
where nothing happens?

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:10%
It's as though they're
waiting to be triggered

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.045 align:middle line:10%
by a future event or
some kind of development

00:27:25.045 --> 00:27:25.845 align:middle line:10%
in our evolution.

00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:28.440 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well, that's
actually a very good point.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:10%
Because now with
the crop circles

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:10%
happening at a particular
pinch point in our history

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.627 align:middle line:10%
where you can feel it.

00:27:34.627 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:10%
Things are coming
to a head right now.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:10%
We are in serious trouble.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So his point was that if
you take this crop circle

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and you measure the
actual flattened areas,

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and where you get an actual
break where nothing happens,

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
where the crop is
still standing,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
if you take those
breaks and place them

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:84%
as a percentage of
where they occur

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:84%
on the design relative to
the human DNA molecule,

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.670 align:middle line:84%
they hit exactly the nine parts
of the human molecule which

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:90%
are not coded for protein.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's a
very lucid point you just

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:90%
made there.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:84%
We took this little
stage further.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:84%
I got in contact with
biogeneticists in China

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
who are also looking
at this specific idea.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.905 align:middle line:84%
And it amazed them because
they were keeping very quiet

00:28:19.905 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
about some secret
experiments they were doing

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:90%
over there as they tend to do.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And they found that a change in
the local bio-electromagnetic

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
field changes the information
that is received by DNA.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And what the Chinese found is
that in laboratory experiments,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:84%
genetic information has already
been transmitted successfully

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
from one organism to
the other by altering

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the local
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Consider the implications here.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we treat crop circles
as living organisms because they

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
are also electromagnetic
and they can be measured.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what, again,
differentiates the real

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:90%
from the fake.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So it might be possible
that they are transferring

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:84%
information not
just to the planet,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:84%
but also to people who
interact with them.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.970 align:middle line:90%
And it changes their lives.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of gravity, a
good friend of mine who

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.540 align:middle line:84%
was a trance medium in England
who works with the police,

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:84%
she actually
invected information

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:90%
from a group consciousness.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
pieces of information

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
that they gave her was
that the crop circles,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.460 align:middle line:84%
you will find out through
your scientific community,

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.070 align:middle line:84%
they are partly created with
the illusion of gravity,

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, we're
going, how the hell are

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:90%
we going to prove that?

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.623 align:middle line:84%
It took about 15 years to prove,
but I think we finally did it.

00:29:37.623 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:84%
They also mentioned
that there was

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of technological
information encoded

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:90%
in these designs.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were used
visually as a symbol

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
to trigger the imagination
of certain scientists

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
around the world so we can
communicate through them.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And they will think that
this downloaded information

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:90%
about anti-gravity.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, would you believe that
before I wrote this in the book

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:10%
that they are three people
around the world that actually

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:10%
have created three
dimensional versions

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:10%
of this shape in their rooms?

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.381 align:middle line:90%
One is in Oklahoma.

00:30:10.381 --> 00:30:12.452 align:middle line:90%
It's a good country, America.

00:30:12.452 --> 00:30:16.760 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] You don't think
anything special happens here?

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:10%
The other one is in Australia.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And then there's two other
physicists in England

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
who have actually built
this design as a three

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:90%
dimensional model.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And they're saying, yes.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:90%
It actually defies gravity.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:84%
We're just waiting for
the right political moment

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to bring this out in the
public because right now?

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Not a good idea.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, things
have their own time.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like people who
develop water powered cars

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
they're found dead.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, suddenly the
car just ran them over.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Their own car ran them over.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, isn't it?

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
The guy was just
changing the oil.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.078 align:middle line:90%
Funny how that happens.

00:30:49.078 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
reason why I put this

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.912 align:middle line:90%
on the front cover of the book.

00:30:51.912 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I had the access to
the psychic material and I

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.177 align:middle line:90%
knew what it would do.

00:30:56.177 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost
like a prompt for me

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to kind of do that because
then it put the idea

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:90%
into these people's heads.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.160 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just the conduit.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And these people thought,
this is interesting.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's break it apart.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It works-- the symbol
works subconsciously.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they thought,
hey, I got really clever.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I just built an
anti-gravity device.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's the consciousness

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
was saying, that we
will work with people

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific community
who are open to this potential.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And we will basically
help you move forward

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.750 align:middle line:84%
your understanding of how
the universe really works.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.667 align:middle line:84%
Because you've hit a
wall in your development.

00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:32.875 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're still working
with combustion engines,

00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:33.880 align:middle line:90%
for heaven's sake.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:84%
That's so old-- that's
so 21st century.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're
way ahead of that.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this also
encodes a very exotic angle,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because
these things are

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:84%
built on multiple
layers of information.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:84%
On one level, yes, it's
a technological piece

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:51.090 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.830 align:middle line:84%
The other one is this
little kink here.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.462 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that the skeptics
said, oh, it's got to be man

00:31:56.462 --> 00:31:57.262 align:middle line:90%
made.

00:31:57.262 --> 00:31:58.718 align:middle line:90%
Look, they made a mistake.

00:31:58.718 --> 00:31:59.760 align:middle line:90%
It's got to a bend in it.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Haha.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually that bend
is actually very strategic

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's a specific
angle of 19.47 degrees.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And you think, what
the hell is that about?

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:84%
This angle is describing
how energy becomes

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:90%
matter in the physical plane.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take the
Earth for a second.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
If you sit at the very
core of the planet

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and you project a straight
line to the equator,

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and you move that line
19.47 degrees north,

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:84%
you hit the most active hot
spot on the face of the Earth.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's
blowing up right now.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's right next to
Kilauea volcano in Hawaii.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It's Mauna Loa volcano,
exactly at that latitude.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And literally,
what's happening here

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the Earth is
sending up a spiral

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic
energy and gravity,

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and it basically when
it hits the surface it

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:84%
manifests as the most active hot
spot on the face of the planet.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But we're not the only
ones where this happened.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take a
little travel to, let's

00:32:55.930 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, Mars, the biggest
shield volcano in the universe

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:90%
at 19.47 degree latitude.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
The great red spot of
Jupiter, 19.47 degrees.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and the sun?

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.790 align:middle line:84%
All those wonderful
solar spots that you get

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and you got those
plasma discharges,

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
they all seem to come from
19.47 degrees of latitude.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So again, they're
trying to show us

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:84%
how the universe works
so that we can become

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
more understanding of
the true nature of life

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.740 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have an
evolutionary leap, as they

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you will
find a crop circle,

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:84%
they always appear next
to ancient monuments.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.790 align:middle line:10%
Both the crop circles
and the sacred sites

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:10%
communicate to each other
using these two exotic angles

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:10%
of 19.47 degrees and 32.72.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
It's as though the two are
having a two-way conversation.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, it's almost
saying it's evidence

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that someone is
using natural laws

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and guiding them under
intelligent control.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:84%
That's usually my argument
when I talk about who's

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:90%
making crop circles.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.228 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying it's a
conscious source.

00:34:03.228 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:84%
They have complete control
of the laws of nature.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And they can bend them at will.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
trying to tell us.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:84%
That there is a way you can
work with nature effortlessly

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:90%
and you let nature do the work.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that's a fairly
interesting argument.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:21.690 align:middle line:10%
And, certainly, every genuine
crop circle obeys natural laws.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:23.719 align:middle line:10%
The first thing
that we learn to do

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:27.189 align:middle line:10%
to distinguish the real
from the fakes was this.

00:34:27.189 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:10%
This is a simple
circle four feet wide.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.610 align:middle line:10%
Not very, very big at all.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.210 align:middle line:10%
And you can see here the
mathematical progression

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.840 align:middle line:10%
that nature used to create
the golden ratio spiral.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:10%
In fact, every real crop circle
is not perfectly circular

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:10%
at all.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:10%
It's slightly oval shapes.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.199 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do that
very well with a piece

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:90%
of wood and some string.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Takes a bit of effort.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.469 align:middle line:84%
But it also means that the
center of the crop circle

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.690 align:middle line:90%
is never at the physical center.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:10%
It requires an iteration
point off center

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:10%
so that the actual
spiral can define itself

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:10%
in a near circular form.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes the central
point of the design

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:10%
can be a few feet away from
its original physical center,

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:10%
whereas if you and I were to
go out there with a stick,

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.020 align:middle line:10%
you put in the center,
and you go around.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:10%
And it can be used to make small
circles like this or really,

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:10%
really big ones, where the
center point is actually

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.950 align:middle line:10%
20 feet away from
the physical center.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Now that's pretty hard to do if
you're going to make that again

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.930 align:middle line:90%
with physical implements.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But that's not even the
bigger mystery of this.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:10%
The bigger mystery of this
is how quickly they actually

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.162 align:middle line:10%
are made.

00:35:37.162 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:10%
Here's one very,
very good example.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:10%
It's part of one
of seven circles

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:10%
around the major central circle,
which I'll show you later

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.780 align:middle line:10%
is part of a very famous story.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:10%
We actually predicted we
knew where it was going to be

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.020 align:middle line:10%
and what it was
going to look like.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:10%
And if you can't see
here, what's happening is,

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:10%
you've come from--

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm now standing in the
center of the big circle.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the circles
in the periphery of it.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm showing
here is the way

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:10%
that the plants have
literally flattened.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.640 align:middle line:10%
They've gone down in a
fraction of a second.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:10%
They're creating this
wonderful spiral.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:13.640 align:middle line:10%
And as they're doing so, they're
creating this wall at the back.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:10%
Now what happens here
is very interesting.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.440 align:middle line:10%
The spiral splits from itself.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.740 align:middle line:10%
It goes into two directions.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.220 align:middle line:10%
One goes this way
and this one actually

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:10%
goes towards the center
of the crop circle.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:10%
So it's not made
from the center out.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:10%
It's made from the outside in.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.530 align:middle line:10%
Now that's quite
difficult, in my book.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:10%
But here's the good part.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:10%
The other part split
goes around this way.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:10%
It creates this perimeter.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:10%
It then splits here to create
another circle beside it.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:10%
And, as it's returning
to its point of origin,

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.910 align:middle line:10%
the speed in which
it's being created,

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:10%
the plants are still going
down when the other ones move

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.230 align:middle line:10%
this way and the two
interlocked with each other

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:10%
above and below.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.423 align:middle line:10%
When the physicist-- in
fact, he worked for NASA.

00:36:59.423 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:10%
He said, that's fascinating.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.260 align:middle line:10%
Because in order to
have a spiral that big--

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:10%
and it was over 100
feet wide, by the way--

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.270 align:middle line:10%
in order to have that spiral
coming in and under itself

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:14.310 align:middle line:10%
like a basket weave is if you
had a downtime of 1.5 seconds.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's really, really rapid.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And what we know from 80
eyewitnesses around the world

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.545 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, they occur
within 15 seconds regardless

00:37:22.545 --> 00:37:23.345 align:middle line:90%
of the scale.

00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:25.832 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.832 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to
the plants here?

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing,
they're not damaged.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole center
of the entire mystery.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to plank this,
you would crash these plant

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.880 align:middle line:90%
straight to the ground.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:90%
You'd create breakage, damage.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when you do
it in less mature crop,

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.300 align:middle line:84%
you can get away with
a lack of damage.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But still you're pressing
the plants to the ground.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
in many crop circles

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.140 align:middle line:84%
where I'm the first person
there at the crack of dawn

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.977 align:middle line:84%
and the plants are actually
hovering above the soil.

00:37:53.977 --> 00:37:55.310 align:middle line:90%
They're not touching the ground.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:56.810 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
hovering like this.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a gap of
air between them.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And it feels really bad
when you're looking at this,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and you think, I've
got to do my work.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.265 align:middle line:84%
I've got to take pictures,
and measurements.

00:38:04.265 --> 00:38:04.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
take your boots off.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.773 align:middle line:84%
And you walk with
your feet, and you

00:38:07.773 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:84%
can hear the plants being
pressed for the first time

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's magical
and yet, kind of

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.720 align:middle line:90%
shameful at the same time.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like putting
graffiti on the Sistine Chapel

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:90%
ceiling.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.225 align:middle line:90%
It's that kind of feeling.

00:38:20.225 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:90%
But here's the weird thing.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:84%
We began to notice that the
roots of the affected plants

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:84%
aren't going towards
the center of the Earth.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.690 align:middle line:84%
If you're a gardener,
you'll understand this.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:84%
When you pull plants
out of the ground,

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:90%
the roots are going that way.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
In the real crop
circles, the roots

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
are pointing in the
other direction.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.300 align:middle line:84%
They're pointing
horizontally, suggesting

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that the local gravitational
field may have been tampered

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.810 align:middle line:84%
with, which is exactly
what they told us 20 years

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.520 align:middle line:90%
before the phenomenon appeared.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:84%
That there was something to do
with the illusion of gravity,

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.042 align:middle line:90%
as they called it.

00:38:51.042 --> 00:38:53.000 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that
happens to be your plants

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:84%
in the genuine
circles, of course,

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.670 align:middle line:84%
is that the plants themselves
are filled with liquid, OK?

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you apply
energy to plants-- let's

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:90%
say, sound and light.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Because when you throw
light and spin it

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
in an incredible fast
speed, it starts creating

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.330 align:middle line:90%
a high degree of temperature.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:10%
And in this point,
the temperature

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:20.060 align:middle line:10%
created in a very rapid 1.5
second measurement of time,

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:10%
it generates a heating effect
of 1,500 degrees Celsius.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you transpose
that theory to a wheat field

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:30.080 align:middle line:84%
is that the water
inside the plant

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.338 align:middle line:84%
is super heated in a fraction
of a second, and it expands.

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
If you've made a
cup of tea, you know

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.980 align:middle line:84%
that there's always bit
more water in the pot

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.780 align:middle line:90%
before it boils.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that now
the water has nowhere to go.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:90%
It's in an enclosed space.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:90%
So what does it do?

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:84%
It looks for the weakest
part of the plant, which

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.680 align:middle line:90%
is the knuckle.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, the plant's node.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, here, what's happened
is that the water has

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:84%
gone to look for the
weakest part of the plant

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.415 align:middle line:90%
and it's blown out of itself.

00:39:56.415 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the farmers
who have witnessed these crop

00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:90%
circles--

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.863 align:middle line:84%
usually around 4 in the morning,
after hearing strange sounds--

00:40:02.863 --> 00:40:04.280 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, well,
the first thing

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
we see is like a column
of vapor coming out

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:90%
of the center of the field.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're absolutely right.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the water
molecule inside the plant

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:90%
has been atomized.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:90%
That creates steam.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's a very dramatic example.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Heat has been used here to
flash burn the plant stems which

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.730 align:middle line:84%
were lying on top of a piece
of a stone in the middle

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.260 align:middle line:90%
of a field of a crop circle.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can still see
how the plants still

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:90%
steam onto each stone itself.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.110 align:middle line:90%


00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:36.892 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can do that is
with Gorilla glue, which I know

00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:37.850 align:middle line:90%
wasn't happening here--

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:38.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.610 align:middle line:84%
--or heat where the
plant literally becomes

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.983 align:middle line:90%
melted onto another surface.

00:40:42.983 --> 00:40:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating stuff, isn't it?

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.522 align:middle line:84%
It was worth giving
up my day job for.

00:40:46.522 --> 00:40:47.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:10%
Now let's examine the mechanics
to determine the process

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:52.880 align:middle line:10%
of what's going on here.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.630 align:middle line:10%
I used to work with a colleague
of mine who passed away.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:10%
This phenomenon, by the way,
has a high level of death.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Most of the people
who research this

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.805 align:middle line:10%
are either retired,
semi-retired,

00:41:02.805 --> 00:41:07.220 align:middle line:10%
or dead, and not because of
nefarious purposes either.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.350 align:middle line:10%
It's just a weird thing.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.030 align:middle line:10%
It also has a very high--

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:10%
I think like a 96% level
of divorce in this subject.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.380 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:10%
I think because we get so
passionate and so involved

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.703 align:middle line:10%
in it that it's
like, eh, I'm going

00:41:20.703 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:10%
back to doing what
I'm doing in my life.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.120 align:middle line:10%
You go and measure plants.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.430 align:middle line:10%
It's the way it is.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.020 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you have
to give up things.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.170 align:middle line:10%
And so what I was
looking at here

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:10%
was how do we measure the actual
frequency of the crop circles.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:10%
If these things are
electromagnetic,

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:10%
there must be a way to actually
figure this out and measure it.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:10%
We've got the equipment today.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.380 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the things
that we began to look at

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.440 align:middle line:10%
was what's happening
with the actual soil.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.630 align:middle line:10%
We found a laboratory
in Cambridge in England,

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:10%
and they actually validated that
there are unusually high levels

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:58.400 align:middle line:10%
of nitrate in soil following
an appearance of a crop

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.040 align:middle line:10%
circle, a real one.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:10%
And there's only two ways to
increase the nitrate level

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:03.530 align:middle line:10%
in soil.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:07.250 align:middle line:10%
One is by the over
application of fertilizer,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.150 align:middle line:10%
which of course tends
to kill the plants.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.910 align:middle line:10%
And that's not what's
happening here.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.480 align:middle line:10%
And two is by administering
an extremely high

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:10%
electrical charge.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, with this in
mind, we figured

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.270 align:middle line:10%
that we'd go into
the crop circles

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.190 align:middle line:10%
and we'd start measuring
the frequencies.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we did
for many, many years.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I would go in with my
little dowsing rods.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm a dowser as well.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, no one really
wants to believe in dousing,

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.120 align:middle line:90%
or few people do.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
convince the skeptics,

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:84%
my colleague, Paul,
also deceased--

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:38.930 align:middle line:90%
lovely fellow.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:41.850 align:middle line:84%
He developed his own little
what he called his gizmo.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And we'd walked down these--
track the lines together.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:90%
I would be over here.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:90%
He'd be over here.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be looking for
something very specific.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And the rods would go like this.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And he'd go, oh, blimey.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:52.190 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.303 align:middle line:84%
He'd get a spike in
the actual readings

00:42:54.303 --> 00:42:55.970 align:middle line:84%
or the background
frequencies the moment

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.040 align:middle line:84%
we'd hit the perimeter
of the crop circle.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So he'd be measuring the
background frequency, which

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.830 align:middle line:84%
would be about 150 megahertz
in the middle of a wheat field.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty high.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But then again, we're surrounded
with so many cell phone towers,

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and you expect a
lot of interference.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you cross
that perimeter, wow,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.240 align:middle line:90%
that's a big jump suddenly.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And then as you're
walking further down,

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:84%
see how the readings go down
ever so slightly and then

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.800 align:middle line:90%
back up?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And then down, and then
back up a bit more.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And then back down,
back a bit more.

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:23.930 align:middle line:90%


00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're actually
looking at this, on a chart.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.230 align:middle line:84%
There's like a wave
form going on here.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But the closer you
get to the center,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:84%
the higher the background
frequency, to the point

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.380 align:middle line:84%
where you hit this ring
here of about 500 megahertz.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.717 align:middle line:84%
You're halfway to microwave
basically, but not at the point

00:43:40.717 --> 00:43:42.300 align:middle line:84%
where it's actually
damaging anything.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at this
level of frequency,

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.300 align:middle line:84%
it actually starts to
stimulate your brainwaves.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.530 align:middle line:10%
You start having altered
states of consciousness,

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:53.300 align:middle line:10%
and that's something that occurs
again and again and again.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.460 align:middle line:10%
I thought that was pretty
cool, until you actually

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.842 align:middle line:10%
step across this
invisible ring here.

00:43:57.842 --> 00:43:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Once you cross
through here and you

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.500 align:middle line:84%
expect the meter to go way
over and above the scale,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.527 align:middle line:90%
actually there's nothing.

00:44:05.527 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And we're both sitting in there.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.827 align:middle line:90%
And we're going--

00:44:07.827 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
inside this tube.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And, suddenly, you become very
aware-- you feel very naked.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you are very aware of
the next levels of reality.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean levels.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.058 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing separating
you between everything else.

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You look like-- you feel like
someone's actually looking down

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.300 align:middle line:84%
upon you and you
have no clothes on.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
is, when people

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.530 align:middle line:84%
take their animals in
here, they actually

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.700 align:middle line:90%
start getting a bit spooked.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.200 align:middle line:84%
They start looking
around like this.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Going, hm, something's going on.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And animals know,
better than we do.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:10%
And they'll know where
the hot spot of energy

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.870 align:middle line:10%
is because they
always go and mark it,

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:10%
as animals do, with a certain
cocking of the leg, which

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.140 align:middle line:10%
is why it's very important
to take your soil samples

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and plant samples
really, really early.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:51.830 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:10%
What's this substance?

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.500 align:middle line:10%
It's very interesting.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:53.720 align:middle line:10%
Oh, no.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.550 align:middle line:10%
It's not.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:55.490 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:57.445 align:middle line:10%
And it's not where you
think it is, actually.

00:44:57.445 --> 00:44:59.570 align:middle line:10%
The battery for the crop
circle is actually-- there

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:00.620 align:middle line:10%
it is on this particular one.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.120 align:middle line:10%
There's the hot
spot right there.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Nowhere near here.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, you can't take
any preconceived notion

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.780 align:middle line:84%
into this research because
you will be disproved.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to go into this
with a very open mind.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're just learning
everything as children,

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're being
led by the facts.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.460 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:84%
This is where the dogs and
the cats would go in here

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.330 align:middle line:90%
and mark their territory.

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd
leave in a hurry.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.260 align:middle line:84%
They feel there's
a frequency there.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.517 align:middle line:90%
Nothing that it's nefarious.

00:45:25.517 --> 00:45:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They just feel threatened
by it because it's

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:29.080 align:middle line:90%
a very high level of frequency.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that's also very
sensitive picks this up.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The other way you
can also figure out

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that this is actually
happening in the real crop

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.440 align:middle line:84%
circles and not
the man made ones

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.370 align:middle line:84%
is that when you actually
take literally equipment

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and in some of the cases
the frequencies are so high

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.920 align:middle line:84%
they begin to interfere
with LCD displays.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Anything with liquid
crystal goes black.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the packs
of batteries that you take in.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.600 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, all the packs
of batteries are dead.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.800 align:middle line:10%
Cameras fail.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.860 align:middle line:10%
And in one famous occasion
when the BBC crew came in

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.045 align:middle line:10%
to film us, they
were across the--

00:46:03.045 --> 00:46:04.670 align:middle line:10%
they would be very
excited that they're

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:10%
going to make these incredible
paranormal researchers look

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.207 align:middle line:10%
very silly.

00:46:10.207 --> 00:46:12.290 align:middle line:10%
They were across the
perimeter of the crop circle.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:16.430 align:middle line:10%
And there'll be a very agonizing
array of red warning lights.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.860 align:middle line:10%
And $28,000 cameras
suddenly go, poof.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.830 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:24.030 align:middle line:10%
And we said, we told
you not to film inside.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.830 align:middle line:10%
This is why.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.560 align:middle line:10%
They'd bring another camera
and they would do it outside,

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.640 align:middle line:10%
and the interview is perfect.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.440 align:middle line:10%
And then on a--

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:10%
they forget.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.858 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I'll just go inside
and take some closeups.

00:46:32.858 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:10%
Second camera goes in,
crosses the perimeter, poof.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:37.440 align:middle line:10%
Told you.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.240 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.044 align:middle line:10%
It's a very
expensive phenomenon.

00:46:40.044 --> 00:46:41.406 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:41.406 --> 00:46:42.770 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Water and geology can also
generate an electrical charge,

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.050 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
funny, because when

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.520 align:middle line:84%
we began to look at where the
main groups of crop circles

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.820 align:middle line:90%
appear around the world--

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:84%
which is not just southern
Britain, by the way.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The other 20% usually appear
around the Canadian prairie.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Today the real crop circles--

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.170 align:middle line:84%
the few that there are-- appear
around Ohio, of all places.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, also
one of my mailing

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:84%
list-- my biggest mailing
list is actually in Ohio.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.170 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the regeneration
of mysticism in Ohio people.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:16.280 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, little Ohio where
you think very conservative,

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I have more people coming
out of the woodwork

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.557 align:middle line:84%
to presentations than anywhere
in the rest of the country.

00:47:24.557 --> 00:47:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's actually
very encouraging

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.910 align:middle line:84%
when you think that
actually people

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:84%
like us are doing this in
small parts of the country

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that you never hear of, and
they're doing good stuff.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually very
reassuring and positive.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So we began to track where
do the crop circles appear?

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.330 align:middle line:10%
Well, they appear in
this particular band

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.150 align:middle line:10%
in the south of England.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.950 align:middle line:10%
And they're representing a
specific type of geology,

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.410 align:middle line:10%
and that's chalk.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.070 align:middle line:10%
OK, we have the
deepest chalk aquifer

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:49.600 align:middle line:10%
in the south of England.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.430 align:middle line:10%
In the next biggest
concentration,

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.650 align:middle line:10%
by a huge margin, is
the Canadian prairie.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, that sits on
limestone, which

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.970 align:middle line:10%
is a chemical twin of chalk.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.190 align:middle line:10%
And there is a
disproportionate relationship

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.100 align:middle line:10%
here of crop circles
relating to this geology,

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.090 align:middle line:10%
and also sources of water.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:10%
Not just the aquifer,
but rivers, ponds.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:10%
Wherever you find crop circles,
they want and need the water.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.970 align:middle line:10%
87% of them reference
sources of water.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Now water in itself
is not a conductor

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of electrical
currents unless it is

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.820 align:middle line:84%
saturated with an alkali,
such as dissolved chalk

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.010 align:middle line:90%
or limestone.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.080 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
thing that we noticed

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.780 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship,
the strategic relationship

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of the placement
of these things.

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.090 align:middle line:10%
Now chalk and limestone
are both composed

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.595 align:middle line:10%
of billions of sea creatures.

00:48:38.595 --> 00:48:39.970 align:middle line:10%
And all of these
little creatures

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:10%
contain small pieces
of magnetite in them.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:45.560 align:middle line:10%
But they are also piezoelectric.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.340 align:middle line:10%
So when you compress
limestone and chalk,

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.860 align:middle line:10%
you create a building
of static pressure,

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.190 align:middle line:10%
which creates a natural
static charge in the land.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:10%
And that's why you also
find so many sacred sites

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.670 align:middle line:10%
on the same geology, like
at Giza, southern Briton.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.790 align:middle line:84%
They also are looking for
that natural electrical charge

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.100 align:middle line:90%
already present on the ground.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.560 align:middle line:10%
So the net effect of
pressurized magnetites,

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.510 align:middle line:10%
together with energized
to the groundwater,

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.505 align:middle line:10%
is the creation of a
low magnetic field.

00:49:13.505 --> 00:49:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
southern Britain,

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:17.290 align:middle line:84%
in particular, one of
the world's largest

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.420 align:middle line:84%
natural conductors
of electrical current

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and, again, why so many
thousands of sacred sites

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.803 align:middle line:90%
exist around here.

00:49:25.803 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:10%
In fact, wherever
the crop circles

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:10%
appear in 29 countries
around the world,

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.770 align:middle line:10%
they have always referenced
the local ancient sacred sites.

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:36.130 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
tell you something.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
eventually led me to, well,

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.350 align:middle line:84%
writing the books
that I have now

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.900 align:middle line:84%
based on the development
of this topic.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's been in
education in itself.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.880 align:middle line:10%
Because the sacred
sites, by themselves,

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.410 align:middle line:10%
happen to be without exception
all located on the Earth's

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.480 align:middle line:10%
telluric pathways of energy.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Not ley lines, by the way.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Very different things.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.868 align:middle line:84%
I'm just talking about
the energy currents that

00:49:59.868 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:84%
flow through the Earth, just
like human beings have arteries

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and veins, the Earth has
the same thing, as well.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And coincidentally,
the crop circles

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.250 align:middle line:84%
also appear exactly on
the same energy lines.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So there is a relationship that
they keep trying to tell us.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.115 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
tell us that something

00:50:17.115 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
about the sacred
space that we've

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.540 align:middle line:84%
stopped using for a
few thousand years,

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the crop circles are now
referencing the sciences there.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.170 align:middle line:84%
You should be paying attention
to what they left here

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.480 align:middle line:90%
a long, long time ago.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And it is indeed
true that the two

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.410 align:middle line:84%
share the same
electromagnetic pathways.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.930 align:middle line:84%
This particular weird
looking ant design

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:84%
which, again, we first thought,
oh, it's got to be a joke.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:90%
It can't be real.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It turns out it's
the real thing.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.702 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
bends in the nodes.

00:50:42.702 --> 00:50:43.660 align:middle line:90%
You look at the energy.

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.430 align:middle line:90%
You look at the samples.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is the real thing.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a line along
the pathway through that

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:53.080 align:middle line:90%
field-- and only in that field--

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.810 align:middle line:84%
where there's a
major energy current.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.770 align:middle line:10%
We don't even have to measure
it because the farmer came out.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.470 align:middle line:10%
We-- someone-- actually, there
is a bit of a funny story.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:03.850 align:middle line:10%
Because usually
we get permission

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.440 align:middle line:10%
from the farmer to go in.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.510 align:middle line:10%
And we thought we had actually
been given permission.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.360 align:middle line:10%
We spoke to one of the
people at the farm.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:14.340 align:middle line:10%
And they said, OK, you can go
in and that'll be 10 pounds.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:10%
All right, 10 pounds.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:16.510 align:middle line:10%
We'll go in.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:17.710 align:middle line:10%
Just leave us alone.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.670 align:middle line:10%
While we're in there writing
things, sitting in this design,

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.490 align:middle line:10%
a very angry guy with
a red face runs down

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:26.880 align:middle line:10%
with overalls, with
his hands like this,

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.640 align:middle line:10%
and says, oi, get off my land.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:10%
And I said, are
you by any chance

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.530 align:middle line:10%
the actual owner of the farm?

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:32.540 align:middle line:10%
He said, I be that man.

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.340 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.080 align:middle line:10%
That guy down there had
just taken 20 of our pounds,

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.130 align:middle line:10%
and he's impersonating you.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.210 align:middle line:10%
Crop circles are a
great way to make money.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:42.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.547 align:middle line:90%
So he said, really?

00:51:43.547 --> 00:51:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll be having a
word with them later.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, did
you know that this crop

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.650 align:middle line:90%
circle is one of the--

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.530 align:middle line:84%
it's one of those what
you call energy lines.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my dogs act really
weird when they walk

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:56.410 align:middle line:90%
across the top of the hill.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell where they
are because the ancient tree,

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.715 align:middle line:84%
the druids planted
the trees there,

00:52:00.715 --> 00:52:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to tell you where the
energy is going to end.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:03.673 align:middle line:90%
It goes to the other side.

00:52:03.673 --> 00:52:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And we went, let's measure this.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And he was absolutely right.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So, again, the farmers
are so tapped into this.

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And once you make
friends with them,

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:90%
they become your best allies.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:16.030 align:middle line:84%
We thought that was kind
of fun until I thought--

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.830 align:middle line:90%
well, actually, no.

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:18.372 align:middle line:84%
I was standing in
the middle of this.

00:52:18.372 --> 00:52:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And, again, you
start downloading

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.130 align:middle line:84%
information you
think it's coming

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.730 align:middle line:90%
from your own imagination.

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.525 align:middle line:84%
After a while, you realize
you're being fed the lines.

00:52:25.525 --> 00:52:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
why don't you

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
measure the bends and the
angles of these lines?

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.970 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, why not?

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:33.803 align:middle line:84%
While I'm here, I've
got my measuring thing.

00:52:33.803 --> 00:52:34.730 align:middle line:90%
I've got my compass.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Would you believe that
this design actually

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:43.670 align:middle line:84%
references this entire array
for 40 square miles of all

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.730 align:middle line:90%
the local ancient sacred sites?

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And you, in a valley, you have
no idea where these things are.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I had to go and get a
map to figure this out.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
extraordinary amount

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:53.900 align:middle line:90%
of referencing that's going on.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it's point--
it's telling us--

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.040 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to focus
on the ancient places

00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that we inherited for
thousands of years

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:03.970 align:middle line:90%
for some unspecified reason.

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So none of this can be
seen from the ground.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.770 align:middle line:84%
You actually have to
actually go and do the work,

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.312 align:middle line:84%
or you have to work
with a satellite.

00:53:09.312 --> 00:53:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is
happening here, there's

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:84%
an airborne component
to this phenomenon.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And, indeed, talking to a
lot of the eyewitnesses,

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about the
beams of light coming down,

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.650 align:middle line:84%
rotating the crop, back
up again in 15 seconds,

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:26.950 align:middle line:84%
we began to actually do studies
looking at the magnetic fields

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:27.820 align:middle line:90%
of the designs.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:31.300 align:middle line:10%
Because if light is involved,
then electricity and magnetism

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.370 align:middle line:10%
have to be involved, too.

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:35.390 align:middle line:10%
This is a very dramatic
example, again,

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:38.770 align:middle line:10%
of a simple design which never
gets anybody's attention.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's
because they don't actually

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.927 align:middle line:84%
enjoy all the frivolous activity
that goes with crop circles.

00:53:45.927 --> 00:53:47.260 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a tourist attraction.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:48.440 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it's about.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, every
year I hear about,

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.070 align:middle line:90%
well, that was a great season.

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait for
the next season.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.250 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what it's about.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:56.573 align:middle line:90%
It's not a performance.

00:53:56.573 --> 00:53:58.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a piece of
serious communication

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.220 align:middle line:90%
that's taking place here.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not here to perform.

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So they make the
simple ones to allow us

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.770 align:middle line:84%
the time to actually
make big discoveries.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
seeing here, these

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:12.250 align:middle line:84%
are the printouts from
the magnetometer survey.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're dragging a
magnetometer over the area.

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And this shows that the
area inside the crop circle

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:middle line:84%
has a heightened
magnetic activity.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And you see how
it relates pretty

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.040 align:middle line:84%
much to the actual
flattened area.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.170 align:middle line:84%
If you transpose
that into a 3D graph,

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that's actually
what it looks like.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:29.830 align:middle line:84%
That's your heightened
magnetic field.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to pretty
much reference the way

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.030 align:middle line:90%
that this has been flattened.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So these little advances,
you know, year after year,

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.490 align:middle line:84%
slowly teaching us how
these things are working,

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.790 align:middle line:84%
begin to tell us that
there is a resonance field.

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when we began to
measure outside the designs,

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:47.860 align:middle line:84%
we began to realize that
the energy isn't just

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.790 align:middle line:90%
contained inside.

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It's rippling outside, like
throwing a stone into a pond,

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and the ripples get weaker and
weaker the further away you

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:57.530 align:middle line:90%
go from the design.

00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:59.720 align:middle line:84%
They behaved like
peaks and troughs.

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.150 align:middle line:84%
That are high points
and low points.

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And there is also radiation
and soil composition

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that fluctuates in
tandem with these higher

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and lower frequencies that
are measured inside the crop

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:13.040 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So the more you veer away from
the epicenter of the design,

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.450 align:middle line:90%
the weaker the signal becomes.

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, it is feasible
that these are fingerprints

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that are left by
an energy source

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:27.430 align:middle line:84%
as it hits the ground
from an aerial component,

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and it creates a
kind of shock wave.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of like that theory
because it's a process that's

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.080 align:middle line:90%
known in physics.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Here's a diagram which
shows a vertical wire.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.060 align:middle line:84%
A wire that carries
an electric current

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:84%
has an associated
magnetic field whose field

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:84%
lines are detected as a
series of concentric rings.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.240 align:middle line:84%
However, the field
strength is actually

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:56.350 align:middle line:84%
reduced the further
it gets from the wire.

00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:58.510 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we figure this
out, another crop circle

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.780 align:middle line:84%
appears to describe that
that's what's happening here.

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Because this has actually
taken place under high tension

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:07.480 align:middle line:90%
electrical cables.

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
one theory that

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.440 align:middle line:84%
was being proposed by the
skeptics with their media

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.310 align:middle line:84%
allies that while the crop
circles are made by balloonist

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and they come from above,
and the balloons come

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to the ground, and the
other shapes that you see

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.450 align:middle line:84%
are the baskets of
the balloon rotating.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:23.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Any balloonists here?

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Any people gone up in a
balloon with a basket?

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go around
with a basket several times

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and create a perfect
circle without any damage,

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:33.700 align:middle line:90%
and they got--

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.460 align:middle line:84%
well, this refuted the
theory quite quickly.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Prior to doing that,
your feet would

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.300 align:middle line:84%
get pretty hot in your
basket pretty quickly.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.635 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:41.635 --> 00:56:42.800 align:middle line:90%


00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.600 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the weird thing that
I love about this phenomenon

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.580 align:middle line:84%
because not only did
the crop circle appear

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.800 align:middle line:84%
under electrical
cables, the energy that

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:55.010 align:middle line:84%
seems to come from above
has carried along the wires,

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:56.890 align:middle line:84%
it's reached its first
point of grounding,

00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:59.650 align:middle line:84%
which is at this pole, the
energy has gone down the pole.

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:01.690 align:middle line:90%
And look what's happened here.

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:03.490 align:middle line:84%
The energy discharged
has created

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.253 align:middle line:84%
a pattern that's kind of similar
to what's happening here.

00:57:06.253 --> 00:57:07.420 align:middle line:90%
But that was not deliberate.

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:10.450 align:middle line:84%
That was a byproduct of
the energy coming down here

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:11.660 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why it looks a
bit shoddy, you see?

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.435 align:middle line:84%
So, again, the details
are very important,

00:57:16.435 --> 00:57:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're got to keep
looking at this stuff,

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.380 align:middle line:84%
because they keep giving
you the information.

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.530 align:middle line:90%
It's right in front of you.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:25.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who are following
my conspiracy that sheep

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:31.100 align:middle line:84%
are taking over the world,
this is the latest piece

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:31.900 align:middle line:90%
of evidence.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:32.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a very rare
photograph that

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.840 align:middle line:84%
was taken with a very long
lens, working undercover,

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and it shows the Armored
Division of the sheep spotted

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:42.958 align:middle line:90%
during secret maneuvers.

00:57:42.958 --> 00:57:44.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I've had this
theory for 15 years.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's coming true.

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Beware of the sheep conspiracy.

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:53.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at how do you go
about making a crop circle?

00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:59.190 align:middle line:10%
Some crop circles
link to each other

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:03.840 align:middle line:10%
and provide a story that
describes their very function.

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.680 align:middle line:84%
They actually work like
a kind of triptych.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.180 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the
clues and the way

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.910 align:middle line:10%
that some relate to each other,
you think, wait a minute.

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.910 align:middle line:10%
Those three belong together.

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:15.030 align:middle line:10%
And here are three that came
over in one particular season.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:17.520 align:middle line:10%
Because each season
had its own message.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.300 align:middle line:10%
And we began to realize that
every season if we, as humans,

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.050 align:middle line:10%
understand what they're
trying to tell us,

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:23.970 align:middle line:10%
they'll up the ante
the next season.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:25.490 align:middle line:10%
There's never a dull moment.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:28.330 align:middle line:10%
It's the taking on a sort
of premeditated course,

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:30.130 align:middle line:10%
if I want to say this.

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:31.958 align:middle line:84%
So these three
particular designs

00:58:31.958 --> 00:58:33.000 align:middle line:90%
kind of got my attention.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship
between them.

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't explain
it at the time.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And I took a look at
this one first here.

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful,
beautiful design.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:43.080 align:middle line:10%
And it actually began to tell us
about the shielding effect that

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.900 align:middle line:10%
happens around the
perimeter of the design.

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.970 align:middle line:10%
The design itself, it actually
suggest a spinning wheel.

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And if you actually look
at the importance of spin

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:55.110 align:middle line:10%
in the creation of matter,
it's important to know

00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:56.610 align:middle line:10%
that the spinning
vortex is actually

00:58:56.610 --> 00:59:00.120 align:middle line:10%
capable of generating
its own magnetic field,

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:03.660 align:middle line:10%
particularly if it happens over
water, which itself is also

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.210 align:middle line:10%
a conductor of electromagnetism,
as we saw earlier.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:10.560 align:middle line:10%
So spin is very much
a part and parcel

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.550 align:middle line:10%
of how the crop
circles are created.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:15.690 align:middle line:84%
But you can create its
own magnetic field.

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
this particular shape

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:20.880 align:middle line:90%
is called a hysteresis loop.

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.160 align:middle line:84%
To put this in
layman's terms, it

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.040 align:middle line:84%
is a curve describing how
a non-magnetic object,

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.390 align:middle line:84%
such as a plant, is
given a magnetic field

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:36.030 align:middle line:84%
strength by manipulating
the local magnetic field.

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And such a change can be used to
either repel or contain energy,

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:44.450 align:middle line:84%
making the crop circle act like
an invisible electric fence.

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:46.140 align:middle line:90%
At least the perimeter anyway.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned before,
as I have found out

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and as TV cameras
have found out,

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:53.820 align:middle line:84%
electrical equipment is
interfered with precisely

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:58.450 align:middle line:84%
at the moment you enter the
perimeter of the circle.

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Here's a lovely example of how
this energy field is really

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.930 align:middle line:84%
highly contained
within the perimeter

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:08.423 align:middle line:84%
and is used to create really,
really sharp, fine detail.

01:00:08.423 --> 01:00:09.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of
the small details

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.950 align:middle line:84%
are so priceless you actually
don't even want to touch them.

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.530 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Then there is this
particular design.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:21.230 align:middle line:84%
There is actually a
subtle gravitational shift

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.070 align:middle line:90%
in crop circles.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It took us a while to figure
this out because gravity is

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:28.260 align:middle line:90%
still a very unknown subject.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
The first clue was
exemplified by the way

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that the plant's roots are
pointing the wrong direction.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Something has happened here that
shouldn't be doing in nature.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, some adjustment of
the local gravitational field

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.720 align:middle line:90%
is taking place.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.443 align:middle line:84%
And how this is done is
the biggest of mysteries.

01:00:44.443 --> 01:00:46.610 align:middle line:10%
But when these Japanese
scientists finally came over

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.700 align:middle line:10%
to England, they did
detect a four degree

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:54.800 align:middle line:10%
shift in the local gravitational
field in the real crop circles.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.635 align:middle line:10%
And, clearly, this
was a major-- in fact,

01:00:56.635 --> 01:01:00.560 align:middle line:10%
a monumental discovery because
it was actually validated

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.980 align:middle line:10%
by the circle makers
with this design,

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:07.490 align:middle line:10%
which appeared exactly as it--

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:09.410 align:middle line:10%
yes, it appeared
exactly the moment

01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:12.930 align:middle line:10%
that they are presenting this
at a conference 10 miles away,

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.750 align:middle line:10%
this thing appears
in broad daylight.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:17.090 align:middle line:10%
And it actually
shows how a stand--

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.710 align:middle line:10%
the standing wall
of the crop circle

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:20.990 align:middle line:10%
has been shifted
exactly four degrees

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:23.400 align:middle line:10%
to create this vortex shape.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So, again, the validation
is always happening

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.130 align:middle line:90%
again and again and again.

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
call peer review.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.886 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:31.886 --> 01:01:32.730 align:middle line:90%


01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't wait for published.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Just present it and, oh,
and someone just ran in

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and they said, you won't believe
what just happened in a field

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.640 align:middle line:90%
about 10 miles away from here.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.300 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- I think
it's proven your theory.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.230 align:middle line:90%
And they went, oh.

01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:44.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.820 align:middle line:90%
There were great.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So is it being suggested
here that the four degree

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
shift enables energy
or information

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.730 align:middle line:90%
to flow between worlds?

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Are we shown-- are we
being shown the mechanics

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:01.200 align:middle line:90%
of an interdimensional window?

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because consider for one
second that all crop circles

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
appear between 2 and
4 in the morning.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.180 align:middle line:10%
We didn't know why until
I had a conversation

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.760 align:middle line:10%
with the high ranking person at
the London College of Medicine.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.760 align:middle line:10%
And usually when you come
up with a conversation

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.200 align:middle line:10%
of crop circles
at dinner parties,

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.070 align:middle line:10%
you don't get invited again.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.540 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.690 align:middle line:10%
And I wished I hadn't
opened my mouth.

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:27.330 align:middle line:10%
And he was looking me kind of,
now, that's very interesting.

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.435 align:middle line:10%
I said, oh, thank god for that.

01:02:29.435 --> 01:02:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well,
actually, it's

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.820 align:middle line:10%
interesting because if all--
are you saying all crop

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.740 align:middle line:10%
circles appear between
2 and 4 in the morning?

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.330 align:middle line:10%
I said, pretty much, with very
rare daylight occurrences.

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:38.130 align:middle line:10%
He said, what?

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.920 align:middle line:10%
Is that-- is that meaningful?

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.380 align:middle line:10%
Meaningful?

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:45.750 align:middle line:10%
95% of all reported hospital
deaths occur between 2 and 4

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.190 align:middle line:10%
in the morning.

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.640 align:middle line:10%
Big silence.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.840 align:middle line:10%
Like, wait a minute, 2 and
4 in the morning, that's

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.470 align:middle line:10%
the part of the Earth that's
furthest from the gravitational

01:02:55.470 --> 01:03:00.000 align:middle line:10%
pull of the sun, which means
the gravitational field is going

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.720 align:middle line:10%
to sleep for a couple of hours,
which means that the soul is

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.380 align:middle line:10%
allowed to leave, and
information enters the Earth.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.680 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, now that's
a good dinner conversation.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.850 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:13.620 align:middle line:10%
The Native Americans
call that the sipapu

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.480 align:middle line:10%
reed, the reed of heaven.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.940 align:middle line:10%
And you find those in the kivas.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.680 align:middle line:10%
So there's some truth
to this, as well.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.360 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it just
literally harmonized

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.000 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years of
traditional understanding

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.854 align:middle line:10%
of how energy works.

01:03:25.854 --> 01:03:27.562 align:middle line:10%
They actually call it
the reeds of heaven

01:03:27.562 --> 01:03:31.140 align:middle line:10%
and how the crop circle
mechanism works with gravity,

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.240 align:middle line:10%
and when it's lying and having
a little sleep of its own.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, that four
degree shift, it turns out,

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.790 align:middle line:84%
it's actually referencing what
is perhaps the most famous crop

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:40.590 align:middle line:90%
circle.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It really galvanized people
around the world back in--

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.660 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 1989.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
My memory's starting to
get a little bit fuzzy.

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:48.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:52.458 align:middle line:84%
All those ratchets are literally
moved exactly by four degrees.

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
diagram that was used

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to create those anti-gravity
designs I talked about earlier.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly and lastly, there's
the use of sound and light.

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.490 align:middle line:10%
These two particular
spirals can be

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:09.090 align:middle line:10%
interpreted as transverse
waves of electromagnetism.

01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:11.700 align:middle line:10%
In other words, how the
electricity goes in one wave,

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.220 align:middle line:10%
magnetism goes in
the other wave.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It can also be a
representation of human DNA,

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
except human DNA does not have
that line going through it, OK?

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:25.710 align:middle line:84%
That does not belong
in human DNA at all.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:28.990 align:middle line:10%
There's this transverse
line of circles.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:32.040 align:middle line:10%
So why are these circles there?

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not about DNA.

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:35.253 align:middle line:10%
It's all about something
very different.

01:04:35.253 --> 01:04:37.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is where you start
looking at electromagnetism,

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:39.960 align:middle line:10%
how it behaves in waves.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.780 align:middle line:10%
Sound, on the other hand,
does not travel in waves.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.880 align:middle line:10%
It travels longitudinally,
in straight lines.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.570 align:middle line:10%
And then I recently discovered
the sound waves are not just

01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:50.830 align:middle line:10%
linear, they're also spherical.

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:53.070 align:middle line:10%
So what the point, they're
trying to tell us here,

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:57.400 align:middle line:10%
is that we have two transverse
waves, going around each other,

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.970 align:middle line:10%
creating a kind of
tube, electromagnetism

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:00.780 align:middle line:10%
creating a tube.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.410 align:middle line:10%
And within that tube,
there's a sound vibration.

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:middle line:10%
For most crop circles
that have appeared,

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.880 align:middle line:10%
there exists a corresponding
geometric image

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.340 align:middle line:10%
created by a sound frequency.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.930 align:middle line:10%
Back in the '50s
when a man called

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.810 align:middle line:10%
Hans Jenny was doing
exactly the same experiment,

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:18.120 align:middle line:10%
throwing sound at
sound and water,

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.890 align:middle line:10%
he would then film the results.

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:23.130 align:middle line:10%
And he built up a library
of geometric shapes created

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:24.660 align:middle line:10%
by sound.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Would you believe that someone
who is born in Portugal,

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
becomes British, emigrates to
America, lives in Portsmouth,

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
New Hampshire, ends up living
next to an American who

01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
ended up with a library of Hans
Jenny, who was a Swiss guy, who

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.275 align:middle line:90%
was doing cymatic experiments.

01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:41.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And they helped me to
validate the crop circles are

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
made by sound after
they'd mentioned

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
this in a psychic
communication 15 years earlier.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I love how this
stuff just works.

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:54.025 align:middle line:90%
So back to DNA.

01:05:54.025 --> 01:05:58.890 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
The shape of this
crop circle actually

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the central
components of the crop circle

01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:05.220 align:middle line:90%
is a rotating tube of energy.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's tightly packed
electric and magnetic spirals,

01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:12.298 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a light beam
enclosing a sonic element.

01:06:12.298 --> 01:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can see this
here in the laboratory,

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:16.200 align:middle line:90%
that they tried doing this.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is a ball
of light, of plasma,

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that's generated at
a high speed, frozen

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:23.700 align:middle line:90%
in a fraction of a second.

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And they've found that
while it's actually

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
creating the spiral motion,
they found that inside there's

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:31.500 align:middle line:90%
a sonic component.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
When they reversed
the process, they

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.910 align:middle line:84%
began to throw sounds
into a laboratory.

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And when sound reaches 40
octaves above the human hearing

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.910 align:middle line:84%
range, it created
a burst of light.

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenon called
sonoluminescence.

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the conversion of
sound into light frequency.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So sound and light are literally
essentially part and parcel

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:52.080 align:middle line:90%
of the same phenomenon.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you put these three
crop circles together,

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
they actually reveal how
the crop circles are made.

01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
You have essentially a
descending particle wave

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
of electricity, creating one
spiral, a magnetic particle

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:06.960 align:middle line:90%
wave creating the second spiral.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
You have-- inside this tube
is a longitudinal sound wave.

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And when that sound
wave hits the ground,

01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to disperse, you

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
have a shielding effect that
keeps it within the design.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.002 align:middle line:84%
And it's that four
degree magnetic shift

01:07:22.002 --> 01:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
that allows the
information to come

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
from upstairs to downstairs, and
you've got your geometric shape

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.200 align:middle line:90%
in the ground.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And these are the beams
that are essentially

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
envisioned by 80 eyewitnesses
around the world.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:35.610 align:middle line:90%
And here's a picture of it.

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Except when I took
this photograph--

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:38.110 align:middle line:90%
I hope you can see this.

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:39.540 align:middle line:90%
There's a beam here.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:42.110 align:middle line:84%
This is back in the days
when film was being used.

01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:42.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:44.210 align:middle line:90%
And there's a second beam.

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what
was happening there.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a professional
photographer by trade, as well.

01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting on a hill five
miles away, reading my notes,

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:54.660 align:middle line:90%
having a little picnic.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you get that
voice in your head that goes,

01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:58.950 align:middle line:90%
yeah, pick up the camera.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
My spirit guides are like
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:02.350 align:middle line:90%
They sound like them.

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:03.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:04.582 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, pick up the camera.

01:08:04.582 --> 01:08:05.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I don't
remember taking a picture of--

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see a beam of light.

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I took the picture
and I went, well,

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.760 align:middle line:90%
that was a stupid picture.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.990 align:middle line:90%
What a horrible event.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
2:00 in the afternoon, you
don't take pictures at 2:00

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.170 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
The landscape doesn't
look very good.

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I had it
developed, and I went, oh,

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.779 align:middle line:90%
what the hell is that?

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:25.279 align:middle line:84%
That looks like my
back of my camera

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:28.069 align:middle line:84%
has been fogged because that's
the first reaction when you see

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:29.952 align:middle line:84%
a picture shot with
film, the light

01:08:29.952 --> 01:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
has intruded from the
back of the camera.

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.830 align:middle line:90%
So I checked the negative.

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:33.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:34.970 align:middle line:90%
The negative is true.

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:37.430 align:middle line:90%
There's a top and the bottom.

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I've captured two
beams of light.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.540 align:middle line:90%
I sent it to Kodak.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's going on here?

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, as
quite obvious, duh.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
You've filmed sunlight.

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:48.170 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, no, no.

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:49.460 align:middle line:90%
2:00 in the afternoon.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.899 align:middle line:84%
There's the sun
at-- well, that's

01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:52.670 align:middle line:90%
the edge of the sun over there.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It's actually way,
way over here.

01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:56.939 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to photograph
beams coming from the sun,

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I would expect beams
coming this way.

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect them coming
downhill at 90 degrees.

01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Not the same thing.

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.702 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you got--
then you got-- you got UFOs.

01:09:05.702 --> 01:09:07.267 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well, maybe.

01:09:07.267 --> 01:09:08.689 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Now gets really weird.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
So I'm at the pub--

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.632 align:middle line:84%
sorry, the research
facility the next day.

01:09:13.632 --> 01:09:14.779 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And in England, you don't--

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
strangers don't usually
talk to each other

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.587 align:middle line:84%
unless they've been
formally introduced.

01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And I kept a low profile
when I was working there,

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
mostly because I hate
getting into arguments

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:27.394 align:middle line:90%
with people in pubs.

01:09:27.394 --> 01:09:29.575 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I like
to enjoy my drink.

01:09:29.575 --> 01:09:31.450 align:middle line:10%
And two because sometimes
people approach you

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:32.870 align:middle line:10%
with really interesting
information.

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:35.120 align:middle line:10%
And there's a woman there
that looked a bit perturbed.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.220 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, are you OK?

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.680 align:middle line:10%
She said, well, I need to talk
to someone about something

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680 align:middle line:10%
that happened yesterday.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah, sure.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.350 align:middle line:10%
Yesterday, I was taking
my dog for my afternoon

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:45.750 align:middle line:10%
constitutional--

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:46.919 align:middle line:10%
that means a walk.

01:09:46.919 --> 01:09:47.779 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:50.899 align:middle line:10%
My afternoon
constitutional and there

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:53.210 align:middle line:10%
was a sort of tube that
came out of the clouds.

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.590 align:middle line:10%
I went, what?

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.660 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it came down
on top of the wheat

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.090 align:middle line:10%
and it rotated the
wheat in 15 seconds,

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.920 align:middle line:10%
and then it rotated
back up again.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.820 align:middle line:10%
My dog was barking at it.

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And I was totally
flummoxed by this.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.910 align:middle line:10%
And I went there
for a walk today

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:08.910 align:middle line:10%
and there's a great big
crop circle right there.

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:10.325 align:middle line:10%
I went, in 15 seconds?

01:10:10.325 --> 01:10:11.450 align:middle line:10%
She said, yeah, absolutely.

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:13.880 align:middle line:10%
I said, OK, well, that's
pretty consistent with what

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.040 align:middle line:10%
I've heard so far.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.000 align:middle line:10%
And I pulled out the--

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.130 align:middle line:10%
I said, what time of
the afternoon was this?

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, about 2 o'clock
in the afternoon.

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled out the picture
with a time stamp, 2 o'clock

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:23.930 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:25.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's towards
[INAUDIBLE] right there.

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:26.770 align:middle line:90%
That's where you were walking.

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's exactly
where I was walking.

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So I filmed what this woman
actually saw in real life.

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't make this stuff up.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful moment
for her, I believe.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Here's what she actually saw.

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:40.562 align:middle line:10%
I mean, absolutely beautiful.

01:10:40.562 --> 01:10:41.770 align:middle line:10%
In fact, that's us measuring.

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.400 align:middle line:10%
We're actually doing
work there, for a change.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.200 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.580 align:middle line:10%
That's us measuring.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.220 align:middle line:10%
In fact, these things actually
go back all the way to--

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.710 align:middle line:10%
well, they go back
to the 1680s, 1920s.

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was a moment
when a farmer in Kent

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:58.130 align:middle line:84%
in England, he was out looking
at his crop in the middle

01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:00.350 align:middle line:90%
of a bit of a rain.

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The rain tends to happen in
England fairly frequently.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.238 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:04.238 --> 01:11:05.090 align:middle line:10%


01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:08.530 align:middle line:10%
He was out there in
1965, and he sort of

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.250 align:middle line:10%
was just checking his
barley or whatever.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:13.640 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, he said, this
tube just came out of the sky,

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.700 align:middle line:10%
rotated the crop in front
of him about 50 yards away,

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.300 align:middle line:10%
and then it went back up
again in 15 seconds, flattened

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.780 align:middle line:10%
the crop like a
pancake, he said.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.100 align:middle line:10%
And says, I know I
wasn't making this up.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.630 align:middle line:10%
I could see the rain bouncing
off the edges of this tube.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:28.080 align:middle line:10%
Farmers don't talk like that.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.150 align:middle line:10%
They really don't.

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:31.790 align:middle line:10%
And there's been many
very rare occurrences

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:34.400 align:middle line:10%
when things have happened
to innocent people

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.750 align:middle line:10%
in broad daylight.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.360 align:middle line:10%
This is very famous from 1997.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.910 align:middle line:10%
4 o'clock in the
afternoon, a pilot

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:43.550 align:middle line:10%
is requesting permission
from the local airfield--

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:46.760 align:middle line:10%
it's a military airfield--
permission to land.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.120 align:middle line:10%
And they pass just around
here, next to Stonehenge.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.470 align:middle line:10%
They don't report anything.

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:52.590 align:middle line:10%
Permission to land.

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:53.690 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely granted.

01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And it lands.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.610 align:middle line:10%
15 minutes later, a Cessna
comes by with a doctor on board,

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.800 align:middle line:10%
says, we'd like to--
permission to land.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.457 align:middle line:10%
What the hell is that?

01:12:02.457 --> 01:12:03.740 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.540 align:middle line:10%
That actually was
the conversation.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And they-- you
know, in 15 minutes,

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.780 align:middle line:10%
someone had created
a 149 circle spiral.

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Every 15 minutes, the guards who
go around Stonehenge up here--

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
one of the world's
most visited monuments,

01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:19.080 align:middle line:90%
with hundreds of people--

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
they go around checking
from a higher vantage point,

01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:23.658 align:middle line:90%
has anybody jumped the fence?

01:12:23.658 --> 01:12:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And trying to get in
without paying the Queen her

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.270 align:middle line:90%
rightful 10 pounds?

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:28.070 align:middle line:10%
Nothing.

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:29.025 align:middle line:10%
They go by at 4:15.

01:12:29.025 --> 01:12:30.650 align:middle line:10%
They look down into
the field, and they

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.360 align:middle line:10%
go, what the hell is that?

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.240 align:middle line:10%
Here, and because this
only happens in England,

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.850 align:middle line:10%
this is the major
highway in England.

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:39.160 align:middle line:10%
One lane going that way.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160 align:middle line:10%
One lane going this way.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.480 align:middle line:10%
That's a major highway.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.280 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.490 align:middle line:10%
Some guy in a taxi
sees a tube of light

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:48.410 align:middle line:10%
at 4:15 in the afternoon,
coming down into the field,

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:51.060 align:middle line:10%
creating a massive vapor column.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:51.860 align:middle line:10%
Freaked him out.

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.580 align:middle line:10%
Slams on his brakes.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.730 align:middle line:10%
Stands in front of
the hood of this car.

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.000 align:middle line:10%
If you're English, that's
called a bonnet, just

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.040 align:middle line:10%
in case this is going
out internationally.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.740 align:middle line:10%
Stands on the bonnet of his
car and basically goes, wow.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.240 align:middle line:10%
And we know he
wasn't making this up

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.730 align:middle line:10%
because he caused a 15 mile
tail back on that one lane.

01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:12.980 align:middle line:10%
So he actually saw the
actual thing happening.

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:16.010 align:middle line:10%
And, again, 15 seconds or less.

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:19.210 align:middle line:10%
So the question is, why this
is tend to happen to, you know,

01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:20.110 align:middle line:10%
southern Britain?

01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:22.840 align:middle line:10%
You know, 80% of the world's
registered crop circles

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.260 align:middle line:10%
appear in this particular
small part of Britain.

01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, it happens along
a degree of latitude,

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
which is about 51 degrees,
which if you're into the bigger

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
scheme of things,
is the slope angle

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.530 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:37.120 align:middle line:90%
There is a relationship--

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.872 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go into that some
other time, another lecture.

01:13:39.872 --> 01:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
One reason, of
course, is the water

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and the chalk of which this
region is predominant built on.

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, there's a high
concentration of sacred sites

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:49.570 align:middle line:90%
and energy lines there already.

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
For me, the most
important reason

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.295 align:middle line:84%
is that they're doing
it because of this.

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:55.720 align:middle line:90%


01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.413 align:middle line:90%
The best beer in the world.

01:13:57.413 --> 01:13:58.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But once we began to
make the connection,

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
we began to realize
that there are--

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
the greatest concentrations
of crop circles

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
occur in the general area
around Avery and Stonehenge,

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
in this one area of
about 400 square miles.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
When we actually look
at this particular area,

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and you put down on this
map the telluric currents,

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the Earth's
electromagnetic currents,

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and plot them, you then
superimpose the position

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:27.520 align:middle line:84%
of the existing stone
circles, standing stones

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.450 align:middle line:90%
and other temples.

01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:29.860 align:middle line:90%
You get these little dots.

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.530 align:middle line:84%
You can see how they
reference the energy lines.

01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.170 align:middle line:10%
But when you plot the real
crop circles and the temples,

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.560 align:middle line:10%
look at the relationship.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
They're all occurring on
the same lines of energy.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So, obviously, there's a
relationship going on here.

01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So we figured, what if the
phenomenon is conscious?

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
What if you can actually
communicate with it?

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the early
guided experiments,

01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:53.320 align:middle line:84%
we got together with
astrophysicists,

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
mathematicians,
psychics, engineers,

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
laypeople, and we paid
the farmer and we said,

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
we're going to make a
crop circle according

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to certain geometric and
mathematical principles,

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.845 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
meditate, and we're

01:15:06.845 --> 01:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
going to connect with
the circle makers

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
in a guided, scientific,
closed experiment.

01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:13.397 align:middle line:90%
And the farmer said--

01:15:13.397 --> 01:15:14.230 align:middle line:90%
he just walked away.

01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:15.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Just pay me 200 pounds.

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Off he goes.

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:20.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is what happened.

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.780 align:middle line:90%
The design over here.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.340 align:middle line:90%


01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It was actually created
as the most possible

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
geometric mathematical
expression

01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:31.630 align:middle line:90%
of a piece of communication.

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Mathematics and geometry
are the language of nature.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So if an extraterrestrial
force is doing this,

01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:38.800 align:middle line:84%
they would understand
what we were doing.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
The trick is, we weren't just
going to do any old diameter.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:44.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make the
diameter of the design

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
according to the most famous
unit of measure, which

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.770 align:middle line:84%
is called a megalithic yard,
which few people know about.

01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the unit
of measure that was

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
used to make all the ancient
temples around the world.

01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's very specific
because it measures 2.72 feet.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.180 align:middle line:90%
There's your megalitihic yard.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's derived from
the measurement--

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
the surface ratio of the
tetrahedron and the sphere,

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.617 align:middle line:84%
which are the two building
blocks of the universe.

01:16:09.617 --> 01:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
exists in the universe

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
is based on those
two building blocks.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.160 align:middle line:90%
How the hell do they know?

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Another story.

01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
they meditated on this.

01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
The intent was to connect
with the circle making force

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:23.260 align:middle line:90%
and hopefully elicit a response.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Would you believe that
two weeks later that's

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.690 align:middle line:90%
exactly what happened?

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:28.840 align:middle line:84%
They took the balls
on the outside

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and they put them
inside the triangle.

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it was true,
because the diameter that they

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.880 align:middle line:84%
created it, was exactly 100
times the megalithic yard,

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
literally down to
the decimal point.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
We thought, wow,
what a great feeling,

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that you connected with this
extraterrestrial consciousness.

01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:50.080 align:middle line:90%
So we got a bit sort of--

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
well, I wouldn't say
cocky, but confident,

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that let's see what's
happening because there's

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
a lesson each season.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.045 align:middle line:84%
So by 1999, I'm getting
a bit confident.

01:16:58.045 --> 01:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, what if
we can predict where they're

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
going to be for this year?

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So in 1999, I
conducted an experiment

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.770 align:middle line:84%
across both sides
of the Atlantic,

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
where I asked mathematicians,
computer experts, psychics,

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
one layperson, just for fun,
and then I would tell them,

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell me where
the big one of the season

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.680 align:middle line:90%
is going to be.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell me
where it's going to be.

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Around about what time?

01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:25.420 align:middle line:90%
In terms of day.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.617 align:middle line:84%
And also, if possible, what
is it going to look like?

01:17:28.617 --> 01:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And would you believe-- and
this is a closed experiment.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't know the
answers to this.

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Only I know the answers.

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And all the responses that
I got were exactly the same,

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:38.680 align:middle line:90%
or pretty much the same.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.680 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be around
this town of Devizes

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.300 align:middle line:90%
in Wiltshire in England.

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be around
this particular day,

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're all within
48 hours of each other.

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to feel
like a nine point--

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.820 align:middle line:84%
well, it's going to look
like a seven pointed star,

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
but we are also getting
a sense of nine.

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:54.390 align:middle line:90%


01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
good enough for me.

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So I put that in
a sealed envelope.

01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we began to
work with local psychics

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
to figure out pretty much,
you know, what kind of time

01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:06.680 align:middle line:90%
we would do it.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if we
figured out the time,

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
we could catch
them at it finally.

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And we got it down
to within 24 hours.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
be in that field,

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
within this particular
day, in the morning.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.890 align:middle line:90%
So I figured, OK.

01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call my pilot.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.747 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
without telling him

01:18:21.747 --> 01:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
where we're going,
we are going to say,

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
right, Tony, I want you
to book me this Microlight

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to fly at this airfield
at 8 in the morning.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not telling
you where we're going.

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
It's an experiment
and you're part of it.

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.287 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thanks a lot.

01:18:34.287 --> 01:18:35.480 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.920 align:middle line:10%
Real skeptic.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's all.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:42.592 align:middle line:10%
So we got together in
my humble little straw--

01:18:42.592 --> 01:18:45.050 align:middle line:10%
actually, that's not a straw
built cottage, a thatched roof

01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:46.220 align:middle line:10%
cottage.

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:50.870 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, we'll prepare
with blankets, and gallons

01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:52.160 align:middle line:10%
of brandy because it gets--

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.070 align:middle line:10%
it really does get really,
really damp and cold in England

01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:58.370 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the summer at
night, night vision equipment,

01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:01.470 align:middle line:10%
and other Russian things that
they smuggled across the Iron

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.270 align:middle line:10%
Curtain.

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:05.150 align:middle line:10%
We figured we finally
going to catch them at it.

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:08.300 align:middle line:10%
We've got a high vantage point
over the field in question.

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.040 align:middle line:10%
We're finally going to do it.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.610 align:middle line:10%
11:30 comes around, and
it's like someone just

01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.957 align:middle line:10%
put a pallet of sleeping
gas into my living room.

01:19:15.957 --> 01:19:17.540 align:middle line:10%
And all I remember
is people just kind

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.520 align:middle line:10%
of dozing off, and
just falling over.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.433 align:middle line:10%
And I'm one of them.

01:19:20.433 --> 01:19:22.850 align:middle line:10%
And I remember a good friend
of mine who's no longer here,

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:25.190 align:middle line:10%
she's going, come on,
we've got to go, Freddy.

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:25.990 align:middle line:10%
Drive the car.

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.870 align:middle line:10%
We've got to get out of here.

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:27.470 align:middle line:10%
I said, oh, god.

01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:29.210 align:middle line:10%
It's like someone
just sat on my head.

01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:31.301 align:middle line:10%
I feel really, really tired.

01:19:31.301 --> 01:19:33.176 align:middle line:10%
Next thing I remember,
it's 7 in the morning.

01:19:33.176 --> 01:19:36.350 align:middle line:10%
And I suddenly woke up with
a jolt. And I thought--

01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:38.400 align:middle line:10%
I won't explain
what I said then.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.200 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.475 align:middle line:10%
And everybody's still asleep.

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.350 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, I'm not
going to disturb them.

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.570 align:middle line:10%
Got in my car, drove
like a European--

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:47.630 align:middle line:10%
which is about 90 miles per hour
in a 20 miles per hour zone.

01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:48.530 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:49.640 align:middle line:10%
And drove to the airfield.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.300 align:middle line:10%
Covered in fog.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.540 align:middle line:10%
Tony is there, going,
you're not thinking

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:54.830 align:middle line:10%
you're flying out in this.

01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:57.860 align:middle line:10%
I said, yes, we're going
to this particular field

01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.255 align:middle line:10%
next to Devizes.

01:19:59.255 --> 01:20:02.690 align:middle line:10%
He said, are you looking
for a crop circle?

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:03.680 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.640 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing there.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.450 align:middle line:10%
Not in that area.

01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:06.630 align:middle line:10%
I was the last pilot.

01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:09.870 align:middle line:10%
No one's going to make a crop
circle in that short of time.

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.390 align:middle line:10%
Well, maybe.

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:12.260 align:middle line:10%
Just humor me.

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:12.590 align:middle line:10%
All right.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.340 align:middle line:10%
It's foggy.

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:14.460 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be flying around.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.835 align:middle line:10%
It's going to cost
you a fortune.

01:20:15.835 --> 01:20:16.890 align:middle line:10%
Eh, OK.

01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:18.150 align:middle line:10%
So we flew around.

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:20.210 align:middle line:10%
There's a bit of
the fog right there.

01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:21.440 align:middle line:10%
Banks of fog everywhere.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:24.720 align:middle line:10%
And the clock is ticking and
my money is leaving my wallet.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.520 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.545 align:middle line:10%
And we're going around,
and around, and around.

01:20:27.545 --> 01:20:28.920 align:middle line:10%
And, you know,
it's a Microlight.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.003 align:middle line:10%
It's a big flying
gas tank basically.

01:20:32.003 --> 01:20:33.670 align:middle line:10%
And he's in front of
me with his helmet.

01:20:33.670 --> 01:20:35.180 align:middle line:10%
And I've got my helmet.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's going around.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.110 align:middle line:10%
And, suddenly,
they-- it just parts.

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:40.760 align:middle line:10%
This fog just parts.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we saw.

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.506 align:middle line:10%
And all I heard was--

01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:47.970 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:48.950 align:middle line:10%


01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.060 align:middle line:10%
How did you know?

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.050 align:middle line:10%
I said, you don't want to know.

01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:54.930 align:middle line:10%
And there we have it--
seven pointed star, twice.

01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:56.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a seven pointed thing.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And there is an nine
pointed geometric element

01:20:59.210 --> 01:21:00.530 align:middle line:90%
that you can't see here.

01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's created by the area
where the crop was literally

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
turned around 180 degrees and
reversed course on itself.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.000 align:middle line:10%
So they were right.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.458 align:middle line:10%
There was a seven
pointed geometry,

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:11.100 align:middle line:10%
and a nine in there somewhere.

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.825 align:middle line:10%
They were all absolutely right.

01:21:12.825 --> 01:21:15.200 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was-- and we got
the information afterwards.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.810 align:middle line:10%
I ran back-- well, I
drove back to the house.

01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:19.250 align:middle line:10%
Everybody had got up.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:21.770 align:middle line:10%
And they said,
right, was it there?

01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:23.570 align:middle line:10%
You won't believe what
we just discovered.

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:24.980 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe we missed this.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.350 align:middle line:10%
And one of my friends, again,
a very good psychic, she

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.830 align:middle line:10%
says, well, I was told the
reason why they stopped us

01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:31.580 align:middle line:10%
from going last night
is because they just

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:35.570 align:middle line:10%
laid down the most
potent crop circle ever.

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
If we'd been anywhere
there within the vicinity,

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
we would have been
absolutely fried.

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:43.820 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, I get a phone
call from a friend of mine.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And he goes-- he phones
me up and he says,

01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing about
3/4 of a mile away.

01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:52.130 align:middle line:90%
I've gone as close as I can.

01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
16 packs of batteries
just went dead.

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:55.398 align:middle line:90%
Don't go near this thing.

01:21:55.398 --> 01:21:56.690 align:middle line:90%
The readings are off the scale.

01:21:56.690 --> 01:21:59.670 align:middle line:84%
He just validated what
the psychic just said.

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So they said, we wanted
to let you know that you

01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:02.790 align:middle line:90%
can communicate with us.

01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the crop
circles are not meant for you.

01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:07.760 align:middle line:84%
They're meant for something
else, like the Earth.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So if it tell-- if it says
to you, don't come close,

01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:12.425 align:middle line:90%
don't do it.

01:22:12.425 --> 01:22:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That's your way of knowing.

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:17.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't feel well,
it's not meant for you.

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was impressive
until we came across this one.

01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just minding
my own business,

01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:25.622 align:middle line:84%
flying over the crop circle,
taking aerial photographs.

01:22:25.622 --> 01:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And what should have been
a nice strip of photographs

01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:31.160 align:middle line:84%
right over the crop circle
complete black frames.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Nine black frames and this
rainbow picture in the middle.

01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain that
as a photographer.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And then the camera dies.

01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:41.070 align:middle line:90%
If you can just squint--

01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.870 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to see.

01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:45.690 align:middle line:84%
If you can just squint, you
can see a face in there.

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I went to the channeling
session with my good friend

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
who was doing the work with
the crop circle makers.

01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said during question
and answer time, I said,

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
what have I actually
captured here?

01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.450 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't say anything else.

01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:01.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, what you've
actually captured, my friend,

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is a picture of a
Shining One, a Watcher.

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
What the Hopi and the
Zuni called a Looker.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
know, you humans

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
don't want to believe
that you're getting help

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:15.510 align:middle line:90%
from other sources.

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we have to make
things very, very blatant

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.000 align:middle line:90%
for you.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately the
way we do things

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.950 align:middle line:90%
fries your little black boxes.

01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Refer to my Nikon
that no longer works.

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.340 align:middle line:90%
And they were absolutely right.

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.960 align:middle line:84%
But they also said
that, you know,

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
often we lower our
operating frequency

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to a point where you
can actually see us

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.580 align:middle line:90%
in your level of reality.

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.790 align:middle line:10%
And you see us as
brightly colored orbs.

01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Here's one film that was
shot by eyewitnesses.

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Here's the orb.

01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:46.880 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I've slowed this down
to 20%, by the way.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.820 align:middle line:84%
This is-- this is real thing,
not like the fake stuff that's

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
going on the internet of
orbs making crop circles.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That's a complete
fake film, by the way.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's in my book.

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.460 align:middle line:90%
But there it goes.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Again, 20% of speed.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.667 align:middle line:90%
It's flying very, very fast.

01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:07.250 align:middle line:84%
The cameraman is having a hard
time trying to keep up with it.

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:10.450 align:middle line:90%


01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:12.090 align:middle line:84%
We know it's a real
one because it's

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:15.660 align:middle line:84%
about to reach a closed
off military installation

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and all the helicopters
took off because they

01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
thought they were being attacked
by an unknown flying object.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:21.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.320 align:middle line:90%
That's how we know.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:29.160 align:middle line:84%
The barracks are about to
come into focus right here.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:35.092 align:middle line:90%


01:24:35.092 --> 01:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
There's the secret
military installation.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.670 align:middle line:90%
I can't show you anymore.

01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:38.716 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to kill you.

01:24:38.716 --> 01:24:40.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I was just minding
my own business.

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Looking at this.

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it from here,
what's happening here.

01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:47.810 align:middle line:90%
There's one.

01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:49.430 align:middle line:90%
And there's another one.

01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:52.245 align:middle line:84%
I had to slow that
down quite a lot.

01:24:52.245 --> 01:24:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Sorry these are not
very great quality.

01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
These were shot with
very old cameras.

01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:58.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to circle it.

01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there it is,
flying over the field.

01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They look like bright
pearls in the daylight.

01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
In the evening, the color is
of a description I can't--

01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I have no words for.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.048 align:middle line:84%
The luminescence
is extraordinary.

01:25:13.048 --> 01:25:14.090 align:middle line:90%
They're very mischievous.

01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:15.445 align:middle line:90%
They have a sense of humor.

01:25:15.445 --> 01:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
They tend to tell
us, well, we're

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.840 align:middle line:84%
going to be appearing at
this particular hot spot.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go out there and
go, well, look at them.

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll appear behind us
when we're doing a night watch.

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Just to sort of
keep us guessing.

01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Very, very mischievous.

01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
The evidence links the orbs as
an expression of consciousness

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that is made visible
with the crop circles.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not actual UFOs.

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.890 align:middle line:90%
They're not physical at all.

01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
They have been contacting
gifted, sensitive, even

01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
tribal wisdom keepers
for at least 40 years

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:45.265 align:middle line:84%
before the phenomenon
really began to appear.

01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And what the
watchers were saying

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.180 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going to appear at
the base of your hill of light

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.500 align:middle line:90%
in seven days time.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%
They told this to
my psychic friend.

01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And she had no idea what
the hell was going on.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The hill of light
refers to Silbury Hill.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what it actually means.

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:01.462 align:middle line:84%
It means the hill of the
Shining Ones, or the Watchers,

01:26:01.462 --> 01:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
by any other name.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
series of crop circles.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we realized
That the communication was

01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:08.810 align:middle line:90%
absolutely real.

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And the stated purpose
that they were saying

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
was that they're here to encode
energy forms at pressure points

01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:16.790 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth that
will help humanity

01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:19.460 align:middle line:84%
evolve during this
evolutionary period.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.310 align:middle line:90%
That's verbatim communication.

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
They also stated that
they have incarnated here

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.140 align:middle line:84%
on Earth at pivotal periods
in early human history.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But they always found
it difficult to be

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:31.680 align:middle line:90%
in physical form.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.120 align:middle line:10%
So the Watchers developed
appropriate physical bodies.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.533 align:middle line:10%
And they're saying, we were
the tall ones in your cultures.

01:26:38.533 --> 01:26:39.950 align:middle line:10%
And we are the
ones who are buried

01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:41.390 align:middle line:10%
in the giant's graves,
which you still

01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:43.812 align:middle line:10%
find throughout northern Europe
in Britain and in Ireland.

01:26:43.812 --> 01:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And they are actually
still called giant graves

01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:47.420 align:middle line:90%
to this very, very day.

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And because in all nature,
form follows function,

01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
they also had to
develop unusual heads.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They said that we had to
develop the cranium at the back.

01:26:57.950 --> 01:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
We had to have a more
developed spiritual brain.

01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
had a long heads.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Humans require a
bigger frontal dome

01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
process information.

01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And they're absolutely right.

01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And to this very day,
the back of the brain

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:14.210 align:middle line:90%
is still the most mysterious.

01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness of
this planet, they say,

01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:17.960 align:middle line:90%
has hit a critical mass.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And the crop circles
are an expression

01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:21.630 align:middle line:90%
of that consciousness.

01:27:21.630 --> 01:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It is a co-creative
interaction between us

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and several
interdimensional realities.

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And these entities
are always here.

01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They're just not in
physical form anymore.

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So we are getting an expression
of these dimensions in the crop

01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:36.470 align:middle line:90%
circles.

01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And each design is an expression
of a different interplanetary

01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:43.340 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, just like
we have a myriad of races

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.420 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So what do the Watchers want?

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to close
off today's presentation

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
with part of the directed
channel communication

01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:53.250 align:middle line:84%
because they say it so
much better than I can.

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:55.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is what they said.

01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Within the energy
pattern of the circles,

01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:58.910 align:middle line:90%
we give you information.

01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
You humans do not believe
your dreams and inspirations,

01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
so other methods
have to be used.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.620 align:middle line:84%
This will happen by
the right people being

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:09.010 align:middle line:90%
drawn into the understanding.

01:28:09.010 --> 01:28:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Amidst all its
struggles, humanity

01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
does not seem to want to
accept that love, great--

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
it's always against
me every single time.

01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:19.580 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful.

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is not one to accept
that love, great and powerful,

01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:25.370 align:middle line:84%
is encircling the world
and being transmitted.

01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It is most essential to
create the right atmosphere

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.600 align:middle line:84%
for enlightenment into the
grid system of your planet.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Those who bring
knowledge are here again.

01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We are known as Watchers because
we can only aid and help.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Your Earth cries
with tears, and we

01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
feel the pain and sorrow of
humanity's misunderstandings.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.520 align:middle line:84%
We have not the will
to change the world.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.210 align:middle line:90%
This, my friends, is your work.

01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So do not always look
upward, for there

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.410 align:middle line:90%
is much to love below.

01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:58.520 align:middle line:10%
And for the rest of this very,
very complex and fascinating

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.870 align:middle line:10%
story, have I got
some books for you.

01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:01.670 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:02.900 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very much.

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.000 align:middle line:10%
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.400 align:middle line:90%


01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.900 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:19.400 align:middle line:10%
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
 CONTINUES]

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.450 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:37.110 align:middle line:90%
