00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:04.750 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: On this planet
of six billion people,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.900 align:middle line:90%
there are six billion stories.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.370 align:middle line:90%
This is one of them.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It's about one man's life.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.800 align:middle line:84%
It's about UFOs,
which he has filmed

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%
in the high heavens
and ETs and orbs

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and the gods who
created humanity.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:10%
It's a true story about
a man who has come back

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:10%
from the dead to a planet that
is undergoing dramatic Earth

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:10%
changes that will
affect all of us

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:10%
much sooner than we
might care to admit.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:10%
It is one story among
six billion stories.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.544 align:middle line:90%
It is James Gilliland's story.

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:38.771 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.753 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:43.430 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Two
ships coming out.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.841 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: I got them both.

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
they're both powered up.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: They're
both powered up.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Holy smokes, I got both
of them powering up.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.696 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:54.811 align:middle line:84%
Got 'em.
Got 'em.

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:56.696 align:middle line:84%
Two ships.
A double powering up.

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.064 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:58.064 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, as far as the
skeptics, I find it really

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:10%
humorous basically because
I've had so many experiences

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:10%
there is no doubt
in my mind that this

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:10%
is a real event going on.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:10%
And the evidence that we
have here is overwhelming.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: I
got them on film.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I got the laser too.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.264 align:middle line:84%
The laser is showing
up on the film.

00:01:18.264 --> 00:01:19.707 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Now it's moving.

00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:20.661 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Dang.

00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Blanket
with the laser.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.082 align:middle line:90%
Like three and then two.

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: What we are seeing
against a backdrop of space

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
itself is UFO footage shot
over a period of years

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
by James Gilliland,
a man who's built

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
a sanctuary near Mount Adams
in the state of Washington.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
James has experienced
contact with ETs,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
off worlders from other
galaxies and dimensions.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But he's not the only one to
wonder about these visitors

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:90%
from elsewhere.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The main thing is we
have professional people

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
that are air traffic
controllers, pilots.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They know what
they're looking at.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And Air Force.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We've had Air Force
Base commanders here.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the ships that we
filmed is just beautiful

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and it comes in and it's
actually pink in the middle.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Has blue on the
outside, turquoise

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:90%
at the top and the bottom.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
You see these rotating
fields on the ship

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.932 align:middle line:90%
and it's pulsing like a heart.

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: I got him.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: I don't have him.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: I got him.
I got him.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Check him out, man.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:90%
He's going.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:84%
You should see the
field around this guy.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:90%
I've got him all the way.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.638 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.638 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Come on, light her up.
Do something.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Every time
I zoom in, I lose it.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, look it.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:90%
He's pulsing now.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
UFO on this camera.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And the physicists I had
a look at this, they said,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:90%
we have no idea what that is.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
That's-- they said,
all we can say is

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:84%
there's extremely high
technology involved

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:90%
in this and electronics.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's operating in some
kind of a light spectrum.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's beyond
anything that we have.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
experiences that I've had

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
have helped me to understand
the true nature of man, which

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
is in truth the
multidimensional being existing

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:90%
on a vibrational continuum.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And almost all the
physicists believe right now

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that we can measure and
experience less than 1%

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:90%
of the universe that we live in.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.370 align:middle line:90%
There's another 99% out there.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
They also know, according
to latest superstring theory

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and things of that
nature, that there's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
at least 11 dimensions out
there beyond this dimension.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And you look at all
the diversity of life

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
in just this dimension alone and
add 10 more dimensions to that.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine
what's out there.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
this physical universe

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
we're in with 200 billion
suns with planets revolving

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
around them, and now they
know there's at least 500

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
billion galaxies out there
with the same effect,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
whole new galaxies and universes
are being created daily.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:90%
The creation is ongoing.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying
according to this science

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
that we know today, the
science is there to explain

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
all of these events
and my experiences

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:90%
fit within that science.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But if people just
believe they're

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.052 align:middle line:84%
a body and a personality,
that's their reality.

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: In 1947
over Mount Rainer,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
Washington, pilot Kenneth Arnold
saw a group of flying saucers.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:84%
Since then the
Washington Cascades

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.223 align:middle line:90%
have changed dramatically.

00:04:21.223 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
The eruption of Mount
Saint Helens in 1980

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
killed scores of people and
changed the landscape forever.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:90%
It's now a tourist attraction.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Nearby Mount Adams, where those
flying saucers disappeared,

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
is still a focal
point of UFO activity.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:84%
James was drawn there after
near death experiences,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:90%
contact, and abductions.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The beings that we were
connecting with were Nordic.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:90%
More Nordic looking.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Very advanced.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was more
than one group.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones that were
initiating the experience,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:90%
but there's others involved too.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I was here at the
ranch for 10 years

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
doing the intense spiritual
practices and the meditation

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
work and assisting others
in process oriented work

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and inner sensitivity training.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was
in deep meditation

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and I started hearing
communication,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:90%
a transmission in my head.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
beautiful transmission

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
about the awakening and healing
of humanity and the Earth

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and how we have to rise
up in consciousness

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and start living in harmony
with each other and the planet

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and end the competition and
the greed and the separation.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
beautiful message.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, where
is this coming from?

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And-- because there's many,
many levels of consciousness

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
that we can attune to with
beings all along those levels.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said-- they said,
we're actually coming from fifth

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and sixth dimension is
what we're working in.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.926 align:middle line:84%
And they said, but in truth
we're coming from a ship.

00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:53.681 align:middle line:84%
And-- and that was
when I said, OK.

00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm done.
My imagination has run amok.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I quit.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go out
and plant some trees.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I need to get grounded
here because this

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:90%
is getting too weird.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even make
it to the front door

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.517 align:middle line:84%
when my two sisters came
up banging on the door.

00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And said, did you see it?
Did you see it?

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And I said, see what?

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there
was a ship hovering

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
right over the sanctuary here.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
first communication

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.265 align:middle line:84%
I had where I had to incorporate
the ships with my spirituality.

00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: It's been at least
a 20 year project for James

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Gilliland to land to build
his way up from bare dirt

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to the point that
he had at least

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
the shell of a conference hall
established on a sanctuary.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And although he's had
help from some quarters,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:84%
he's had to deal with
opposition from others.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But the dream has
kept him going.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And by mid-2006, he was ready
to stage the Science, Spirit,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and Well Transformation
Conference that would include

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
speakers who would
throw a bright light

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:84%
on the true history of humanity,
the art of diplomacy with ETs,

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
coming earth changes, and
explain what orbs are.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:10%
It was a conference
for open minds

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:10%
and important questions
that attracted people

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:10%
from throughout
the United States

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:10%
and overseas, all
interested in contact

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:10%
and important questions
like, where did we come from

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:10%
and why are we here?

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Many believe life itself
arose on Earth exclusively

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and that somehow
it's man's destiny

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to populate the vast and
empty reaches of space.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But ancient texts and
legends and teachers

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
tell of a different history,
a past in which very advanced

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
civilizations visited Earth,
terraformed the planet, created

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
humans through
genetic engineering,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:84%
then left to allow us to
evolve at our own pace.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:10%
In the Biblical manuscripts,
the stories of the creation

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.225 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, the
ancient occupants,

00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:10%
the nephalem, the giants, are
just scattered here and there.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:10%
In the Zohar, in the Kabbalah,
they are replete with them.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
They were not sterilized
from these records.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And what the
exopolitics model holds

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
is that we live in a highly
populated universe populated

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:07.225 align:middle line:84%
by intelligent, evolving
civilizations operating

00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
under universe law with some
form of governance systems

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:90%
mediated by universe politics.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And we here on Earth are just
now becoming aware of this.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:10%
Historically, in
conflicts, in wars,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:10%
what one side-- typically
what both sides do

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:10%
is that they depict
the other side using

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:10%
the stereotypes of the enemy.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:10%
And so you create an enemy.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:90%
You stereotype them.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Typically you motivate people
to go out and kill those

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
by inculcating them

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:84%
with this very
deep indoctrination

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:90%
of them being the enemy.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Orbs are many different things.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:10%
They're nonphysical beings.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:10%
They're coming from a higher
dimension than we are.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle line:10%
When we die, we leave the body.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:10%
We move up through the
spine, we come on out

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:10%
and we blast on out
as a light spear.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:90%
And we become an orb.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So some of these orbs
are disincarnate beings.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Some orbs are ultra
dimensional beings coming

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:90%
from a much higher frequency.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Some of the orbs
are nature spirits.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Now I've been here 20 years
doing intense spiritual work

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and practices and meditation and
anchoring the energy in here.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And-- which, is what opened
the door to the ET connections.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
They have a technology
to actually--

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:84%
they can take you out
of bed physically,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.873 align:middle line:84%
put you on the ship, and-- and
they put you right back in bed.

00:09:39.873 --> 00:09:42.663 align:middle line:84%
But it's is so vivid
what happened is--

00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
is that you would--you
would think it was a dream.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:90%
I had a golden ball of energy.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in the
bathtub at the time.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'm really
tired of all this high

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
flying activity
and the power ups

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
and the turns and everything.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's all
great but what the heck

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:90%
is my involvement here?

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Why am I involved in this?

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.237 align:middle line:90%
I really want to know.

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, I
don't care if this kills me.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I need to know the
answer to this.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Three gold balls of energy come
down and hit me in the chest.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
know I'm on the ship,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:84%
standing there talking
to this beautiful being.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And her name is Melia
and she's from the Orion

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Council of Light.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:10%
And they have these huge
golden plasma ships which we've

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:10%
filmed over the center here.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:90%
And they're very ancient.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at her,
I could see all races

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:90%
combined in one person.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I asked her was
what the headdress was about.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Because she had like a bathing
cap type thing with gold bars

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:90%
suspended above it.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And she said this
is a spiritual form

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of technology we use to initiate
people, to wake people up.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have incarnated

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth for these times
and-- and we're initiating

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:90%
them, waking them up.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked her what the
three gold balls of energy

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, all
of your memories

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:90%
have been returned to you.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And after that experience,
I had full knowledge

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
of all of my past lives, as
well as off world existences

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.610 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I said to her
was, I want physical proof

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:90%
that this is just not a dream.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.022 align:middle line:84%
And she said you have
all the proof you need.

00:11:16.022 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Next thing, boom, I was
back in the bath tub.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I got up out of the bathtub
and I looked in the mirror

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and I had this big burn mark
in the middle of my chest

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:90%
where the beam hit me.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And we actually took
photographs of it, you know.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:90%
And there was no pain involved.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It looked painful.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.835 align:middle line:84%
There was no pain
involved in it at all.

00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:36.555 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't deny the event
because every time I got out

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
of the bath tub or looked in the
mirror I had this big red burn

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:90%
mark in the middle of my chest.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say the main
question that should have been

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:90%
asked is, why are they here?

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Not do they exist?

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Are they real?

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is overwhelming
that they are here.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And we all know they're here.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The government
knows they're here.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
All the governments
know they're here

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and the masses of the people
know that they're here.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
No, let's take it
to the next step.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.826 align:middle line:84%
And there's different groups
with different agendas.

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:09.406 align:middle line:90%

a new series of atomic

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Tanks are among

equipment being tested
in the exercises,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:90%
called Operation Teapot.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
More than 9,000 servicemen
have been assembled

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
at the proving grounds,
ready to take their places

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:90%

Quickly, the men are ordered
to leave their positions.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
The explosion's radioactive
fallout is almost as

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:90%
dangerous as the blast itself.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Nuclear
test programs, which

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
began in the Second
World War, have

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:90%
been closely monitored by UFOs.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
They've been taking a close
interest because these weapons

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
could potentially annihilate
all life on Earth,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.322 align:middle line:84%
but also seriously impact
other dimensions as well.

00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Yet even though many
pilots and astronauts

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.940 align:middle line:84%
have had personal encounters,
not to mention former President

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Carter, all of
this is officially denied

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:90%
or dismissed by the military.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear people
all the time that have

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:84%
very high clearances who will
say, oh, this is all bunk

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's not real.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
are telling the truth

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:90%
because that is their truth.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not real for them because
they're out of the loop.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
One guy in particular
was a colonel.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
He called me one day and he
got very upset saying, what

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
are you doing talking
about these UFOs

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:90%
and all this other nonsense?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
It's all a bunch of
bunk and how-- you know,

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:90%
how dare you mislead the people?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And all of this stuff.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
stop it right now.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%

have two things to say to you.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know, the first thing

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:90%
is can you spell civilian.

00:13:58.392 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And the second
thing is that, how

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:90%
come you're out of the loop?

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.560 align:middle line:90%
And he got really quiet.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you mean to
tell me you're a colonel

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know about all
the back engineering going

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:90%
on and all the UFO activity?

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
your jets are here chasing

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.932 align:middle line:90%
them on a constant basis.

00:14:17.932 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: This is military.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.571 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:27.225 align:middle line:84%
I recognize.
It's got the green, the red.

00:14:27.225 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:10%
It's coming in right on the UFO.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.954 align:middle line:84%
He goes basically, he said, we
just want to catch one of them.

00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, here they are.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens is these
jets will come in.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And they have some
pretty interesting craft

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:90%
up there that are very exotic.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.461 align:middle line:84%
They're very quiet
and very fast.

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:55.343 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:14:55.343 --> 00:15:01.592 align:middle line:10%
Here's a obvious military
jet coming right over us.

00:15:01.592 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:10%
It's got a strobe
and two lights.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:10%
Again, these are
totally obvious and it's

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:10%
obvious these aren't the
UFOs that we've been filming.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And they come in on these UFOs.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And the UFOs will
just be sitting there.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
This jet comes screaming
in on this UFO.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden
the UFO just-- pop.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.399 align:middle line:90%
Disappears.

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Skeptics argue
that UFOs are constrained

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
by Newtonian physics, and
even at the speed of light

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:84%
it would take decades to
travel from star to star.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics says
action at a distance

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
enables virtually instantaneous
information transfer.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's these
secrets of science

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.565 align:middle line:84%
that advanced ETs apparently
use to bypass time as we know it

00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:45.401 align:middle line:84%
and appear where and
when they choose.

00:15:45.401 --> 00:15:47.389 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, you guys.

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, come on.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Light up again.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The ships that
come in here power

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.610 align:middle line:90%
up for the people on the ground.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have a joke about--
we call it dazzle duty.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, they come in to
show us that they are here

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:90%
and make themselves known.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
because they'll come in

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and they'll do a tremendous
burst of light and power up

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and you feel it.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I have photographs
of these ships that

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:90%
are just a brilliant light.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they start stepping
their frequencies down.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it becoming
more and more physical.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:90%
And in the end it looks organic.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's a big pill shaped.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like it's
made out of some kind

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:90%
of living organic material.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: So we have
these exotic jets

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
chasing exotic fireballs as
they might describe them.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.033 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: And we also
have black helicopters.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I have some great footage
of black helicopters

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that visit us on
a regular basis.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And some other helicopters too
that seem to be retrofitted.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have-- they're
older helicopters

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
but they have jet
engines in them.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And they have some
incredible gear on then.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: 12:35.
Monday.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.531 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I got a good--

00:17:15.531 --> 00:17:16.364 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:16.364 --> 00:17:17.887 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: --a
good image of them.

00:17:17.887 --> 00:17:19.198 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Who is it?

00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: No markings.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And they have strange
torrents underneath them

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
like a giant pie dish with all
this gear on it that rotates.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And tubes on the front, these
big tubes and all this gear.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.441 align:middle line:84%
I asked people in the Air
Force about these helicopters

00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, yeah.
We've seen them.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
When they land, they
land a distance away

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and they have their own
people that fuel them,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:90%
that take care of them.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.428 align:middle line:84%
You can't go anywhere
near these helicopters.

00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:52.296 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.296 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: James has also
seen stealth bombers

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and filmed military helicopters
equipped with powerful search

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
lights, for some reason
operating over his sanctuary

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:90%
during daylight.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
He says perhaps they
were trying to fool

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:84%
him into making
a fool of himself

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
by claiming this is UFO footage.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
UFOs thoughts have
a higher clearance

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:90%
rating than nuclear bombs.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing as far
as keeping it quiet.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Gemini
astronaut Gordon Cooper,

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:10%
a hero to Americans
who are rightly

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:10%
proud of their
public space program,

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:10%
did not keep completely
quiet about UFOs.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
He said as a fighter pilot
in Germany he chased UFOs,

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and after leaving NASA he's
reported as saying he'd

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
lived with a secret
imposed on the astronauts--

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that radar captures
unknown objects every day.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:10%
Cooper, in fact,
believed Earth was

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.540 align:middle line:10%
being visited by very advanced
beings not of this world.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But that's something the public
has never been told officially.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Anything that NASA experiences
or SETI experiences with UFOs

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
have to go through NSA,
where they decide whether it

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.710 align:middle line:90%
gets released or not.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.024 align:middle line:90%
And it dies right there.

00:18:58.024 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Holy smokes.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.714 align:middle line:90%
This guy is big.

00:18:59.714 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it is.
FEMALE SPEAKER: James.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.919 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: This is coming.

00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:02.852 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: He's out here.

00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:90%
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.773 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Look at this guy.

00:19:04.773 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Did you see this guy coming in?

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
We got one on the tree tops
and one going overhead.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.344 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Powering up.

00:19:10.344 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:90%
FEMALE SPEAKER: See the one--

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:84%
A while back we
issued a statement

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:90%
called the SETI challenge.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:90%
And both with NASA too as well.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.583 align:middle line:84%
And we said we'll all of
our evidence on the table.

00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Wow, look at that.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.132 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: Huge.

00:19:25.132 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: Look at it.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Oh, it doubled.
There it goes.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:10%
It's doubling.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: Huge.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: It split into two.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:90%
It split into two.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.030 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Woo.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:34.963 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Now
it has another one.

00:19:34.963 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Woohoo.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.229 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.
It's doubled.

00:19:37.229 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:10%
Oh, now it's going back.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:10%
It's morphing back into--
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, no.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:10%
It's three.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.160 align:middle line:10%
It's three.
MALE SPEAKER: It is.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: No, it's two now.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: I
saw three before.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: See, I can see--

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: It's
totally doing this.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:10%
Whoa.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.055 align:middle line:10%
Whoa.

00:19:48.055 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have probably over 60
or 70 hours of footage of UFOs

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:90%
here that are coming in.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
They're responding to
the people on the ground.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:90%
They're landing.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They're morphing from one
to four back to one again.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Making right angle
turns and exploding

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:90%
in tremendous balls of light.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Holy shit.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.921 align:middle line:90%
That thing's huge.

00:20:11.921 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's going
back down again.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have all
of this footage,

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
as well as photograph of
metallic craft as well.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And we agreed to take all
of this footage, put it

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
on the table, and they
could put all their footage

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:90%
on the table of UFOs.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And whoever has the best footage
walks away with the funding.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And so nobody took us up
on that, unfortunately.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But the other part of
that process was too

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is that all of the footage
is public domain after that.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:90%
It's available to everybody.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I think the reasons
why they're not

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:84%
making it available to
the public are many fold.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:84%
One is basically whoever has
the best technology in wartime

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:90%
usually wins the war.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And so in the interest
of nationally security,

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want other
people to know that we've

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
been back engineering
these projects

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and developing weaponry
and things of that nature

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:90%
from crash sites.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And Corso wrote a very good book
about that about all the back

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
engineered technology, which
involves computer chips

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and microwave and fiber optics.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things were gleaned

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.435 align:middle line:90%
out of the many crash sites.

00:21:25.435 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Look at that.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Look at the purple coming off.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it?

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.292 align:middle line:90%
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And as we said before,
there were low level contacts

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
in the past, but now it's
evolving into a much higher

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:90%
level contact, you might say.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And the benevolent
and spiritually

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and technologically advanced
beings are coming in now.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part
that's not covered,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:90%
that's not being addressed.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the people that
are in the positions that could

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
address this don't have the
spiritual awareness to even

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:90%
understand this phenomenon.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
They haven't risen
to the occasion.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
The fearlessness it takes
to bring this message out

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:84%
isn't there because
they're so afraid of being

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.995 align:middle line:84%
ridiculed or being laughed
at or their careers ending.

00:22:10.995 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Recording timecode as
he filmed UFOs over many years

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:10%
has been a practice
that adds credibility

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:10%
to the scores of
hours of footage

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:10%
of UFOs filmed at
James Gilliland's

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.927 align:middle line:10%
Trout Lake property.

00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa,
he's lighting up.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.597 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE SPEAKER: Whoa.
Light it up.

00:22:25.597 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa,
he's lighting up.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.371 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
MALE SPEAKER: Paul.

00:22:28.371 --> 00:22:29.271 align:middle line:90%
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, ma'am.

00:22:29.271 --> 00:22:31.774 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa.

00:22:31.774 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:84%
The way we discern what is
a true UFO and what is not

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
is that one of things
we use is Heavens Above

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
website, which gives
us a very clear

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:90%
idea of what's in our area.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll know when--
exactly when the space

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:90%
station is flying over.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
They have this new project
called Genesis up there

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:90%
and it's on Heavens Above.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The iridium flares
are on Heavens Above.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And Envisat, which is
another big satellite

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:90%
that puts out quite a light.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Contact for the masses
is already underway.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It's been underway
for some time.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is they're

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:84%
making themselves visible
now much more than before.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Madrid just had hundreds
of ships flying over.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, the capital of Spain.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:84%
China is seeing all
kinds of UFO activity.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Mexico.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
It's unprecedented with
thousands of ships in the air.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I've seen footage
of ships over Mexico

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
where the whole
frame is full of UFOs

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're all moving
synchronistically.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is happening
on a regular basis.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Peru, Brazil, everywhere.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's headline news.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a total
headline news there.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
But where is our press?

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Why-- you've got a whole
flotilla flying over capitals

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:84%
of countries that
are being witnessed

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
by thousands of
people, but where--

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:90%
why is that not in our news?

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:90%
We have to ask that question.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is quite simple.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.251 align:middle line:90%
The news is totally controlled.

00:24:08.251 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: In January 2007,
two months after the event,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:10%
the media reported
that a UFO was

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:10%
sighted over Chicago's
O'Hare Airport

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:10%
by pilots and ground crew.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:10%
It hovered, then shot
up through the clouds.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:10%
Officialdom, as
always, dismissed it

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.320 align:middle line:10%
as a weather phenomenon.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But how do you dismiss former
Arizona state governor, Fife

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Symington, also a pilot,
who tells The Arizona Star

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
that the lights
seen over Phoenix

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:84%
a decade ago were
from another world.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I think if I had
control of the news

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I would put more spiritual
content, more positive content.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
More information concerning
fuel-less energy breakthroughs.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Which is also taboo.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.240 align:middle line:90%
You never hear about that.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I would bring forward
major cures for diseases

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:90%
which have been held back.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I would bring
forward people that

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:84%
are on the forefront
of these technologies

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:90%
and this new wisdom coming out.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: So who
is James Gilliland?

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
A man on a sanctuary
who's had near death

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:84%
experiences, UFO visits, and
contact with advanced ETs.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But as others on the
forefront of radical thinking

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.010 align:middle line:84%
have discovered, peace often
follows adversity, which

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
can lead to deep reflection
on serious spiritual issues,

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
extensive and life changing
study of many great teachings,

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and eventually a
sense that personality

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:84%
is not the yardstick by
which to introduce oneself.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I have a hard time
talking about myself.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather be
referred to as nobody

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not
really important.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
What's important is
this information.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you are
nobody, there's nobody

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that needs defending
when you bring out

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:90%
this outrageous information.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.527 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Near death experiences
are not everybody's experience.

00:25:54.527 --> 00:25:55.481 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

00:25:55.481 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: How do they
happen to you and how often?

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The first experiences I had
when I was about five years

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:90%
old, I had bronchial pneumonia.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I kept going
in between worlds.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had a woman
that appeared to me

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and she was dressed in blue
and had electric blue eyes.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Just beautiful.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And her energy was
beautiful as well,

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:90%
extremely loving and nurturing.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And she kept coming to me.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And she would stroke my head and
just be with me and talk to me.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And then she gave me this
substance that seemed

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:90%
like ice cream, but it wasn't.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't cold but it had
the texture of ice cream.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would eat this ice
cream and then I would

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
get better all of a sudden.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.677 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
four or five times.

00:26:42.677 --> 00:26:44.610 align:middle line:84%
They called my parents and
said, we don't think he's going

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:90%
to make it through the night.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.689 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: You were in hospital?
-Yes.

00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I was in a hospital.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
After that experience,
I moved into the world

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:84%
of social consciousness
going through, you know,

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
elementary school
and high school

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and making my mark
in the world, trying

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:90%
to be accepted and approved of.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Trying to win, you know,
the love of my life

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:90%
through outer appearances.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Because all that
programming you get,

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have the
fancy car, the fancy house,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.115 align:middle line:90%
the fancy clothes.

00:27:17.115 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: Were you successful?

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I was.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I was very successful at
acquiring all those things

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:84%
until I realized that
they were meaningless

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and that I was going about
it all the wrong way.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the
real awakening was when

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I had the drowning experience.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.224 align:middle line:90%
And I was out body surfing and--

00:27:36.224 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: Where abouts?

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It was a place
called a Little Corona

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:84%
down in Southern California next
to what they call the Wedge.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're way out on
a sand bar with about

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:90%
six to eight foot waves.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:90%
And just having a great time.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know
these sneaker waves came in.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:84%
A sneaker wave is where three
waves will back up together

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and they come in out of nowhere.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually because of a
storm or some other instability

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.230 align:middle line:90%
out in the ocean.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.984 align:middle line:90%
And these waves came in.

00:28:03.984 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:90%
And they were measured.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:90%
They were in the newspaper.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.550 align:middle line:90%
They were 17 to 25 foot waves.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And we were pretty
far out on a sand bar

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and there was nowhere to go.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
There's just this big huge
wall of water coming at you.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And when the first wave hit
me, I was doing everything

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:90%
I could do to get under it.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And it crashed right on top of
me and dislocated my shoulder

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and knocked the wind out of
me and just hit me like a fly.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Held me under forever.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally came
up after that wave hit,

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get
any air because it

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
hit me so hard my
diaphragm was collapsed

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and I was trying to breathe.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I had the wind
knocked out of me.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And the next wave came,
pulled me under again

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:90%
and held me forever.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when I finally
struggled to get up out

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:84%
of the second wave,
the third wave came.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And then I just gave up.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, that's it.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's-- and I
remember the tunnel of light

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:90%
that everybody talks about.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I went through the tunnel.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have people
there to greet me.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:90%
I saw a lot of levels.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just blasted through
these levels and kept going.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up in what
they call the golden plane

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of bliss where you're
held in the arms of God

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.220 align:middle line:90%
or the cradle of God.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
My experience there was
that I was a light being.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:84%
There was a greater
light and a greater

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:90%
consciousness surrounding me.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I still had a sense
of self, but there's

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:84%
a much greater self
that was surrounding me,

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:90%
but I was a part of that.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And we had a communication
going back and forth.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most loving,
joyous, secure, blissful energy

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.490 align:middle line:90%
you could imagine.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I had no understanding
of myself as being dead.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:84%
That seemed to be a whole
nother something I left behind

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:84%
because I was fully
awake and fully

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:90%
alive and fully conscious.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't have the
limitations of the body

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:90%
anymore in that realm.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had a conversation
with this consciousness.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
asked was, how can I stay?

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:90%
The voice came back to me.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
transmission, thought

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.950 align:middle line:90%
to thought transmission.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And it said, I've never
told any of my children

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:90%
when to come or go.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:90%
That's free will.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to start letting
go of my old images of God

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:84%
that were given me because I--
through the Catholic church,

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to a Catholic
church when I was in the desert

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.060 align:middle line:84%
because it was the
only school there.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
I asked was, how

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:90%
can I earn the right to stay?

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And the voice came
back to me and says,

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
you cannot earn what is given
freely and unconditionally.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm going, wait a minute.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Here's the program
I have to release.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:84%
That I have to win
favor of God or I

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:84%
have to do all these things
to get love and acceptance

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:90%
and approval of God.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:90%
And the voice came back to me.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And it said, what
do you want to do?

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:90%
What brings you joy?

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was waiting for this big
long list of all these things

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:90%
I was going to have to do.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And all the source wanted me to
do was do what brought me joy.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So I thought about it and I
said, I want to come back.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to return
and teach people

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:90%
about the true nature of God.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
The last words I heard from
the source were, as you wish.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know I
felt myself back in my body

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and I felt somebody
grabbing my arm

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and pulling me in
out of the water.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was crawling
up to the beach.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.960 align:middle line:90%
And I passed out.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in a
big pool of water,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the water was coming out
of my lungs and everything

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.190 align:middle line:90%
with somebody yelling my name.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
The near death experiences
started me on a path

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:90%
where-- especially the drowning.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to connect
again with that pure love

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and joy and bliss and
reestablish that connection

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:90%
and understand it.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't really have
any framework to understand it.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I returned,
I was ultra sensitive

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.560 align:middle line:84%
again, even more sensitive
than I was when I was a kid.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was struggling
because I was

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.900 align:middle line:90%
experiencing the whole gamut.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I was experiencing incredible
beings of light and very loving

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
powerful beings, but I was
also experiencing some lower,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
discarnate beings and some
forces that weren't so nice,

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led me into the
teachings of the inner Christ,

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
which is a very powerful
teaching that teaches you how

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to heal unseen negative
influences, how to manifest,

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:84%
how to maintain your energies
and make sure you're receiving

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.290 align:middle line:90%
guidance of the highest levels.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I went
to the Tibetan Foundation

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
where I was certified as
one of their best channels.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:10%
One of the experiences I had
after the near death experience

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:10%
is that within the Tibetan
Foundation I left my body again

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.120 align:middle line:10%
and I went to a very high
plane where I met this being

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Cazekiel, which
is a merged energy of Cassia,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:10%
a feminine energy, and Ezekial,
the original contactee,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:10%
you might say, that we know of.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
these metallic ships

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.620 align:middle line:90%
in the firmament coming down.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
They had bronze
feet like calves.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:84%
They had fire and
brimstone coming

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.620 align:middle line:90%
out from underneath them.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.050 align:middle line:84%
When they landed, they sounded
like a thousand rushing rivers.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And what is that with today's
mentality or awareness?

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You listen to this and you
go, boy, that was a ship.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Out of it come
cherubim, which were

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
wheels within
wheels with flashing

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:90%
lights all around them.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:90%
They were moving all around.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
In Santa Cruz I was very-- I
had it made there, basically.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I had a beautiful house right
on the beach, had a nice hot tub

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and the classes
were going great.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just pretty much
rode my bike everywhere.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I kept having these visions
and I would see the buildings.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would see
that-- the ranch here

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and what I wanted to create here
over and over again in my mind.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I was having

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
visions of some
major earth changes

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:90%
coming to the Santa Cruz area.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I saw some major
earthquakes hitting that area.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And I also saw some
tsunamis in the future

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:90%
that were going to come in.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And I gave the exact date
and time of the big San

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.503 align:middle line:90%
Francisco earthquake.

00:34:04.503 --> 00:34:07.401 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: United States
Geological Survey records

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:84%
tell us that at five in the
afternoon on October 17, 1989,

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:84%
the San Andreas fault system
had its first major quake

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.370 align:middle line:90%
since 1906.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.420 align:middle line:90%
62 people died.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Almost 4,000 were injured.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
The epicenter was located near
Loma Prieta peak in the Santa

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Cruz mountains, approximately
nine miles northeast

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of James Gilliland's
home in Santa Cruz.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It caused over $6
billion in damage.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Over 18,000 homes and 2,600
businesses were damaged,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and about 3,000 people
were left homeless.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I missed
was, I was told it would be 6.9

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
and in the end it was 7.1.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
But the first readings were 6.9.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.650 align:middle line:84%
After the Tibetan
Foundation, I went

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:84%
into about six years of
intense yoga training

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.430 align:middle line:90%
with different yogis.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I also went
through an initiation

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.070 align:middle line:90%
with the Tibetan master as well.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting,
each one of these masters

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:84%
recognized something
very different about me

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and got very
excited when we met.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that I had a
very big mission here on Earth.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.161 align:middle line:84%
And all of them validated
the work that I'm doing.

00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Those who
have put out the thought

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
of conscious contact and then
seen a UFO do a power up know

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.380 align:middle line:84%
for certain that they have
contacted and been contacted

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.020 align:middle line:90%
by something out of this world.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And then those who are becoming
enlightened also know there is

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:84%
another type of UFO,
much closer to home,

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
waiting to power up,
waiting to be discovered.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
The greatest year
for we're ever

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.350 align:middle line:84%
going to experience
on the planet

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.030 align:middle line:90%
is our own physical bodies.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we can increase
our frequencies,

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:84%
we can actually move
out of these bodies

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and experience all of these
other planes and dimensions.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We have that
capability within us.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And we also have the
capability to actually take

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
the body with us as
well in what they

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.165 align:middle line:90%
call the ascension process.

00:36:11.165 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The ET
connection would

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.780 align:middle line:84%
come to James at Mount
Adams, revered for centuries

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:90%
by Native Americans.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.390 align:middle line:84%
The Yakama Tribe has many
stories of unusual craft

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and lights in its vicinity,
and for James, himself

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:84%
part Cherokee, it was as if
the mountain was calling,

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.890 align:middle line:84%
at least in visions
which were now

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.585 align:middle line:90%
a regular feature of his life.

00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: I was receiving
visions over and over again.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And the visions showed me
this beautiful mountain,

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.910 align:middle line:84%
a river on the eastern
border, and then a little

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.520 align:middle line:90%
mountain behind me.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And I actually saw the
letters little mountain

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know what that--
I said, why are they focusing

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:90%
on the little mountain?

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense
whatsoever when

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:84%
you have this massive Mount
Adams in front of you,

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.775 align:middle line:90%
which is just beautiful.

00:36:54.775 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I kept seeing this
vision over and over again.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I grabbed a map
of the United States.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.315 align:middle line:84%
And I got a pendulum and I was
going over the map to find it.

00:37:03.315 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:84%
My hand got real
hot over Trout Lake.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And it just started spinning
radically, the pendulum.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And I marked it on the map.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And my whole focus was to
create a template of heaven

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:19.330 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, how we can
live a wholesome,

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
spiritual life in harmony
with nature and each other.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: So something
triggered you at some point

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:90%
to make the move.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a combination of seeing
the vision and my purpose,

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:35.060 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I was supposed
to build this template, a much

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:90%
bigger center.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And to do a lot of the things
that I was teaching there.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: James has
photographic evidence

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:84%
of the higher frequencies and
realms that he's experienced.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:84%
While the human brain
filters certain frequencies,

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:84%
digital cameras
record energy fields

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and entities that are unseen
by the average human mind.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Detractors may
attempt to explain

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:10%
these anomalies away
as lens aberrations,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.330 align:middle line:10%
but the evidence persists.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:10%
Orbs, for example, which are
conscious but disembodied

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:10%
beings, and plasma
entities as well,

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.080 align:middle line:10%
are frequently photographed
at James' ranch.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is a black night sky
where visitors are engaged

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:90%
in what's termed a sky watch.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.820 align:middle line:84%
They're scanning the skies
above Mount Adams in the hope

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.360 align:middle line:90%
of seeing UFOs for themselves.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.725 align:middle line:84%
And many do have
that experience.

00:38:26.725 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: There it goes.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Here it goes.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.589 align:middle line:84%
It's going.
Woo hoo.

00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Woo hoo.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.710 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Holy smokes.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.486 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:38:37.486 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Critics, of
course, continue to deny

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.580 align:middle line:90%
that any of this is real.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But many more have a genuine
desire to actually experience

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.700 align:middle line:90%
visual and conscious contact.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of these ships that
are coming over here right,

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:90%
now some look like satellites.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And some are satellites
and some are not.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.985 align:middle line:84%
And the only you
can tell, really,

00:38:55.985 --> 00:38:58.580 align:middle line:84%
is through being able to
connect with them consciously.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:84%
But they'll fly high first
and they scan the group

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and see where you're
at in consciousness.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
In the very beginning,
some of the ETs

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.700 align:middle line:84%
that came here, which-- are
what I call low level contacts--

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:90%
had an agenda.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't in our
highest and best good.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And they aligned with people who
also had the same consciousness

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.230 align:middle line:84%
because the mind
in which you seek

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:90%
is the mind which you connect.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have people that were more
focused on technology and war.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was their whole
drive, is to have the best

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:37.010 align:middle line:90%
technology to win the wars.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they connected with
some low level contacts.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
there was another group

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:90%
that came in that said, look.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
give you the technology

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.490 align:middle line:90%
until you choose peace.

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
group that we should

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.850 align:middle line:90%
have aligned ourselves with.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But instead they aligned
with the lower evolved ETs,

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.590 align:middle line:90%
you might say, for technology.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
trade involved where

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:08.080 align:middle line:84%
they were actually abducting
people and using genetics.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.610 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The great questions
are, where did we come from?

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if space was, in
fact, the birthplace of DNA

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, DNA shared
throughout the galaxies

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:90%
by evolving civilizations.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And what if our grossly
misnamed junk DNA is actually

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:84%
the DNA of the gods,
waiting to be activated

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and holding within it
the keys to our future

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:84%
as genuinely enlightened members
of the intergalactic family?

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:84%
We have extremely incredible
genetics on this planet.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We have the genetics
from the star nations,

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.930 align:middle line:84%
you might say, from so
many different beings

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.310 align:middle line:90%
are on this planet.

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a big smorgasbord or zoo
of genetics, you might say.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Not just human
genetics, but animal

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and plant genetics as well.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is such an amazing
place because of the diversity

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.740 align:middle line:84%
of life here and the diversity
of genetics is nowhere else

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.190 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to be
preserved because of that.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:15.500 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: DNA from Earth
might save a dying space race.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But the human race, though
it has reached for the moon,

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:84%
seems almost oblivious to
what's really happening at home.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Preoccupied with endless wars,
we ignore global warming,

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.540 align:middle line:84%
hurricanes, widespread
destruction,

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.870 align:middle line:84%
pollution on a global scale
from the melting Antarctica

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and ozone depletion
to the melting Arctic

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:84%
where wildlife is
increasingly endangered.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.550 align:middle line:84%
What was once a mother planet
that nurtured all its species

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:45.010 align:middle line:84%
is now a mother in
danger of dying.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:49.200 align:middle line:84%
The greater family
of man or the off

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:84%
worlders you might
call them are deeply

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:84%
concerned with where we're going
concerning the environment.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.630 align:middle line:84%
We've had the earthquakes
and volcanic activity

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:02.010 align:middle line:90%
has increased 400%.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:05.370 align:middle line:84%
We've got over 50 plus
active volcanoes right now

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:06.850 align:middle line:90%
and counting.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.920 align:middle line:84%
How many volcanoes
could erupt if prompted

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.460 align:middle line:90%
by a large gravitational field?

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:10%
This is the location of all
the volcanoes on the Earth.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: There's undersea
volcanoes going off.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:84%
That's also heating
up the ocean.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Look at the yellow
there with it-- oh, my God.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:30.550 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: There's over 50 dead
zones in the ocean right now.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.650 align:middle line:84%
One of them is over
700 miles wide.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:33.970 align:middle line:84%

numbers of dead crabs

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and dead and dying seals
suffering from leptospirosis.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.240 align:middle line:84%
While a majority of dead
zones are less than 1,000

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.880 align:middle line:84%

Since the recent breakup
of the Larsen B ice shelf,

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:07.280 align:middle line:84%

But as the ice melts,
more sunlight hits

the water, heating the ocean.

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And that accelerates
next season's ice melt.

The serious consequence of
all that fresh water flowing

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:49.050 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean is that the
Atlantic conveyor belt,

and realize that we live in this
incredible sea of consciousness

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.880 align:middle line:90%

I've always wanted to
ask a tractor driver,

and that is what is
cognitive dissonance?

00:47:54.951 --> 00:47:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, cognitive dissonance is
the total inability to accept

any belief outside of your own.

perhaps, in other definition

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:06.700 align:middle line:84%
as a closed mind?
-Yes.

No matter how much evidence
or how much proof you give

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:84%

any reality outside their own.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.790 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Is this a
widespread disorder?

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd say most of the

I believe the cure is
to just, again, you know,

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:34.850 align:middle line:84%
face life with an open mind, a
loving heart, and pure intent.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:36.715 align:middle line:84%
And allow the universe
to teach you things.

00:48:36.715 --> 00:48:38.510 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: But are
we willing to learn

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.666 align:middle line:90%
that UFOs can look like clouds?

00:48:40.666 --> 00:48:42.770 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: They could be actually
sitting within a cloud

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and watching us at any time.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not saying
all clouds are UFOs.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:50.900 align:middle line:84%
There are natural formations
of clouds that are lenticular

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and others of that nature.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But it is highly possible that
the fields around the UFOs

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.100 align:middle line:84%
generate kind of a cloud
formation around the ship.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.290 align:middle line:84%
They're talking a
lot about the future

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.510 align:middle line:84%

prepare and there's

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.440 align:middle line:84%

And nature is going to be
very active in this process.

As far as nature is concerned,
our whole heliosphere,

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.620 align:middle line:84%
our solar system, is moving
to a new place in the universe

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.640 align:middle line:84%

1,000 times brighter.

They're going through
atmospheric changes.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The sun is reacting
to this, throwing off

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.720 align:middle line:84%
massive coronal mass
ejections and solar flares.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's affecting
our weather.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting
our communication.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting our
consciousness as well.

just as there are four seasons

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.820 align:middle line:84%
in a year, which means
everything from ants to humans

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.990 align:middle line:84%
must prepare for
winter, there are

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:05.200 align:middle line:84%
much longer planetary
cycles of seasons

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.370 align:middle line:90%
spanning thousands of years.

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a season of
planetary changes, which

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:14.290 align:middle line:84%
have always involved global
earthquakes, tsunamis,

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and volcanic
activity that creates

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.110 align:middle line:90%
magma vents like Mount Adams.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Mount Adams has a very, very
long history of UFO activity.

It has at least a
100 year history

of people seeing the ships.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.420 align:middle line:84%
They've got forest rangers
and fire tower operators

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the police, the
tribal police, everybody.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:40.040 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient times, they said
that when their wounded were--

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.980 align:middle line:84%
people got wounded
or really sick or ill

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.620 align:middle line:84%
they used to take them
to a certain place.

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And they would come from
the interior of the mountain

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and pick their sick
or their wounded

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.080 align:middle line:84%
up and take them
into the mountain.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.850 align:middle line:84%

or the chief would

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:84%
get a message, like a
telepathic message, it's time.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And they would go back up
and pick their people up

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:00.784 align:middle line:90%
and they'd be completely well.

00:51:00.784 --> 00:51:01.550 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, OK.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.006 align:middle line:90%
I can see the mountain now.

00:51:03.006 --> 00:51:03.938 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa.

00:51:03.938 --> 00:51:05.090 align:middle line:90%
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, just--

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:05.956 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: There it is.

00:51:05.956 --> 00:51:07.289 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:51:07.289 --> 00:51:08.721 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE SPEAKER: See
how bright they are?

00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:09.465 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
OK.

00:51:09.465 --> 00:51:10.701 align:middle line:90%
I've got the mountain.

00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:11.834 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Come on, light up.

00:51:11.834 --> 00:51:12.726 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa.

00:51:12.726 --> 00:51:13.426 align:middle line:90%
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:51:13.426 --> 00:51:14.692 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: I've
got those two guys.

00:51:14.692 --> 00:51:15.515 align:middle line:90%
FEMALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:51:15.515 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: And
I've got the mountain.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Watching ships power up
and come out of the mountain

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and actually go
into the mountain,

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:29.980 align:middle line:84%
they seem to
dematerialize and go

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.980 align:middle line:90%
straight through the mountain.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.046 align:middle line:90%
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, there he goes.

00:51:32.046 --> 00:51:32.760 align:middle line:90%
There he goes.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.780 align:middle line:10%
Look at him.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.110 align:middle line:10%
Look at him power up.
Did you see that?

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:35.980 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: Woohoo.
Yep.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.266 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: I got that
whole thing on film.

00:51:38.266 --> 00:51:39.260 align:middle line:10%
MALE SPEAKER: I got it.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.940 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: For years, James
and others have filmed UFOs

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.410 align:middle line:10%
with basic consumer camcorders.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.590 align:middle line:10%
In other words, as James says--

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:47.960 align:middle line:10%
Anybody can shoot UFOs.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:84%
All it takes is an open mind, a
loving heart, and pure intent.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.370 align:middle line:90%
And put the thought out there.

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And they'll find you eventually.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's nothing special
about photographing UFOs.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The establishment
the center here,

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.790 align:middle line:90%
there was many levels to it.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the levels, the
original name for it,

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.850 align:middle line:84%
was Sattva Sanctuary,
which means

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to aspire to the highest levels
of wisdom and beauty and art.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, basically
reach the highest

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.790 align:middle line:90%
levels of creativity we can.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And then it involved
into ECETI, which

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.490 align:middle line:84%
stands for Enlightened
Contact with Extraterrestrial

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:33.450 align:middle line:84%
They have transcended
war, disease, poverty.

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:84%
They've transcended all
religious boundaries

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and cultural boundaries.

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And they have that wisdom
and that technology

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to share with humanity,
which is in direct conflict

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.000 align:middle line:84%
with those who are
capitalizing at the expense

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.800 align:middle line:90%
of humanity and the earth.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But the main problem is, on
this planet, is the leadership.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And the leadership does
not reflect the desires

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.416 align:middle line:90%
and wishes of the masses.

00:52:59.416 --> 00:53:02.360 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Is it so hard to
imagine that among the billions

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.470 align:middle line:84%
of stars and quadrillions
of planets out there,

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:08.950 align:middle line:84%
there are indeed
greater civilizations.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.330 align:middle line:84%
How hard would it
be to be a greater

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:15.090 align:middle line:84%
civilization than the one
that currently inhabits Earth?

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Instead of reaching
for the stars

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to meet those greater beings,
we have reached for our guns

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and we've become one
of the most warlike

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.220 align:middle line:90%
species in the universe.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We use or threaten to use
atomic weapons to ensure peace.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.570 align:middle line:90%
We talk of peace.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.690 align:middle line:90%
We fight for peace.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:37.490 align:middle line:90%
We kill for peace.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:39.630 align:middle line:90%
We embrace war.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:43.190 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there is no
such thing as a holy war.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Every war is because one
king or leader wanted what

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:90%
another king or leader had.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is the main
drive behind--or

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.840 align:middle line:90%
motivation behind these wars.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.920 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.980 align:middle line:10%
The first greeting we give
these off world visitors

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.180 align:middle line:10%
is aggression.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.870 align:middle line:10%
And we send up our
best technologies

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.430 align:middle line:10%
in the area to greet them and
attempt to shoot them down,

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:13.960 align:middle line:10%
steal their technology, and
use it in the war industry.

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, lovers
of the Armageddon scenario

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and even some of today's feet on
the ground scientists envisage

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:24.630 align:middle line:84%
civilization as we know it
disappearing from this planet,

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.980 align:middle line:90%
perhaps much sooner than later.

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Some worry that
Earth will eventually

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.560 align:middle line:90%
destroy itself with our help.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the unspoken end
result of global warming and

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.890 align:middle line:90%
increasing natural disasters.

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But those who love
Terra, including masters

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.430 align:middle line:84%
of the past and present and off
worlders, as James Gilliland

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:45.920 align:middle line:84%
calls them, have all
had a common message

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.570 align:middle line:84%
of hope about humanity's
true potential,

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:52.590 align:middle line:84%
which is why they'll set the
example, a spiritual awakening.

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the common thread
between all of the masters,

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and the ETs as well
because they're

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.420 align:middle line:84%
giving the same messages
that all of the masters

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.100 align:middle line:84%
have been giving for
thousands of years,

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and it follows under
the understandings

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:14.720 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
separation omnipresence,

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:90%
that we're all connected.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.020 align:middle line:84%
We all came from
the same source.

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.290 align:middle line:84%
We all go back to
the same source.

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of the masters
have given us this message.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And lot of these
messages were inspired

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.270 align:middle line:84%
by the ETs over the past and
then got twisted and warped

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:31.690 align:middle line:90%
by kings and institutions.

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But the main message right now
that they're giving us is they

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.940 align:middle line:84%
are very concerned
with our consciousness

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.250 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth and our primitive
aggressive warlike nature.

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.400 align:middle line:90%
They want us to let that go.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They want us to release the
past because these old grudges

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and old belief systems are
what is creating our tomorrow

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and what is creating the wars
and all of the other problems

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:56.240 align:middle line:90%
that we're having.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:59.080 align:middle line:84%
They want us to stop with
the greed and the competition

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and start cooperating
and working together.

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We have a golden opportunity
right now to join

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:07.300 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the
universe in peace

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and to unite with these beings
that are extremely spiritually

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and technologically
advanced, far

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.450 align:middle line:90%
beyond anything we can imagine.

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And they can assist us to
transcend war and disease

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.880 align:middle line:90%
and clean up our environment.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
the ultimate goal.

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:29.570 align:middle line:84%
That's our goal here at
ECETI to bridge the gap

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and to rise to the occasion
so we can have these contacts

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and can share in
this information.

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And that is our whole goal.

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And take this information
and disseminate it out

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:46.060 align:middle line:84%
to humanity, the Earth, to
help us in our own quantum leap

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.830 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness and evolution.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.180 align:middle line:90%
