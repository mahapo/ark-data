00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Barry.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.440 align:middle line:90%
They call me Clunker.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm one of the original
people of the gatherings.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the gatherings is a
lot of visionary process.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a whole lot
of common sense--

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:84%
what we call faith
and elbow grease.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what it
is is that people come

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and volunteer to share,
and provide, and help

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:90%
set up the ceremonial grounds--

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
the gathering grounds, as we
call them, the common grounds--

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and for ceremonies for people
to come from all over the world

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
to share their prayer, their
expression, their speech,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
their art, their
music, their lives,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:90%
and to connect with one another.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, out of all of the
Earth, all over the Earth,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.147 align:middle line:84%
there are people
who believe that all

00:00:57.147 --> 00:00:58.855 align:middle line:84%
the people of the
Earth are their family,

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
are their spiritual
brothers and sisters.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, out of all of
that, some of them

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
fly the rainbow
colors year round.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And out of that, from
all over the world

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
comes people to the
annual gathering

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
of the tribes in North America
here, July 1 through 7.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.313 align:middle line:84%
And they come early from
the global Rainbow Family.

00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:90%
They're flying their colors.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And the folks who come home,
and help, and volunteer,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and help out, and
give their consensus,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
their good vibrations--
their will, their goodwill--

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to the circle are the
Rainbow Family tribe.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, of all of these
people, over the years

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:90%
we discovered a common sense--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
consensus, as we call it--

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.282 align:middle line:84%
that there is
community kitchens.

00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And out of these
community kitchens

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.275 align:middle line:84%
now, there are many,
many crews that come.

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, at this
gathering, there's

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
probably about 100
to 150 kitchens.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, how are these
kitchens set up?

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.703 align:middle line:10%
They're set up so that
they not only provide food,

00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:10%
but they also provide
an opportunity to people

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:10%
to collect together and help
one another, feed one another.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:10%
This also works the same way
with digging slit trenches,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:10%
parking cars, doing circles.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So in a lot of ways,
it's all sort of prayer.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But we have people come
from all over the world.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And right here, right
now, there is probably

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:90%
20,000 people in the circle.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:10%
We had hundreds, and hundreds,
and hundreds of children--

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:10%
perhaps it's almost as
many as 2,000 children.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have even more
than that on site.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the circle,
there was probably

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.177 align:middle line:84%
another 20,000 people
on the outer edge,

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:90%
all through the gathering.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It stretched for miles,
and miles, and miles.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, of all of these
people, over the years

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:10%
we discovered a common sense--

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:10%
consensus, as we call it--

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.842 align:middle line:10%
that there is
community kitchens.

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And out of these
community kitchens

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.785 align:middle line:84%
now, there are many,
many crews that come.

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, at this
gathering, there's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
probably about 100
to 150 kitchens.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, how are these
kitchens set up?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.172 align:middle line:84%
They're set up so that
they not only provide food,

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
but they also provide an
opportunity for people

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to collect together and help
one another, feed one another.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we now have people
who come-- and have,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
for many years, since
very beginning days, which

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I helped begin-- which is what
we call the scouting and seed

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
camps.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And these scouting help
find the appropriate site.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:10%
And the seed camp people
come, and Spring Council,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:10%
who looks at all the
options the scouts provide.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:90%
And they reach a consensus.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:90%
That's not a decision.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:90%
That's a consensus.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a different thing.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we need
more slit trenches,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
if we need more
people to park cars,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
if we need more people to
haul in food, or water pipe,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
or any of these other
things, then people

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
volunteer of their
own free will.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
It's all done by individuals
operating their own free will

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:84%
but, in fact, seeking to
help the community develop.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
For instance, they
leave their jobs

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:84%
on a two-week vacation from
Wall Street, and businesses,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and jobs, and all
these kinds of places.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And they may come out
here-- lawyers, and doctors,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:10%
and nurses, and garbage
people, and truck drivers,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:10%
all these kinds of people,
because most of the--

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.782 align:middle line:10%
90% of the people that
come out here work jobs.

00:04:46.782 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:10%
And they work jobs in
their neighborhoods

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and their communities.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:10%
The other 10%-- they're like
road dogs, and a lot of them

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:10%
are young.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who live
on the road that come early.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them work festivals,
and have shops, and do crafts,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and make things.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
There ain't no lazy
people in the Rainbow.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
There are people who come
here that just take the ride.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
all the rest of us.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
The young people who
learn one thing--

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:90%
that our mantra is peace.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:90%
We win.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:10%
Look after the land.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:10%
We look after the people.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Live lightly on the land.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Clean it up and take
it away when you go.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And be friendly to the
store owners in the towns.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Remember, every one of those
brothers and sisters out there

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:90%
who come home, consider this--

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:90%
respect is our way.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Respect is our way.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Respect is our way.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Respect is our way.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Jesus.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of footwork,
a lot of preparation work,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that goes into making
one of these amazing,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:90%
instantaneous events.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
By instantaneous, it may
be two or three weeks.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the lifecycle of a
forest, it's like a moment.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And we want to come in, protect
the earth, protect the water,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
protect all the ruffled feathers
that can happen in a community

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:90%
when a lot of strangers come in.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And we want to do that and
work with the proper officials

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:90%
from A to Z.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
When our initial crew identifies
the site that we want to use

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.210 align:middle line:84%
for the gathering, we work with
the Forest Service resource

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
people, water
people, land people,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and their traffic and road
people to make sure that we can

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
have a really good operating
plan that will cover everything

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
from fire evacuation
if necessary--

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
or fire preparedness,
which is always necessary--

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:84%
medical evacuation, land
use, stream protection.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
We work on all these things with
the Forest Service officials.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
medical, we work

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
with local hospital officials.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
In the case of fire, we work
with the local fire officials.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:90%
The local teams meet our teams.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And together, we make a
safe and healthy gathering.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:84%
As the scouts come
into a new site,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
we try to locate the
major facilities--

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
such as the comm unit, which is
the medical unit, the bakery,

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
which is a very high
foot-traffic area,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:84%
the Children's Village, called
kiddie city or kiddie village--

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
to try to locate these
along a network of the most

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:90%
obvious trail.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we use old
deer and cow trails,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
because those are already
broken into the forests.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And then these
trails get marked.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:90%
They get flagged.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They get beautiful,
colorful signs with glitter

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
frou-frou on them

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
so that people can find
their way without having

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
to hike through every
virgin hillside,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
trampling the grasses,
because in the end, what

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:84%
we do is we come to all these
newly made trails between all

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
this network of
camps and kitchens,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:90%
and we water bar them.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We cover them over with
sticks, rocks, and duff.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
We do what we call
naturalizing, which is--

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we think of, what's the
squirrel's-eye view of this

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:90%
world after we leave?

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Are there no, what we
call, pocket-trash pieces?

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Cigarette butts, obviously,
but also little bits of string,

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:84%
little bits of cellophane,
a candy wrapper--

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:90%
we clean all these up.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, on the
most steep trails,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are
problematic for erosion

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
that we would identify
with the Forest Service

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:84%
as a problem trail, we go
in with a team of people.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And we cut diagonally-offset
water bars,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and rock these water bars, or
put wood in on these water bars

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:84%
so that, until the foliage
comes back from its roots--

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
which it does,
for foot traffic--

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:84%
the water will run off to the
left and run off to the right.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And then the plants
will grow back,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and the trail will vanish,
as if we had never been here.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what we try to do.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that, over the
last 35 years of gatherings,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
if you return to the
old gathering sites,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
there is no trace anywhere that
all these people were here.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
If everybody gathering here
was silver hair-- or partly

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
silver hair, like me-
I would still gather.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't be nearly
as enthused as I am today,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
because when I look
around this camp,

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
silver hairs here.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But the great percentage of
the population is young 20s.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And that says to
me that the ideals

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that we held as
valuable, or sacred,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:84%
or beautiful in the 1960s have
meaning to the young people

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And they should have
meaning, because the fact

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:90%
is that the world is a mess.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And what on Earth
is going to help us?

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The world-- there needs to be
some kind of cultural movement

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:90%
that can bring people together.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And if it's just us old '60s
hippies, it isn't enough.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But when I look
around this camp and I

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:84%
see all these young people
from the inner city,

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
from Alaska, from
foreign countries,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.570 align:middle line:84%
working together--
carrying the heavy loads,

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
building the bridges over the
streams, cooking the food,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:90%
washing the pots.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, there are more
teenagers in this encampment,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
in this Rainbow
Gathering, washing dishes

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
without having to be told to
than at any city in America.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I think this country is
concentrated on family values.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've forgotten
community values--

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
the values of working
together, the values

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
of helping out that person
who doesn't have a sleeping

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
bag good enough for the
cold, the values of helping

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that handicapped person
in their wheelchair

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
over that woodland branch.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
We grow up in a world
where everybody says,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
charity is good, the 1,000
points of light is good.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But we need to teach
this to our young people

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
as a hands-on experience--
not something you write

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
a check to in the
mail, but something

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
you can do with your own
hands, helping another person.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I don't know
if it saves the world.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think it makes the
world a little better place.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, there.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:90%
My name is Joanie Freedom.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:84%
The first gathering
I ever came to

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
was the tail end of
the Arkansas gathering.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
There were 800 people there.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
The next time I went to
a gathering was in 1980.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And the gathering was 40
miles from where I lived.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So I hitchhiked over to check
it out and came back and stayed.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very nice.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Since 1980, I have only missed,
I think, two gatherings.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
That's not a lot.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I love the gatherings.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
It's such a nice
place to center,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to find your spiritual side,
to rejuvenate from the world.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty hard out in the
world for a lot of people,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:10%
and this is a good place to
come and just re-energize.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I come to the gatherings for
the prayer on the 4th of July.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the center of
the whole thing.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.350 align:middle line:90%
To pray for peace on Earth--

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:90%
very important to me.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
spiritual activity.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I have a camp from people
from my area that I camp with.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And we start all our meals
with oms and prayers.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And this whole thing
is very, very touching.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a heart song road event.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to miss them.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
The two times that
I missed them,

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:84%
one was I just couldn't
get it together.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And the second time
was I was in Europe

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:90%
at the European gathering.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I didn't
really miss one that year.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy the camaraderie.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy that it's a getting
together of an instant village

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
to live in peace
for a whole week,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to touch on people and enlighten
people to be enlightened,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
to find a little
something that you need,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and go back home and be able
to get back into your routine

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and pass the love onto others.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
When the people that first show
up-- a lot of those people,

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:90%
they have no homes.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're on the road,
so they come early.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.115 align:middle line:84%
They need the assistance
of public assistance.

00:13:33.115 --> 00:13:37.602 align:middle line:84%
But when you come to a
gathering of 25,000 people--

00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how
big this gathering is.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard any size on it.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:84%
But 20,000, 25,000 people
show up in an area--

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
it's a microcosm of the world
at a gathering so, of course,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:84%
there are going to
be some bad apples.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all in how
you relate to them.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:10%
And to us, community
working together

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:10%
with the Rainbow Gathering,
will have Shanti sena--

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:10%
or peacekeepers-- in town
to deal with this problem,

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:10%
or whatever problem it could be.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:10%
And at the same
time, the community--

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:10%
it's a good shaking of the
hands and saying, hello.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the first gathering
I hitchhiked to

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
was in West Virginia.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I've hitchhiked
a couple of them.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:10%
But since then, it's a lot
nicer to bring a lot of stuff

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:10%
in the vehicle.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the earlier
days of the gathering

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
where it wasn't as
sophisticated as it is now.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The food-- there
wasn't as much food.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more workshops.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Or there are a lot of workshops
at this gathering right now.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten more
sophisticated over the years.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:90%
We have water filtration units.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
We've learned how
to make latrines

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.807 align:middle line:90%
that are private and clean.

00:14:45.807 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
We've learned about washing
hands in the kitchens,

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and washing our bowls
and forks and spoons,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and to make it a
healthy gathering.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
The setup of tents,
the putting up

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
with the tarps
over the kitchens,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
has really evolved into great
tarp buildings, [LAUGHS]

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:90%
practically.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I brought a friend this year
for the very first time.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And the most
amazing thing to her

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:84%
was the kitchens, and how
they build the counters,

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and how the structures of every
kitchen is entirely different.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.312 align:middle line:84%
It's a creative process by the
individuals that come here.

00:15:16.312 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And we all come
for the same thing.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We come to pray
for peace on Earth,

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and to communicate with each
other about these things,

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and to make new friends,
and to reconnect,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and to get lots of hugs, and
there's massages, and romances,

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and friendships.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And babies are born, and
we watch the children grow.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It's very nice to see the
young people that are coming,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that are carrying it forward,
that have put amazing kitchens

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:84%
together, and watch
the cleanliness,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and make sure they
feed the people.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And they reach out, and
they teach, and they touch.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So those that pass over
left a message behind,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's still going.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, there.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:90%
My name is Aaron Funk.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I am a ballroom dance instructor
and disaster relief worker.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And on my off time, I like to
come to the Rainbow Gathering

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and help facilitate
building a public forum

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a theater
for the open expression

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.407 align:middle line:84%
of the general public at
the Rainbow Gathering.

00:16:16.407 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, last night was
the variety show.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
You tend to get a
lot of the folks who

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
are professional musicians
from the gathering that

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
come through, such as
the Rainbow Gypsies,

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Fantuzi, numerous other groups.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But some of the most special
things you'll find on the stage

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
are things like little Susie
singing "Twinkle, Twinkle,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Little Star," folks who
have never in their lives

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:84%
gotten on stage in
front of anyone,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and getting a standing
ovation from 1,000 people.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
It's really the gems are the
little moments in between.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But there are some fantastic
performers, musicians--

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
everything from dancers, actors,
musicians, poets, everything

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:90%
you can imagine.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when we
come into the forest,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
we try to find an area
that's pretty thickly

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
laden with firewood,
which is snags

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.088 align:middle line:84%
and downed dead trees, that
could be of a fire danger.

00:17:10.088 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
We clear the mountain and build
many different structures out

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.425 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it, we either
burn it or clear it to the land

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
where it will biodegrade with
some speed and efficiency.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we move into an area
that's heavily laden with

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:90%
fire-danger wood--

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.655 align:middle line:84%
such as snags, downed wood,
dead drying from beetle kill,

00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.598 align:middle line:84%
And we go into it and
clear all of the forest

00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and then take down the branches
up to eight feet above, which

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
is similar to what used to
happen in the native times

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
before there was
industrialization

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:90%
and white culture in America.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:84%
The folks would come through
and collect their kitchen

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
wood, which would be all of the
downed things on the ground.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So when the fire
would come through,

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
it would burn just the
low-lying plants and bushes

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:90%
and keep the forest healthy.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, I-- as
millions of people around

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:90%
the world--

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:84%
watched the events
of Katrina unfold.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was very clear,
within three days,

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that this was an
extremely unprecedented,

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:84%
catastrophic event
in the United States.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was going
to take everyone

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:90%
to fix it, everyone to help--

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
many people
suffering, many people

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
displaced with no facilities
such as electricity,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:90%
running water, communications.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that
the Rainbow Family

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
are experts in feeding mass
populaces of people with little

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
to no resources in
remote locations.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So we made the call, had a
loosely unorganized group,

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
got together, and went
to Waveland, Mississippi.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But the odd thing about
it was, when we got there,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:90%
there was maybe 15 people.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And we hit the ground
running, started cooking.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
we were more efficient

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:84%
than any organization
on the ground.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I dare say that,
but it's the truth.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.205 align:middle line:84%
So we went, and we
became just that-- one

00:19:03.205 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of the most efficient
operations on the Gulf Coast.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We were the first
operation to open up,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
feeding hot meals to the
public on the Gulf Coast,

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and the only one to stay open
throughout Hurricane Rita.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:84%
But really, the skills
that we acquire here--

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
from learning everything
from running water lines,

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:84%
doing medical, trekking
all of your equipment

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
in and building
your kitchens-- is

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you need to know
in the event of a disaster.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
To me, I see Rainbow Gathering
as a constantly changing thing.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It's morphed many times over
the 34 years of its existence.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So Rainbow Gathering,
to me, it's--

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I guess, what can you
say, a family reunion.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Many people come here for
many different reasons.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:84%
For myself, I find my
connection to God and the spirit

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to be internal
and very personal.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's not even
something that I discuss,

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:84%
but this is definitely
100% somewhere

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:03.197 align:middle line:84%
where I find insight and
relief into my spirituality.

00:20:03.197 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I would like to thank my creator
for giving us the opportunity

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to gather together
one more time.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I have great faith that
we are on the right path.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a bumpy road.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You may often find that,
when you take a journey

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and you want to be led by
your creator, it's not easy.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So just like to ask all
parties who come here,

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:84%
or see us from the outside, to
be as compassionate as possible

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.955 align:middle line:84%
and understand that we are on
the same journey as everyone

00:20:33.955 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:84%
else, just trying to get
through in the most peaceful way

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> How is being a Rainbow
not like a religion?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, first of all,
religion is more

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:90%
of a root-chakra, tribal thing.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's all
the fault of 9/11.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It's more about
belonging and that,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:84%
whereas Rainbow is more of a
personal spiritual journey,

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.435 align:middle line:84%
which is more like
third-eye chakra.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:84%
There are those who
their natural proclivity

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:84%
of trying to
understand something

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
is to see it and react to it as
if it were about tribal, if it

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
were about religion.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But Rainbow respects
all spiritual paths.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And there are religions here.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:90%
People come with their camps.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
At this gathering, there's
three Christian camps.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:90%
There's three Krishna camps.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:90%
There's two Hebrew camps.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a Pagan camp.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But the rule of thumb in Rainbow
is there's no proselytizing.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.210 align:middle line:84%
You respect other
people's beliefs.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't try to change
somebody else's trip.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can try.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's nobody
in charge here.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:17.953 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to--
your trip is allowed,

00:22:17.953 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:84%
so long as you
don't start raining

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
on somebody else's parade.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really wonderful

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
when you have our dinner circle,
where you can get anywhere

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.360 align:middle line:84%
from a couple hundred
to 6,000 people, sitting

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:84%
in a circle on the earth
to share a meal together.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are 30 different
kitchens providing the food.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
kitchens are Krishnas.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
kitchens are Christians.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's going
around just making sure

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:90%
that the people get fed.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what it's all
about-- sharing in the feast.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a Rainbow
Gathering really is.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a spiritual feast.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And the path of the spirit--

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:84%
it's not something that anybody
can determine for another,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The individual has to
decide for themselves

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:90%
that, this is for me.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.907 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.907 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
always-- in the world,

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
there's people that are willing
to tell you what to think.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But here, somebody can tell you
over the fire what to think.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's always just
your own conscience.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to make
that much of an effort

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to try to convert anybody
into anything here.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And if it seems like,
to somebody who's

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
never been to a
gathering, that there

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritual bond
between the people here,

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that's because it
seems like it's more

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
the natural bond of people
when they're empowered,

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.795 align:middle line:84%
or self empowered, to appreciate
one another and to enjoy life.

00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there's
a kitchen over here.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.370 align:middle line:90%
It's called Lovin' Ovens.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And these folks live
all year so that they

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
can come to the woods,
build a set of ovens,

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:90%
and bake food for the Family.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you,
when you're 25, 40 miles,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
50 miles from
civilization, and you're

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:84%
sitting out in the
middle of the woods

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:40.725 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night
with a couple hundred people--

00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:84%
some of whom you may know,
and some of whom you may never

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:90%
have known before--

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.782 align:middle line:84%
sharing pizza all night long
till dawn, that's just--

00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And these guys, they
don't just make the pizza.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
They'll send pizza
around the camp.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that you're
at info or you're at

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.973 align:middle line:90%
the comm, the medical unit--

00:25:00.973 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing some trauma,
or something like that--

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
this pizza arrives out

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:84%
of the night, delivered
with love and concern

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:84%
by people that spent their
whole year making sure

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that they could be here to make
pizza for the Family for free.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's-- then
they wonder why we come.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
That period of not
being in a place where

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you belong,
that period of feeling kind of

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:84%
like, what am I
doing in this world?

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It all just goes
right out the window,

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
because Rainbow itself--
being at a Rainbow Gathering--

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:84%
is the experience
of, it doesn't really

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
matter where you've come from
or where you're going next.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:10%
There's this timelessness,
this timelessness

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:10%
of the appreciation of the now.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And if a person or a community
doesn't experience anything

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:90%
else, that is priceless.
