00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: As China has begun
to open her cultural doors,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
we have been introduced
to fascinating

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
medical alternative,
such as acupuncture

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and herbal remedies.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Now another highly effective
treatment system has arrived.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It's called qigong, a 5,000
year old healing modality

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
which may soon change the face
of health care for Westerners

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
in the 21 century.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:84%
On the surface,
qigong is an exercise

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that builds the immune system
and strengthens the body

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:84%
through a series of
slow, yoga or tai

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
chi like movements,
performed in synchrony

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:90%
with deep breathing rhythms.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Upon closer inspection,
qigong reveals

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
itself to be a
self-healing tool using

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:90%
a moving form of meditation.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
The practitioners carry to
an intimate understanding

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of the connection with
nature, the universe,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:90%
and other human beings.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Realizing this connection comes
with understanding the essence

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:84%
of qi, the vital life
force energy that

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:90%
animates the human organism.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
According to traditional
Chinese medicine theory,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
qi is derived from the air
we breathe, the food we eat,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
in which we live.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Qigong is not limited
to a self-healing system

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
but is also a treatment method
for healing others on a body,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:90%
mind, and soul level.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Qigong's deep breathing and
gentle exercise techniques

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
improve our health by
vitalizing our tissues, organs,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and muscles, and bones,
relieving pain, eliminating

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
stress, and strengthening
our ability to emit

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.296 align:middle line:90%
qi for use in healing others.

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
In the past, qigong
techniques were kept secret

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and focused only
by martial artists

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:90%
and the wealthy elite of China.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Since the Cultural
Revolution, scientific studies

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
have shown qigong can be a
cure for diseases ranging

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:90%
from hypertension to cancer.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.805 align:middle line:84%
Over 80 million people
practice this health

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:90%
care system each day in China.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
For the world's most
populated country,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
qigong seems to be
the only financially

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:90%
viable health care option.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
For Westerners who was
searching for alternatives

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.742 align:middle line:84%
to conventional medicine,
qigong may be the key to a more

00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:90%
complete system of healing.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The result of regular
qigong practice

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.560 align:middle line:84%
is a peaceful mind, a healthy
invigorated body, and the calm

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
spirit that is more capable
of dealing with daily stresses

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
and disease.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:84%
This documentary will take you
inside the fascinating health

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:90%
care system of qigong.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
We will look through
the eyes of history,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:84%
exploring its religious
and cultural evolution.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And then through the eyes
of some contemporary qigong

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
masters, we will see how the
current trend in searching

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
for an effective, low
cost health care strategy

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.605 align:middle line:84%
is helping to create
a place for qigong

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:84%
in our future, a future
that puts health care back

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
in the hands of the individual.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Not all Chinese
accept the claims of qigong

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:90%
on face value.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
To some, it's simply
an antiquated practice

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:90%
based on superstitious beliefs.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.582 align:middle line:84%
And in a country that is rapidly
embracing things Western,

00:04:40.582 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
the old is being discarded
at an alarming rate.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And what may seem
counter to this trend,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
teams of Western
trained medical doctors

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
are taking a serious look
at the potential for qigong

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
to play a vital role
in the increasingly

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
demanding health care
needs of the world's

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:90%
most populous country.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
In the heart of Shanghai,
China's largest city, Drs.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Wang and Xu have amassed the
most thoroughly tested data

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
in the world on the
effects of qigong

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:90%
for treating hypertension.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Their 30-year study
shows conclusive evidence

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.696 align:middle line:84%
that qigong can indeed
lower high blood pressure.

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:90%
DR WANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:10%
INTERPRETER: Our
physicians prescribe herbs,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.525 align:middle line:10%
lifestyle changes, and then
various qigong exercises.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:84%
We saw that blood pressure was
controlled and quality of life

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.534 align:middle line:90%
went up.

00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
According to traditional
Chinese medicine,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
different people and
different symptoms

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.995 align:middle line:84%
require different
qigong exercises.

00:05:51.995 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But all qigong systems
have three common aspects,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
regulation of the
posture for relaxation,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
regulation of the mind, and
regulation of breathing.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We think qigong cure every
kind of disease, some

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%
responding better than others.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Across town at the
Shanghai Qigong Institute,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:84%
government funded
research is carried out

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to discover how qigong
can be successfully

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
incorporated into the country's
social health care system.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.155 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sheng Kang Yi studies
qigong from a renowned master

00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
who lives far up
in the mountains

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and works long days putting
these findings to use

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:90%
in the clinic at the Institute.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:10%
INTERPRETER: The only
thing we research now

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:10%
is the effects of
qigong on patients,

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:10%
since no device can measure qi.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
We compare groups treated
with and without qigong.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And we see very
positive results.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.115 align:middle line:84%
It is this kind of research that
will help Westerners believe.

00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: In the
capital city of Beijing,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Wu Jin, a western
trained physician

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and a qigong practitioner,
heads up research

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
at the Xi Yuan Hospital.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Although our cameras were
not allowed on the facility,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Wu shares her
groundbreaking work.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.259 align:middle line:90%

DR WU JIN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:10%
INTERPRETER: After
you're working for years

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:10%
with many, many patients
at the hospital,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:10%
we have conclusive
evidence that qigong

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:10%
can assist in treatment recovery
of nearly every disease.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Post-operative recovery time
was shortened dramatically

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
in patients that used
qigong over patients

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that recovered with
standard Western techniques.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: In Purple Bamboo
Park, hidden amidst the hustle

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and bustle of Beijing, a loyal
group of terminally ill cancer

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:90%
patients has formed a club.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Frustrated by the
hopelessness they felt

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
from their Western
trained physicians,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%
they follow a technique
of walking qigong,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
developed by the
late Dr. Guo Lin,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
in hopes of reversing
their illness.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Master Li Xu Wang learned
directly from Mrs. Guo Lin, who

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
suffer from urigenital
cancer and was told she would

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:90%
only have a few weeks to live.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Guo Lin lived 20
more healthy years,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.524 align:middle line:84%
devoting her life to giving
hope to cancer patients.

00:08:41.524 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:84%
These club members have all
outlived their own terminal

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.265 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis by many years.

00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:55.562 align:middle line:90%

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The actually word
qigong was only coined in 1962.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But the principles
upon which it is based

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
are found in records
thousands of years old.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
In an ancient tomb, these
items are buried in hopes

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
that a deceased, a
wealthy nobleman,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
would have good
in the afterlife.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:10%
This tortoise shell has
survived nearly 3,000 years

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:10%
to tell us through its ancient
inscriptions that people

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:10%
of that time believed
deep breathing

and specific stretching
exercises would

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:10%
infuse them with
the energy of qi

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:10%
and keep them healthy and vital.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
These drawings dated to
be about 2,500 years old,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%
show ancient doayin movements.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
They're part of a
stylized tribal dance

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that helped alleviate
aches and pains,

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
presumably from
rheumatoid arthritis that

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
was common with workers
in the rice paddies

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:90%
and in other damp conditions.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
These dances were
eventually broken down

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
into specific moves
that are prescribed

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:90%
for different ailments.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Another way that the
principles of deep breathing

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.055 align:middle line:84%
and mobilizing internal
energy was applied

00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
was in the area of
military battle.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Systems like wuji qigong
trace their origins

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
to secret techniques and
exercises coveted by warriors

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.465 align:middle line:90%
to make them better soldiers.

00:10:22.465 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.700 align:middle line:84%
At the Shaolin Temple, a
reviewed 1,500 year old

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist stronghold in Henan
Province, the gentle monks

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
eventually became
known across the nation

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
for their extraordinary
skills in battle.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Originally, this Chan
sect of Buddhists,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
we are more familiar with this
Japanese offshoot known as Zen,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
live ascetic lives and consume
their time in deep sedentary

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.790 align:middle line:84%
meditation on the Buddha,
a qigong that focused

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.491 align:middle line:90%
on building a strong spirit.

00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:10%
SHI DE REN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:10%
INTERPRETER: The average man
thinks of so many things.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:10%
He must sit and not
think of anything

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:10%
if he is to be truly healthy.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're sick, don't think
of it or identify with it.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Sit and meditate, relax, take
your mind off the sickness.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything belongs to qigong.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
If I return to the natural
time and world, I will be free.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Just like a point has three
world coordinates, if I'm free,

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.445 align:middle line:84%
I can move into
unlimited time and space.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: In 515 AD,
the Indian holy man

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Bodhidharma happened upon the
temple after a long journey.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
He climbed to the
top of Song Mountain

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and for nine years remained
in seclusion inside the cave.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
When he emerged, he began
to teach the Shaolin monks

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
a complete system of
movement based on the way

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:90%
animals move in nature.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
He frowned their sitting
qigong meditation,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
speaking of how to
qi became stagnant

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and how this would
lead to ill health.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
His forms became the foundation
of the Shaolin Kung Fu fighting

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
style that brought notoriety and
political favor to the temple.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The core of the
fighting techniques

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
lie in qigong breathing and
energy focusing principles.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Bodhidharma, coming from
India, brought ancient Hindu

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:90%
yoga techniques with him.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that
some of these premises

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
are incorporated
into Chinese qigong.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of qigong styles
developed over the millennia.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Some evolving into formalized
routines that have become

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:90%
known as Tai Chi.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Qigong is considered
the core of both Tai

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.976 align:middle line:90%
Chi and the martial arts.

00:13:01.976 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Its fundamental
premise is to use

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
the address to
focus and mobilize

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:90%
energy throughout the body.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Another influence on the
development of qigong in China

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:90%
was Daoism.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Daoism is an ancient
philosophical belief system

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
with roots that go
back thousands of years

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:84%
to the writings of the
Chinese sage, named Lao Tzu.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Lao Tzu and his
students lived in a time

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:90%
of great social unrest in China.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
They promoted a
balanced lifestyle that

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
adhered to the laws of nature.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Observing the world
around them, Daoists

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:84%
believed that their actions
should harmonize with nature,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the way
water flows gently

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
around obstructions or the way
willows bend in the breeze.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Their ceremonies
honor various spirits

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.975 align:middle line:84%
and guardians who are infused
with supernatural powers.

00:13:57.975 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Watching the activities of
animals and celestial bodies

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
became their inspiration
for living a virtuous life

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and would serve to create
a whole style of qigong

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that focused on balance
and building a strong body.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Dayan qigong, a Daoist
style performed here

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
by Master Fan Fu
Xing of Xian, is

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:90%
named after the big wild goose.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And its forms reflect
the natural grace

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:90%
at this beautiful bird.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:84%
As the goose is a
symbol of longevity,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Master Fan says that
this system will

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
bring the practitioner good
health and a long life.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Over 1 million Chinese
currently practice this

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:90%
400-year-old qigong system.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism and Daoism
are consider the two

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
pillars that support
the philosophy

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:90%
of the Chinese people.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Their combined
influence works together

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
to create a complete
way of thinking

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that has molded the evolution
of qigong over the millennia.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Qigong is more than
a set of exercises.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It is an attitude that works to
restructure one's perspective

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:84%
on life, leading to
balance and harmony

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:90%
with the world around us.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.468 align:middle line:90%

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: As the
Dao teaches, life

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:90%
is an ever changing process.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of this
century saw China

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.495 align:middle line:84%
in a state of moral and
social decay, civil infighting

00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and eventually war with Japan.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
The hope for a unified
and stronger country

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
led to the Cultural
Revolution, which

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
would dramatically force
people to reevaluate

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:90%
their traditional way of life.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Ancient practices,
such as qigong, which

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
were feared as old fashioned,
were outlawed and forced

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.131 align:middle line:84%
Many masters left the man,
as did the nationalist leader

00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Chiang Kai-Shek.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
For others the practice of
this ancient healing system

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:84%
stopped altogether, as
intellectuals, monks,

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and professionals were
persecuted and forced

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:84%
into hard labor on
farms and in factories.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
When the Cultural Revolution
came to an end in 1976

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:84%
with Chairman Mao's
death, China once again

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.805 align:middle line:84%
opened its doors to the West
and to its own cultural past.

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, it was
Mao himself who

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
instigated research in
qigong to test its viability.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Evidence was overwhelming
that this health

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
care modality would actually be
a great benefit to the people.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Its easy to learn techniques
and ability to maintain

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
health at a low cost brought
it great favor in a country

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.160 align:middle line:84%
with over 1 billion
people and a government

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
socialized medical care.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.060 align:middle line:84%
For this reason,
qigong has continued

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:84%
to be heavily
researched and promoted

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.560 align:middle line:90%
by the government of China.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.488 align:middle line:90%

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The traditional
method of learning

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
qigong is from a
master, a teacher who

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:84%
has experienced in
part the subtleties

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:90%
of their unique system.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
One of these great elder
masters is Duan Zhi Liang.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.415 align:middle line:84%
He has lived most of
his 90 years in Beijing.

00:17:47.415 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
His teacher, in keeping with
tradition, was his grandfather.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
His father was a guard
of the Forbidden City,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:84%
as was his grandfather
and great grandfather,

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:90%
who are both doctors.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
While they protected
the last emperor,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
young Duan played
in the courtyard

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and learned the
ways of the warrior.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The Duan family holds the
lineage for the wuji style

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
of qigong, which dates
back to the 8th century,

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
as noted in this ancient
tablet, located in Xi'an.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:84%
The tablet, known
as [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:84%

along the Silk Road

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and records the interactions
between the Chinese

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and Christians
traveling from the West.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Master Duan, like his
family, is a devout Catholic.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And his unique form
of qigong encompasses

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:84%
the Daoist and
Buddhists beliefs as

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:90%
well as Christian principles.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Although qigong
is not a religion

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and requires no change
in the belief system,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
the balance and peace
one feels after doing

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
these exercises will extend
to all aspects of one's life.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Master Duan, who has
been studying wuji qigong

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.500 align:middle line:84%
in martial arts since
he was seven years old,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is a doctor of traditional
Chinese medicine,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
who is renowned for his
compassion and generosity.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
He typically charges 10
yuan, which is about one US

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:90%
dollar for a qigong treatment.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Master Duan incorporates
acupuncture,

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
moxibustion, and tui
na massage techniques

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:90%
with his wuji qigong.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
This means he uses his own
wei qi, or emitted energy,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to restore balance
in his patients.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It is believed that these
energy imbalances lead

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:90%
to all illnesses and ailments.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%
As with all great
qigong masters,

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the power of their balanced
qi and what they collect

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:84%
from nature actually
catalyzes and promotes

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.225 align:middle line:90%
healing in their patients.

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:84%
To build up his own qi
and to maintain his health

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and mental balance, Master
Duan practices wuji qigong

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:90%
for one hour each morning.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:84%
This is followed by a strenuous
Kung Fu workout, where

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
this 90-year-old
master routinely

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
spars with other masters
and students 1/3 his age.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Master Duan's wuji qigong
is an easy to learn

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:84%
system that is comprised
of 18 individual forms.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Each form is
designed to energize

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
different internal organs
and promote qi energy

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:90%
flow throughout the body.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Stretching in various
ways both loosens

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
the muscles and tendons,
while stimulating

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%
the 12 acupuncture meridians.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:84%
This helps to
unlock stagnant qi,

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:84%
believed to be the root of
physical and mental problems.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Wuji qigong has its
roots in sword fighting,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:90%
the Duan family specialty.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Most of the moves are focused on
loosening up and strengthening

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
the shoulders, neck, and wrists,
keys to winning in battle,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and coincidentally,
key trouble spots

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:90%
for modern day computer users.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, Master Duan believes
one cannot be a good fighter

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:90%
without being a good healer.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
On the battlefield,
a warrior must

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
be adept at tending to
his own wounds and those

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:90%
of his fellow soldiers.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The powerful
techniques of qigong

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
were thus coveted
as secret knowledge,

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
since holding this
information meant

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:90%
having the competitive edge.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Even with his deep honor
of traditional ways,

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Master Duan's magic lies in
his incredible flexibility.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
His openness to new ideas and
willingness to grow and learn

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:84%
is what he says keeps
him young at heart.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
It is also the essence
of his qigong teacher.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Master Duan believes
that practicing

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the slow and specific
moves of qigong

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
helps us to remember
that we are all

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
connected through a singular,
infinite energy, he call wuji.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
He believes that understanding
the concept of chaos in nature

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.016 align:middle line:84%
will help us with
all we encounter.

00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
MASTER DUAN ZHI LIANG:
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:10%
INTERPRETER: The essence
of all evolution in nature

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:10%
emerges from chaos.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:10%
By understanding the infinite
energy that is always

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.850 align:middle line:10%
available to us, we
can flow naturally

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:10%
with the chaotic
rhythms of the universe.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Try to avoid patterns
and repetition,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:84%
mix things up, and
let qi flow smoothly.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Remain flexible and
relax in all you do.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.235 align:middle line:84%
This is to truly
understand qigong.

00:22:36.235 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Master Duan

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
the deep and synchronized
breathing of qigong

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:84%
connects us to the
original breath

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:90%
that created the universe.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:84%
A true master, Duan Zhi Liang
is consumed with his passion.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
He teaches constantly
at parks around the city

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and has recently started
teaching foreign doctors.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
His wife a 45 years works with
him, as she is also a well

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:90%
respected teacher and healer.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The balance of this time is
spent treating patients in one

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
of his two simple
qigong clinics,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:84%
located in impoverished
neighborhoods in Beijing.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
He chooses to share
his vast knowledge

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
with a wonderful sense
of humor and joy.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:90%

NARRATOR: On the
outskirts of Beijing

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is a unique clinic, specializing
in bone setting, of what we

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:84%
may think of as a combination
of chiropractic and physical

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a family-run
business founded

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:84%
by the 92-year-old Master Luo,
a matriarch of a healing dynasty

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:90%
that spans five generations.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Dozens of family
members work together.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.845 align:middle line:84%
Her son, the clinic's director,
is a western trained physician

00:24:01.845 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:90%
and a qigong master himself.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Master Luo practices a
unique style of qigong

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that focuses on using
qi in conjunction

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
with subtle bone
manipulations to cure

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:84%
An average of 80 patients come
to this little clinic each day.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Master Luo charges a
dollar or two per treatment

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and still uses the same little
stick to transmit qi, as she

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:90%
has for the past 70 years.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:90%

Some are poo.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
But you must treat
them the same way.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:84%

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I've used my big finger
for more than 70 years.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:90%
It is very important.

Surgery causes much
discomfort in a patient.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:90%
We use those techniques.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:84%
If Eastern is
correct, we use that.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Qigong is useful in
treatment and in reducing

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:90%
the recovery time.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Traditional Chinese
medicine says

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that if the acupuncture
meridians move slowly,

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:90%
then things are not well.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
The patient gets
painful sensations.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Qi must move
through the meridian

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:90%
smoothly in order to heal.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And this theory applies to
bone-related diseases as well.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%

of the Luo family

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
philosophy is a
desire to help us.

one's heart needs to be.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
INTERPRETER: The force from
the heart can do many things.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Many forces come
from the inside,

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:90%
not only physical strength.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.145 align:middle line:84%
I may be 92, but I'm
still very forceful.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:84%
We must do good things for
the people, nothing bad.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:90%
This is a socialist after all.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: To Master
Luo, qigong is a process

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of acting from a pure heart,
of caring about others,

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and visualizing wholeness
and good health.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.710 align:middle line:84%
She is an example of
charity and compassion,

and revered for both
her own healing powers

and the qigong techniques
that she has passed

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:84%
onto her family and
students so that others

NARRATOR: Dr. Wan Su
Jian is a unique example

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.005 align:middle line:84%
of a new generation
of qigong masters

00:28:45.005 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:90%
to emerge in modern China.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:84%
At 43 years old,
Master Wan has been

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
studying qigong and traditional
Chinese medicine for 36 years.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
His mother is a
renowned acupuncturist

when he was only seven

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and who is now considered
one of the most respected

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.310 align:middle line:90%
qigong doctors in the country.

over the world for treatment
plan, sometimes nearly dying.

00:29:32.955 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:84%
How great it is that
we can take ideas

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
from the Chinese traditional
I Ching and bagua that

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:84%
are thousands of years
old and use them to keep

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:90%
us in good health today.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
We must continue to do
research, though, to constantly

00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.635 align:middle line:90%
improve on the past.

00:29:59.635 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.330 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: In his own clinic
and training facility nestled

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
in the outskirts of
Beijing, Master Wan

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:84%
has created a
learning environment

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
where young students can take
up qigong as a vocational skill.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Some 40 students at a time
are under his tutelage,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:84%
following the age old tradition
of learning from a master

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.920 align:middle line:84%
but with the added
practicality of job placement.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The prerequisite
for these student

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.710 align:middle line:84%
is three years of study
at a Shaolin temple, where

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
their strenuous, around
the clock training

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:84%
brings them discipline
in the fundamentals

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:90%
of qigong and Kung Fu.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
As many of the students
arrive here at age 15,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
it means their family send them
to Shaolin at the age of 11

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:84%
or 12, taking them out of
a traditional schooling

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and into this live-in,
learning environment.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
What these young people lack
in geometry and science,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:84%
they more than make up with
practical medical training

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and an inner strength
and humbleness one rarely

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:90%
sees in their generation.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Master Wan, a father
himself with the state limit

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:90%
of one child, is a born leader.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
He has served 30
years in the Red Army,

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:84%
rising high in the ranks, while
pursuing his medical career.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.870 align:middle line:84%
His strength at
qigong brought him

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:84%
notoriety and freedom within
the military establishment.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.695 align:middle line:84%
And he was given his
own qigong hospital.

00:31:27.695 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:84%
He has now created a unique
training facility with patients

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:38.340 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world are
treated as his reputation

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:90%
as a healer continues to rise.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Master Wan combines an ancient
Daoist qigong system, called

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Bagua Xundoa Gong with
traditional Chinese medicine

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:84%
to achieve his great
success with paralysis,

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:84%
cancer patients, and a
wide variety of diseases.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.790 align:middle line:84%
This system of qigong
utilizes the practitioner's

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.755 align:middle line:84%
emitted weiqi to affect that
qi field of the patient.

00:32:10.755 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The qigong practitioners help
to restore a healthy balance

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
by moving their hands
in a specific way

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.445 align:middle line:90%
around the patient.

00:32:23.445 --> 00:32:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It is believed that everyone has
a qi around and through them.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The proper manipulation
of this field

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.810 align:middle line:84%
is a step in the
process of healing.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:84%
This manipulation is done by
the passing of the practitioners

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.750 align:middle line:84%
hand through this
field in helping

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.870 align:middle line:84%
to bring about a shift
and a restructuring of qi,

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:84%
while infusing them
with qi from nature.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Some practitioners seem to have
better success than others.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And Master Wan's unique style
of having several qigong doctors

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:84%
working on a single
patient has proven

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.805 align:middle line:84%
to bring about profound
and lasting results.

00:33:04.805 --> 00:33:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.060 align:middle line:84%
He continually
explores new techniques

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and combines them with
is emitted qi treatments.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Like all qigong masters,
Dr. Wan practices

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.890 align:middle line:84%
inner and other
exercises to replenish

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and strengthened his qi.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:84%
The strenuous regiment he
puts his students through

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:44.300 align:middle line:84%
has helped to create a powerful
team of young qigong masters.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:84%
He constantly lectures
on the importance

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:84%
of this self-discipline, not
only for the practitioner,

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:90%
but also for the patient.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:84%
A major key in
successful qigong healing

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is followup practice by a
patient after their treatment.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is what he attributes
to his high success rate.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Master Wan's Japanese patients
have created rehabilitation

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.080 align:middle line:84%
groups where they
loyally practice

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
qigong exercises
after they return home

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:90%
from their week-long treatment.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
As Daoist, Master
Wan's qigong training

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.730 align:middle line:84%
emphasizes a
connection with nature,

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:84%
gathering yin qi from the
Earth and yang qi from the sky.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:31.320 align:middle line:84%
He teaches that this balance of
yin and yang from the universe

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.120 align:middle line:84%
around us reflects inner balance
that we need in order to heal.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Healing in the qigong philosophy
is not only of the body

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:90%
but also the mind and spirit.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
These three aspects
of our nature

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
are inseparable and, thus, must
be treated as a coherent whole.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.949 align:middle line:84%
Like Master Duan and
Master Luo, Master Wan

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:84%
lives by the philosophy
that compassion

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and virtue are the
keys to a healthy life

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and to success as a healer.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Money should never be
a motivating force,

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.360 align:middle line:90%
as it will only weaken your qi.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:84%
They all believe
that if you follow

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.740 align:middle line:84%
the path of a virtuous
life, and a life of balance,

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:84%
you will be provided for in
ways that are best suited

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:90%
for your unfolding and growth.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.106 align:middle line:90%

NARRATOR: Qigong has also
captured the interest

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.680 align:middle line:90%
of the scientific community.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Their hope is to
somehow quantify

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:90%
qi and then regenerate it.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:46.510 align:middle line:84%

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.100 align:middle line:84%
15 years ago, Engineer
Lu had the idea

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that the qi emissions
from qigong masters

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:84%
could be somehow
measured acoustically.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:84%
In the institute's
anechoic chamber,

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:84%
she suspended a highly sensitive
microphone near the Laogong

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:84%
point in their palms, a
traditional acupressure point

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:90%
where healing qi is emitted.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Upon demand, these
masters could emit

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:27.160 align:middle line:84%
a low frequency audio signal
in the 8 to 14 Hertz range.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a chaotic signal with
an ever changing pattern.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:34.870 align:middle line:84%
She tested many average adults
who showed no such pattern

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.640 align:middle line:84%
but did find that young
children exhibited

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:90%
similar audio emissions.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.370 align:middle line:84%
The result of this research
was the development of a qigong

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.850 align:middle line:84%
machine, a handheld
device that actually

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:51.550 align:middle line:84%
replicates this audio
portion of the qi emission.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Co-developed and marketed
by China Healthways in San

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Clemente California,
this device is

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:84%
used by thousands of
physicians and chiropractors

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.970 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

energy boosting, and the
reduction of swelling

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:08.920 align:middle line:90%
from sprains are numerous.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Although qi is
considered by authorities

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.880 align:middle line:84%
to be a more complex radiation
than just an audio waveform,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.740 align:middle line:84%
the qigong machine is an
example of what may lie ahead,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:84%
as we take qigong more
seriously and delve deeper

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.826 align:middle line:90%
into the mysterious nature qi.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper understanding

Dr. Kenneth Sancier, president

Institute in Menlo
Park, California,

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.690 align:middle line:84%
is considered one of
the foremost authorities

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:90%
on this field of research.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Now retired from is
35-year tenure as director

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Stanford
Research Institute,

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
his deep respect by the
international scientific

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:14.145 align:middle line:84%
community brings credibility and
objectivity to qigong research.

00:38:14.145 --> 00:38:16.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think we
have to look to China

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:22.810 align:middle line:10%
to find out what kind
of research is going on.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Over the period of since 1980s,
a huge amount of research

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.080 align:middle line:84%
has been reported
in the literature.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But that literature
is mainly in Chinese.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So in order to make
that information

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:84%
accessible to Western
people, the Qigong Institute

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.760 align:middle line:84%
put together the Qigong
computerized database,

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.550 align:middle line:84%
which permits people to search
with any keyword for a disease

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:90%
or any other condition.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're about 1,300
references in that database.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:84%
There's been research done
showing that the emitted qi

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:84%
sent from a qigong master will
increase the rate of growth

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:90%
of seedlings, mushrooms.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Qigong is a therapy for
chronic conditions primarily,

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:22.040 align:middle line:84%
although not exclusively,
whereas Western medicine

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.550 align:middle line:84%
is primarily for
acute conditions,

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:31.260 align:middle line:84%
like the surgery or bacterial
infections and so forth.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So these two can-- the Western
and the Eastern approach

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.475 align:middle line:90%
can be worked together.

00:39:41.475 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And they should
be complimentary,

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:84%
because they're dealing with
different aspects of healing.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.272 align:middle line:90%

NARRATOR: Most of
the exploration

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
into the healing
powers of qigong

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:84%
is going on outside
of the laboratories.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:84%
In parks throughout China,
over 80 million people

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:90%
practice qigong each day.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
You can witness the
myriad styles in any town

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and province you visit.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.390 align:middle line:90%


00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The therapeutic aspects
of this health care system

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.800 align:middle line:84%
are usually achieved through
slow moving exercises.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Yet some styles
involve simply sitting.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Others would rather
apply it toward what

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.295 align:middle line:90%
looks like traditional dancing.

00:40:37.295 --> 00:40:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:84%
From here in Shanghai to
1,000 miles away in Luoyang,

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.360 align:middle line:84%
massive crowds dance their
qigong to the guidance

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:90%
of a master instructor.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect of qigong lies
within Tai Chi sword play.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Like Master Duan, these students
believe the metal in the sword

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.390 align:middle line:84%
helps to absorb qi
into their bodies.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Most people may not think
of calligraphy as qigong.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But several master
artists are renowned

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:84%
for their healing
powers that they

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.970 align:middle line:90%
impart through their artwork.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.825 align:middle line:84%
There is a belief
that their powerful qi

00:41:21.825 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:84%
is passed into
the finished piece

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and can benefit
those who view it.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:90%


00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:84%
84-year-old Master
Lu lives in Chengdu,

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.510 align:middle line:84%
an ancient city near the
Tibetan border of China.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.250 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:84%
He sees the paint brush and
the sword as one in the same,

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.660 align:middle line:84%
as it is qi that
animates them both.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:84%
His grace and elegance
are the reflection

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.725 align:middle line:84%
of the refined qi he has
cultivated over years of study.

00:41:55.725 --> 00:41:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.460 align:middle line:84%
At Master Jiang's
Heavenly Dragon Temple,

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:06.110 align:middle line:84%
loyal students are taught the
subtle aspects of strengthening

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and applying qi to all they do.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:12.200 align:middle line:90%

in a deep qigong meditation.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.290 align:middle line:84%
A Daoist monk, he
lives an austere life

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:28.300 align:middle line:90%
in this mountaintop retreat.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.400 align:middle line:84%
He says that he never had
any artistic tendencies

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:90%
until late in his 80 year life.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:37.040 align:middle line:84%
One day after years of qigong
practice in one of the temple's

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.540 align:middle line:84%
gardens, he said he saw
the essence of the flowers

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in that moment and
deeply understood

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.740 align:middle line:90%
his connection to them.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:84%
He picked up a paintbrush
for the first time

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:90%
and began to paint.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.670 align:middle line:84%
His art is now considered
a national treasure.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And each piece he
finishes is carefully

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.305 align:middle line:84%
wrapped and ship to an
official caretaker in Beijing.

00:42:57.305 --> 00:43:02.770 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:84%
This Daoist temple is typical
in that all of the monks

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
are trained to apply their
qigong to creative outlets.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.830 align:middle line:84%
These monks, the Daosha,
are vegetarian musicians.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.720 align:middle line:84%
They play traditional
Daoist temple music

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.850 align:middle line:84%
in the heightened qigong state,
thus, imparting to the listener

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:24.250 align:middle line:84%
the strength and healing
balance of their qi.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.540 align:middle line:90%


00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:84%
A small group has been
trained since childhood

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.310 align:middle line:84%
to develop their qi
in order to perform

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.850 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary physical feats.

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Much like the Shaolin monks with
their acts of supreme skill,

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.130 align:middle line:84%
these young men focus
much of their waking

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.765 align:middle line:84%
energy to mastering
techniques that defy physics.

00:43:44.765 --> 00:43:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.610 align:middle line:84%
These feats are part of
their qigong training.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:01.080 align:middle line:84%
By learning to build their
weiqi, or protective qi,

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
they're able to strengthen
their bodies in order

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:90%
to master these skills.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.990 align:middle line:84%
These extreme feats serve to
inspire others to practice even

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:13.002 align:middle line:84%
basic qigong techniques
for self-healing

00:44:13.002 --> 00:44:14.802 align:middle line:90%
and general well-being.

00:44:14.802 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.020 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet, qigong seems
to be incorporated

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.210 align:middle line:84%
into the very
fabric of daily life

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:26.510 align:middle line:90%
for these gentle Buddhists.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
When we think of
this country, we

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.130 align:middle line:84%
are reminded of the austere
life of the monks who

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:84%
live in the few
remaining temples

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.900 align:middle line:90%
throughout this magical land.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Their qigong is
practiced in prayer,

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:42.726 align:middle line:84%
mostly performed in silence
with gentle chanting.

00:44:42.726 --> 00:44:47.500 align:middle line:84%
For the Tibetans, the use of
repetitive sounds, or mantras,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:53.100 align:middle line:84%
is key to obtaining the
healing benefits of qigong.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
The average Tibetan journeys
to a temple each week

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and walks around and around
it, chanting a specific mantra.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Coming on horseback or by foot
for miles on severe terrain,

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan knows the value of
this walking qigong practice.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.200 align:middle line:84%
To these spiritual people,
each moment of every day

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.980 align:middle line:84%
is an opportunity to honor
life, to appreciate the beauty

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and power of the
universe, and to accept

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.600 align:middle line:84%
all that comes to them with
an open and loving heart.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Within China, like all growing
industrialized countries,

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.390 align:middle line:84%
there is a major concern
about managing the health

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.160 align:middle line:90%
care needs of the people.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:84%
As in the West, rising
health care costs

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
are presenting a
tremendous financial burden

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.210 align:middle line:90%
on valuable limited resources.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.970 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese government
has been looking

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.890 align:middle line:84%
seriously at the
possibility of qigong

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to relieve some
of this pressure.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.500 align:middle line:90%


00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Deep in Hebbei province,
Master Zhi Chen Guo

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:84%
has been developing a
qigong style that he feels

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is actually transcending
what we know as qigong.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:84%
His system is known
as Zhi Neng medicine.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.910 align:middle line:84%
It combines qigong with both
traditional Chinese medicine

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.265 align:middle line:90%
and Western medical theory.

00:46:24.265 --> 00:46:27.600 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:84%
2 million loyal students
practice it regularly

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:34.640 align:middle line:90%
and claim incredible results.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.500 align:middle line:84%
At his treatment center,
an 1,100 bed clinic

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:84%
is combined with
an herbal pharmacy

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and training center,
capable of handling

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:45.390 align:middle line:90%
5,000 students at one time.

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The select students that
are invited to come here,

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:51.430 align:middle line:84%
travel by bicycle and
bus from around China

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.700 align:middle line:90%
to learn from Master Guo.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.130 align:middle line:84%
They believe his
qi energy, combined

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.750 align:middle line:84%
with the various exercises they
perform for hours at a time,

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.630 align:middle line:84%
help in their
training and healing.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many come
here to heal themselves

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:07.405 align:middle line:90%
from all forms of disease.

00:47:07.405 --> 00:47:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Guo's system involves
both qigong exercises

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and various herb combinations
that he prescribes just

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:90%
by glancing at the patient.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:84%
With his team of doctors,
he's able to treat hundreds

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.110 align:middle line:90%
of people a day at his clinic.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Because of these
profound results,

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.270 align:middle line:84%
this low cost and
effective system

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:84%
appeals greatly
to the government.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Many Zhi Neng medicine
support groups

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
are growing around the
country and are overseen

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.470 align:middle line:84%
by the local government
agencies that

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.850 align:middle line:84%
are proud of the responsibility
individuals are taking

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to maintain their health.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Master Guo is now
hoping to share

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.980 align:middle line:90%
his system with Westerners.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.710 align:middle line:84%
To this end, he has selected a
renowned Chinese medical doctor

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.020 align:middle line:84%
to be his representative
in the West.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.310 align:middle line:84%
This man, Dr. Zhi
Gang Sha is both

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.640 align:middle line:84%
a Western-trained
physician, as well as

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.600 align:middle line:84%
a traditional Chinese doctor,
who's taught in Beijing

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.490 align:middle line:84%
at the World Health
Organization's

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:90%
international medical center.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sha, a qigong
master, who began

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.980 align:middle line:84%
his training at the
age of 7, is now

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.200 align:middle line:90%
the adopted son of Master Guo.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Has been given
the responsibility

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:28.070 align:middle line:84%
of spreading the healing
power of Zhi Neng medicine

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to the West.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.855 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sha has moved to Canada and
has recently visited America

00:48:33.855 --> 00:48:37.320 align:middle line:84%
to begin this process of
teaching what he and Master Guo

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.450 align:middle line:84%
feel will be the
force of self-healing

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.890 align:middle line:90%
for the 21st century.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The system utilizes special
sounds and hand positioning

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to help unblock stagnant qi
that causes chronic pain.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:56.700 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.640 align:middle line:84%
For difficult cases, he uses a
unique form of acupuncture that

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.750 align:middle line:90%
utilizes only 12 acupoints.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sha inserts the
needles very quickly,

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.505 align:middle line:84%
but says he uses his qi to
enhance the healing effects.

00:49:10.505 --> 00:49:13.220 align:middle line:90%


00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.470 align:middle line:84%
The claims of his healing
abilities and those

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.830 align:middle line:84%
are the various Zhi Neng
medicine techniques grow daily.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And Western physicians
are beginning

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.220 align:middle line:84%
to take a serious look
at how these new healing

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.810 align:middle line:84%
modalities may eventually
complement Western medicine.

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:31.274 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.274 --> 00:49:34.746 align:middle line:90%

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:48.140 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Qigong, the 5,000
year old healing modality,

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:52.010 align:middle line:84%
has evolved and adapted
itself to the times,

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:84%
continuously molded by
its various teachers.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Although thousands
of different styles

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:02.480 align:middle line:84%
have emerged over the
millennia, the common threads

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the tie sincere proponents
of this healing system

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.400 align:middle line:90%
together remain the same.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:14.210 align:middle line:90%
The first key is the breath.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Every form of qigong
puts great emphasis

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:84%
on deep, diaphragmatic
breathing.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Though there may
be many techniques

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate the
breath, the fact

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.730 align:middle line:84%
remains that if one can devote
some attention to focused

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:31.410 align:middle line:84%
yet relaxed deep breathing,
they will experience

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:33.320 align:middle line:90%
a certain level of benefit.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.340 align:middle line:84%
As relaxation relieves
a body of stress,

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.370 align:middle line:84%
the immune system
has less work to do

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and more energy can be
devoted to staying healthy.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Intentional deep breathing
will also supply the body

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.530 align:middle line:84%
with more oxygen,
the fuel it needs

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.630 align:middle line:90%
to repair and maintain health.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.810 align:middle line:90%


00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The second key is slow, gentle
movement and stretching.

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:10.230 align:middle line:84%
With physical flexibility
comes mental flexibility.

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:13.580 align:middle line:84%
When deep breath is combined
with slow, synchronized

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:18.080 align:middle line:84%
movement, the body builds
more energy, or qi,

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.610 align:middle line:84%
rather than depleting
energy, which happens

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:23.390 align:middle line:90%
with strenuous exercise.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.590 align:middle line:84%
When the body moves
with the breath,

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:31.440 align:middle line:84%
many people experience a
sense of calm and harmony.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.810 align:middle line:84%
This sensation helps to bring
the body and mind into balance

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and contributes to our
physical and mental healing.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Qigong is not tied to any
religious belief system.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Although it has been
influenced over the millennia

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.260 align:middle line:84%
by much philosophical
thought, people from all

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.690 align:middle line:90%
walks of life practice qigong.

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It is common that practitioners
experience both a deep sense

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:01.670 align:middle line:90%
of calm and increased vitality.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.370 align:middle line:10%
Many say it has
changed the way they

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.740 align:middle line:10%
look at life as if their
senses have just been awakened.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:12.510 align:middle line:90%


00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Many authorities agree that
healing is heavily influenced

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.520 align:middle line:90%
by one state of mind.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.120 align:middle line:84%
It is thought that if a person
is more positive and at ease,

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.990 align:middle line:84%
they will successfully
contribute

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.870 align:middle line:90%
to their own healing.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Qigong appears to have
the potential of being

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:32.790 align:middle line:84%
a simple technique that
can be learned by anyone

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and provides tangible
results that even

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:38.040 align:middle line:90%
scientists can quantify.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Of great interest to all
is that practising qigong

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:46.300 align:middle line:84%
can cut down hospitalization
time and cost,

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.200 align:middle line:84%
reduce the amount of medication
one needs during convalescence,

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and promote healing
in diseases ranging

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.120 align:middle line:90%
from hypertension to cancer.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.980 align:middle line:84%
In a word, qigong
has the potential

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:84%
of drastically reducing
the cost of health care.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, qigong
offers a way for individuals

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:08.990 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for their own health

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and to alleviate the sense of
helplessness that often exists

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:17.605 align:middle line:90%
in today's health care system.

00:53:17.605 --> 00:53:19.620 align:middle line:84%
With health care
costs skyrocketing,

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.570 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese and a growing
number of Westerners

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:27.390 align:middle line:84%
believe qigong is an
opportunity for motivated people

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:30.660 align:middle line:84%
to become more involved
in their own physical,

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.200 align:middle line:90%
mental, and spiritual health.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Qigong may become a
powerful complement to

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.115 align:middle line:90%
our current healing modalities.

00:53:37.115 --> 00:53:40.060 align:middle line:90%


00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It is an ancient Chinese healing
system that honors the past

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and provides the
tools that can enable

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:84%
us to truly help
others and ourselves

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.700 align:middle line:90%
as we enter the 21st century.
