of Isaac Newton

that ripped us out of the

and created this
clockwork model where

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
mind is separate from
body, and that we

are separate from each other.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the model we have.

What's wrong with that
is just about everything.

decentralized.

There is no central

And that the brain is closer
to an antenna receiver.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It's closer to a transducer

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Through the history
of science, we've

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
focused on the
mechanical reality,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that the mind, which is an
energetic field of thought,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
which you can read with
EEG wires on your brain,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:84%
or even more interesting
is a new process called

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
magnetoencephalograph,
called MEG--

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:84%
well, electroencephalograph,
you put wires on the skin

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and read brain activity,
magnetoencephalograph

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:90%
is a probe outside of the head.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And it reads the fields
of neural activity

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.279 align:middle line:90%
without even touching the body.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So it basically says
that when you're

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:84%
processing with your brain,
you're broadcasting fields.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> 1875 to 1920 was
this enormous growth

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:90%
of biochemistry.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:10%
And it was then thought that
chemistry is probably--you

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:10%
know--

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:10%
we're a chemical machine.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:10%
The answer is to put the
right chemical in the body,

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:10%
and you'll get better.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:90%
To a point, that's correct.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't appear to be
correct for chronic disease.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:90%
It's correct in the short term.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
There was a major
intellectual split going on

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
at the time in physics,
because the old Newtonian

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:84%
world, the clockwork
universe, was going strong.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And a few crackpots
in Denmark, Germany,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and to a lesser extent, England,
developed quantum physics

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and said that it doesn't work
the way you said it works.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen like that.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And there were huge
anomalies found in physics

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:90%
that could not be explained.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And the upshot of this
was that the old idea

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
of a mechanical universe,
where everything

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
happens for a specific reason in
its own way, had to be dropped.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Quantum physics changed our
perception of reality over 80

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly, this
new viewpoint has yet

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
to be incorporated into
our current biology model.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:10%
>> The main problem with the
current biological model is

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:10%
that it's reductionist
and mechanistic.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:10%
That means first, it tries
to explain everything

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.879 align:middle line:10%
in terms of little bits.

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Generally, molecules,
because they're

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
the smallest things
in organisms.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, it tries
to treat the organism

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
as a machine that
works simply in terms

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:90%
of physics and chemistry.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Chemical reaction in the
body is supposed to be central,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:10%
and the main reason it occurs,
according to current theory,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:10%
is through molecular collision.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So that one molecule
collides into another,

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they
have this information,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and how we have a cascade
of chemical processes.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think
of the usual cell,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
a cell is like a swimming
pool, and molecules

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
are like a couple of tennis
balls in that swimming pool.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.794 align:middle line:84%
And according to this
theory, one tennis ball

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to
find another tennis

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
ball in this vast body of water,
and do so instantaneously.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is supposed to
account for all the millions

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:84%
of instantaneous activities
that occur in our body

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:90%
at every second.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's ludicrous.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The existing control system
of modern medicine is enzymes,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:90%
hormones.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Not consciousness, not
emotions, not body field.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
All that is there as
your control system

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:90%
is enzymes and hormones.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And we find this a bit
inadequate to explain

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.576 align:middle line:84%
the whole majesty of human
behavior and sickness,

00:12:30.576 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:90%
and the whole darned thing.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We look to science as
some sort of absolute truth,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and a story that's
already been written.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But the reality
is that science is

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:84%
a story told in installments,
and every new chapter

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes refines or completely
changes what has come before.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an intellectual
pendulum swing,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's swinging towards the
idea of holism and looking

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
at how an entire
system works together.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Whereas you say,
the doctors began

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
to look at how each
individual cell worked,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and they got down to
the cellular level.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
That's all been
done for 100 years.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:90%
We understand it a lot.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But we don't understand how
the cells talk to each other

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and how they deal
with information.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Today's medicine is all based
on a Newtonian paradigm where

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:10%
they haven't taken into account
the implications of quantum

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:10%
physics.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But once we start looking at a
different model of how matter

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
actually exists, it enables
the concepts of a body field

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and how information and energy
can actually control biology.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:90%
And that has huge implications.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was 15 years old, I
had a very serious motorcycle

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:90%
accident.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:10%
I was on a motorcycle I
shouldn't have been on,

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:10%
and we were hit by
a car that caused

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:10%
a very serious wound in my leg.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Ended up with 66 stitches.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
At the point of
impact, I clearly

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:84%
remember having an
out-of-body experience

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
where my consciousness
watched my body tumbling

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
through the air and
ultimately landing.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort
of shocking to me

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.090 align:middle line:84%
when I kind of came
back into the body.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
That said to me that perhaps
my consciousness isn't just

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
in my brain, but
that it is imbued

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%
with more quality than that.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And then as I was facing
a very serious outcome,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:84%
they talked about
the possibility

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
of having to amputate
part of my leg.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember laying with a cast
from my hip down to my ankle,

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about how
to rally my immune system

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
through my thoughts, such
that I could promote healing

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
in my leg.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I would lay on
the couch, and I would

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:90%
visualize my immune system.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel it tingling.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the healing
happening in my leg.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't come
from a medical family.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea at all
where this idea came from.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:90%
But somehow, it was noetic.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It came directly to me, that
that was what I needed to do.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, they
took the cast off,

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.246 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a two-legged creature
still, thank goodness.

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
there was something

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:84%
about my own personal
experience with that healing,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:84%
that there was something about
recognizing that my mind was

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
important to my body, and my
body was important to my mind,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.395 align:middle line:90%
that I just knew intuitively.

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Mind, intention, belief.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Can these factors
influence healing?

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:10%
>> If you think you have
an incurable disease,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:10%
if you think it
yourself, you are right.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:10%
If you think your
problem is curable,

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:10%
then you are also right.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on
your intention.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When you think about
intention, what is intention?

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And how does intention
play a role in healing?

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Intention plays a
role when you think

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
about how our thoughts and our
emotions and our cognitions

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
influence our immune system
and our endocrine system.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And we know that this happens.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We know that people who feel
a tremendous amount of stress,

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, have a
diminished capacity

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their immune
systems functioning.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:10%
It's been discovered in the
laboratory over the last 15

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:10%
or 20 years, for
example, that intention

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:10%
does have physical effects.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So for example, we recently
conducted a study where we

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
recruited couples, one
of whom had cancer.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And we took the partner
of the cancer patient,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and we trained them
in what we call

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
the compassionate
intention program.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they were invited
in to participate

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:90%
in a training program.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it had to
do with meditation.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It had to do with heart opening.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with
subtle energies.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And we took them through
this training program,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and then we asked them
to go home and continue

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
to practice this
intervention for eight weeks.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We brought them back and we
put them in our laboratory.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And we monitored the
patient in one room,

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and we put them in a 2,000-pound
electromagnetically shielded

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
room so that there was no
possibility of electromagnetic

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:84%
fields or the partner of the
cancer patient talking to them

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:84%
on the radio or on their
cell phone and saying, OK.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Breathe deeply now.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
We could rule out
any of those kind

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:90%
of conventional explanations.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the partner who'd
gone through the training

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:84%
program sat in another
room and watched

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
the image of their loved one
on a closed circuit television

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.790 align:middle line:90%
screen.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And then at random times
throughout the session,

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
they were asked to send
loving, compassionate intention

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:90%
to the patient.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
The idea was to see if we
could find correlations

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:84%
between the intention
of the one person

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and the physiological
activity of the other.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
What we found is that there
was a significant correlation

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
in the physiological
activity of this person

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and the physiological
activity of the other.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that there is
some way in which information

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.520 align:middle line:84%
is transferred that
isn't accountable

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
by the conventional Newtonian
model of cause and effect.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, the partner
of the cancer patient

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
wasn't coming in and whispering
in their partner's ear,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.735 align:middle line:90%
calm down now.

00:18:26.735 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Quite the contrary.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They were at a distance,
and there was no way

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that the two people knew
when this kind of interaction

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
was happening, and
yet it happened.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Sending an intention
that I am better,

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:84%
sending information with
belief that I am better,

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is sending information to
the body to correct itself.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Because as we say, a thought is
an actual, physical energy too,

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and it sends information
to the body as well.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been very well
demonstrated that our belief

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:84%
system affects how we
behave and how we perform,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and it also affects
our lifestyle.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't believe
that we can help ourselves,

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:90%
we probably could not.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
If we don't believe that
positive information is

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:84%
useful to our health
and well-being,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:90%
then it probably won't be.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Our thoughts create
our body moment by moment.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
When we think positive thoughts,
we release certain chemicals

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:90%
into our body.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
When we think negative thoughts,
we release negative chemicals

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:90%
into our body.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And those have a profound effect
on how the cells are behaving,

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and how the nutrition
is being used.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:10%
It's very obvious to me,
working as an osteopath,

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:10%
that the stress that
people hold in their body

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:10%
has various patterns according
to how they're thinking.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the most essential
aspect of healing is to believe

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in the modality you're using,
and to stay positive in some

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
There's so much evidence about
belief in a system of medicine

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
being crucial to the
effectiveness of that.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I used to say to
people who have cancer,

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
after researching the
limitations of things

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
like chemotherapy,
don't have chemotherapy.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:90%
It only works 9% of the time.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that anymore.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I don't is that
I believe that belief itself

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
is the body's
strongest medicine,

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and if you believe
something is going

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.260 align:middle line:84%
to work, regardless of what that
is, it's going to work for you.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:84%
There was a study in Houston
of some patients going

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
through a knee
operation for arthritis.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Half actually went
through an operation

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.110 align:middle line:84%
where they were worked
on for their arthritis.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.266 align:middle line:84%
The other half were
given a sham operation

00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
where they just opened the
knee, and then closed it

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:90%
and did nothing.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
They found over three
years of follow-up

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
that both sets of patients
reported having no pain.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So the patients where
nothing was done to them

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:90%
still reported being pain-free.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.859 align:middle line:90%
Their arthritis was gone.

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
There have been
other studies looking

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
at if there's any difference
between going to the gym

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about
going to the gym.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And with this study, they
took a group of people,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and they sent half to the
gym to work on their biceps,

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and the other half were allowed
to sit in their armchairs

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and just think about
going to the gym

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and working on their biceps.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And they still recorded
a very strong effect

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
in the group who had just
sat in their armchairs.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The couch potatoes still
built up their biceps.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So the body really can't
distinguish between action

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and thought.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And you see this most clearly
with the placebo effect.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Traditional Western
medicine typically attributes

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous or miraculous
healing to placebo.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But what exactly is
the placebo effect?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The placebo effect is
the fact that a belief that

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:10%
a person has can
override their biology.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's so
profoundly important

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
that science has recognized
that at least one third

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
of all healings, including
drugs and surgery

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and other allopathic
interventions, one

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:84%
third of all healings has
nothing to do with the process,

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
but has to do with
the placebo effect.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
That a person believes that the
process is going to heal them,

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and heals themselves in
spite of the fact that maybe

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
the pill was a sugar
pill, or the operation

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:90%
was just a sham and wasn't real.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And why this becomes
important is clearly,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
one third of all healings
occurs without anybody

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
doing anything other than
having a positive thought.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And what interests
me as a biologist

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and former professor
in a medical school

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:84%
is how we can talk about
the placebo effect for about

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes in a
pharmacology course,

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and then totally ignore
the relevance of thought

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and mental processes
on biology for the rest

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:90%
of medical education.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So that our doctors are not
really using the placebo effect

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
effectively, that we're not even
studying the placebo effect.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we could
cut the health care cost

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
by exactly one third by just
using the placebo effect.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems time that we began
to shift the lens and start

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:84%
really focusing on, what is
the nature of the placebo?

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:84%
How is it that you can take
an inert substance, something

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that has no known
medicinal capacity--

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
you know, potential--
and that inert substance

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:84%
not only can create
physiological changes

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:84%
in the body, but
actually somehow

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.390 align:middle line:84%
is able to manage a whole
cascade of responses

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
within a very
complex system, such

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
that it can target the liver
or the kidney or the lungs,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.170 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
That is a great mystery, and
we don't understand that,

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and much more needs to be done.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The placebo effect is really
another way of talking about

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
the body's
self-healing capacity.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And anything that
unleashes more of that

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.166 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a better system.

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.897 align:middle line:84%
>> I was absolutely
desperate to have children.

00:24:09.897 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the reasons
why I'd gotten divorced.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:10%
I wanted children,
and my husband didn't.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:10%
So I moved to London,
thinking it would take me

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:10%
a maximum of two years to
find myself a new partner

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:10%
and settle down, and I'd
be out in the country,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:10%
having my 2.5 children,
and I'd be totally happy.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:90%
That was my plan.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:90%
I was very good at making plans.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.140 align:middle line:90%
So there I was.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:90%
I had my osteopathic practice.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I was seeing clients.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was stressed,
frustrated, depressed.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had been having
headaches for years.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 10 years, I'd been having
these terrible headaches, which

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
were getting worse
and worse and worse.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they lasted
as long as five days.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I had a routine
visit with my doctor,

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.879 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor found
that my hormone level was

00:24:54.879 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:84%
very much out of balance,
and I immediately

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:90%
suspected that I had a tumor.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So I was sent for a
brain scan, and they

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:10%
diagnosed a prolactinoma.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge shock.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Huge shock.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Out of the blue.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And I felt at first, how unfair.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
I went off to the
medical library

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and started to learn everything
I could about this tumor.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered that it
caused infertility, I thought,

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.870 align:middle line:90%
that is so ironic.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in my body was
saying, I want children,

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and I had somehow
created a tumor that

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:90%
stopped me having children.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
There had to be some
reason for this.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:90%
There had to be--

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
this was too much of a
coincidence, I thought.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And I got very curious.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Because of my alternative
medicine background,

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I decided to treat it
alternatively rather than

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
go for the orthodox
drugs or surgery.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Ariel decided to utilize
neurolinguistic programming,

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:90%
or NLP, to approach her tumor.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So then I got into doing
NLP at a much deeper level.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Got through the master
practitioner level,

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:84%
came home, and was
totally inspired

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:90%
as to what I could actually do.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I started to really understand
what NLP was all about.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NLP is a practical
form of psychology,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
which starts from where you are
now and looks at where you want

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.560 align:middle line:84%
to be, and uncovers
what's in the way.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have, like
my five-day headaches,

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and you'd like to be without
a tumor in your end state,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
the journey to get from square
one to the end square is what

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
we actually start
exploring with NLP.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Ariel made some very
interesting discoveries she

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:90%
began working with NLP.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Now remember, I was the
person who thought every cell

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:90%
in her body wanted children.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered was that
deep down, that going back

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
to early, early,
early childhood,

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I had such an abhorrence of
what my family had been like

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that the last thing in
the world part of me

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:90%
wanted was to be a mother.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And this really,
really shocked me.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I thought I wanted one
thing, and in fact,

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:84%
an unconscious part of me was
going in a completely different

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:90%
direction.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I understood
the reasons

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
why it didn't want children
and what it was based on,

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I was able to kind
of let go of that,

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to be the way it
was, and at least understand

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
why I'd created a life that
didn't go down that path.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:84%
One day, I heard myself
shouting inside my head.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It was like this little voice
saying, I'm so sick of this.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be rid
of this whole nightmare.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I want to be rid of this tumor.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped in
shock as I listened

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.140 align:middle line:90%
to this voice inside my head.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:90%
And I went, wow.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of anger in
there, a lot of frustration.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of self-attack.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:84%
If I'm attacking my tumor
with all those thoughts

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to get rid
of it, that's murderous.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:90%
That can't be healing.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I had never looked
at healing in that way.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I realized then that
every thought I'd had

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
was actually about
making it go away.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a conflict.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge inner conflict.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to look at that
a little bit more closely.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, what
would be the opposite?

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.517 align:middle line:90%
It has to be acceptance.

00:28:31.517 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
well, what would it

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.720 align:middle line:84%
be like if I really
accepted this tumor?

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And this was quite
a few years later,

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
but it was absolutely a
turning point in my healing

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
when I realized that my tumor
had taken me down a journey I'd

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.320 align:middle line:90%
never planned.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It had taught me things I
had never intended to learn.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I had changed my career, I
had changed my whole outlook,

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I had learned lots of things
about myself and others.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I had insights I'd
never had before.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd met amazing people,
wonderful people

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd had the support of
people all over the world.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I liked
myself a lot better.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought, OK.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I can see that this tumor
hasn't been totally bad.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:84%
What if it has a purpose
or a reason for being here?

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.364 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, it's
done a good job so far.

00:29:30.364 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So if it's got a
purpose for being here,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.745 align:middle line:84%
and it's still here, maybe
there's still a purpose.

00:29:34.745 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.650 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
I gave it permission

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:41.165 align:middle line:90%
to stay for the rest of my life?

00:29:41.165 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It was six months after
I had that realization

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and I got to the
point of accepting

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the presence of my tumor,
I had my routine blood test

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:90%
and went to see my specialist.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise, my hormone
levels were completely normal.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And when my doctor saw
them, he just went, wow.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.464 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:30:07.464 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I thought
it had been a mistake.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe the blood test
reading was wrong or something.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you know,
so much time has passed,

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.579 align:middle line:90%
and I'm older now.

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe my hormones have changed.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no, no, no.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Can't be that.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, this can
only mean one thing.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Your tumor has gone.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this is
a real credit to you.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how you've done it.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you've been doing.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell you,
I've seen you for 10 years,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're not the same
person you were 10 years ago.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.045 align:middle line:90%
You are completely different.

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:45.695 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.695 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we make
an emotional shift--

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:10%
let's say we go from
frustration to joy,

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:10%
those kind of emotional shifts--

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:10%
about 1,400 biochemical changes
instantly go off in the body.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think about
the course of one day, all

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
the emotions that we feel,
the highs and the lows

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and the myriad of
emotional textures

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that occur through our
perceptions during a day,

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:84%
you can see that emotions
are creating lots and lots

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:90%
of changes in our physiology.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So it makes a lot of sense
to start paying attention

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to the emotional diet as
well as to the physical diet.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
keys to better health,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and certainly to slowing
down the aging process.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Strong negative emotions
just degenerate us.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Positive emotional
states regenerate us.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It becomes simple math.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Feel more love, more care, more
appreciation, and your health's

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.040 align:middle line:84%
got a better chance of
improving and staying that way.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most profound
discoveries made really since

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.335 align:middle line:84%
the advent of quantum physics
is a thing called the zero-point

00:31:54.335 --> 00:31:55.135 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:31:55.135 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And what this is is the
energy exchange that goes on

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:90%
between subatomic particles.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:84%
All subatomic particles engage
in a little energy dance.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like playing
a game of basketball.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:84%
They send energy back
and forth to each other.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And in that exchange,
a thing called

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.500 align:middle line:84%
a virtual particle
is created, just for

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:90%
less than the blink of an eye.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Now that little individual
exchange isn't much energy.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It's about a half
a watt's worth.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:10%
But when you multiply all of
the subatomic particles doing

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:10%
this energy exchange across
all things in all the universe,

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.530 align:middle line:10%
you come up with this
unfathomable amount of energy,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.160 align:middle line:10%
all happening out
there in empty space

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:10%
like some
super-charged backdrop.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:10%
>> While conventional biology
focuses on the material

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:10%
stimuli, quantum physics reveals
that it's invisible stimuli

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.740 align:middle line:10%
that are much more important.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a simple quote by Albert
Einstein that makes sense out

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:84%
of this, and the quote is, "The
Field is the sole governing

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.076 align:middle line:90%
agency of the particle."

00:33:01.076 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:84%
What Einstein meant
by this very simply

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.850 align:middle line:84%
is "the field," the invisible
energy forces around us,

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
they are the sole
governing agencies

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
of the particle, or
the particle's matter.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And so quantum physics says,
the character of matter

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.570 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately
determined by the field.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Healing occurs when
your body is able to access

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:84%
the information it needs to
be able to operate itself

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:90%
properly.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Walk into any great cathedral
in the United States and Europe

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:84%
anywhere that's been standing
for hundreds of years or more,

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and what you will experience
is in that cathedral is a hush

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:90%
of awe, reverence, quiet.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.588 align:middle line:90%
And it's a palpable experience.

00:33:44.588 --> 00:33:49.690 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Why is that true?

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:10%
It is true because
for hundreds of years,

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:10%
the people going
into that cathedral

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:10%
have been on their
best behavior.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.840 align:middle line:84%
They have been in
awe and worshipful,

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and in a state of mind that the
quantum emissions from the body

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:12.090 align:middle line:84%
brain are emitted
into that cathedral,

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
absorbed into that cathedral,
and fed back in later centuries

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to the participants
coming into it.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they feel
the sense of hush, awe,

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:90%
and reverence.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all part of
this giant energy field,

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
this zero-point field,
that we're all connected,

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and that we're connected
across the furthest reaches

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:39.701 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.701 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're
looking at the body,

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.447 align:middle line:84%
it consists of over
70 trillion cells,

00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and somehow all of them
magically know exactly what

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:90%
to do at exactly the right time.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And this actually cannot
be explained through normal

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:84%
biochemical messages or even
nervous system impulses,

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:84%
because the times involved
just simply don't add up.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.900 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
need the human body

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:84%
field, which is an
information-structured energy

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And a way of looking at that,
if we take the normal Einstein

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.390 align:middle line:84%
equation of E equals MC squared,
which means energy equals

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
matter times the speed of
light, what that is saying

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
is that all matter
is actually energy.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's missing one fundamental
thing, and that is actually

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that all matter is
information-structured energy,

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and that applies to biology too.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking
at the body, what is it

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that is actually coordinating
everything that's

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:90%
going around in the body?

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
information and energy.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what's
really crucial in how

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.760 align:middle line:84%
your body operates is to
look at the information

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.960 align:middle line:90%
and energy of the body.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Watch an ice skater.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.820 align:middle line:10%
There are things
that they can do

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:10%
that are not describable
in terms of nerve impulses.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:10%
Nerve impulses and
chemical reactions

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:10%
are too slow to explain
the subtleties of life.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Even now if you look up
the textbooks in psychology,

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:10%
in medicine, or biology, and
try to find out how the nervous

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:10%
system works, you're confronted
with the discontinuity

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.630 align:middle line:10%
of the system.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The nervous system is
comprised of neuron cells that

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:84%
carry electrical and chemical
impulses throughout the body.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:10%
>> If you measure the impulses
of the nervous system,

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:33.140 align:middle line:10%
we get some of them going
at 200 miles an hour,

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:10%
whereas other of them
going at two miles an hour.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think those are the pain
reflexes that are very slow.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:84%
How on Earth the brain or
any other part of the body

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:84%
can coordinate the nervous
system and your very fine

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:84%
movement when these
impulses are supposed

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to be traveling at
many different speeds

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.110 align:middle line:90%
is just an impossible problem.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're a dancer,
for example, we're

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:84%
moving in three dimensions,
and you're moving in time.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.500 align:middle line:84%
How on Earth that
person can coordinate

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
all of these important dance
steps is quite a mystery.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be impossible
with the contemporary model

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.090 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:84%
We need a field
theory to explain

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.700 align:middle line:84%
how the nervous system
in all its complexity

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.790 align:middle line:84%
can coordinate everything
that happens in the body.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>> We now know when you study
nervous system activity that

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the brain can start firing
synchronous pulses throughout

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
different areas of the brain,
virtually instantaneously.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.400 align:middle line:84%
The significance
of this coherence

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:84%
of these pulses that begin
to fire when actually

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is functioning
is when scientists

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
looked at how fast
you could coordinate

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.690 align:middle line:84%
all these different areas
that we're focusing on

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.690 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, that the
coherence of the firing

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:84%
was faster than the
physical ability of cells

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:84%
to communicate from
one area to the other.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So basically, these
results reveal

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is
communicating on a higher level

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
than through the physical
transmission of nerves.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:90%


00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> We're understanding that
the brain doesn't have precise

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:90%
addresses for certain things.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:84%
No one's been able to find
where memory is, for instance.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And Karl Pribram did some
amazing studies years ago,

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
horrible studies where
they taught rats certain

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:84%
runs, and then began
systematically destroying

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:90%
the rats' brains.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And they found that no
matter how much of the brain

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:84%
they removed, the rats might
have terrible motor skills

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:84%
from that, but they would
still, over and over,

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.465 align:middle line:90%
remember the run.

00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And from that,
Pribram understood

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't
say that memory

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:84%
has one precise address, that
it's much more delocalized.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, most
radically, that memory

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:84%
might not exist inside the skull
at all, but maybe somewhere out

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:90%
here in the field.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have
instead of this localized,

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:84%
centralized system is
much more of a paradigm

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.600 align:middle line:84%
where the body is
an interaction.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that ends here.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that ends out here.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And that we have an interaction
taking place between us

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:21.745 align:middle line:84%
and our environment, us and
the field at every moment.

00:39:21.745 --> 00:39:26.035 align:middle line:84%
>> I had an irregularity on
a kidney that was discovered

00:39:26.035 --> 00:39:26.835 align:middle line:90%
by an MRI.

00:39:26.835 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The physicians wanted
to operate, biopsy that.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to do that.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I had a healer, Adam, a
young man in Vancouver

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:84%
who was developing his
talents as a healer.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to work on it.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Over a period of a month,
we did that once a week.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Using just a photograph, Adam
can perceive a person's body

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
field in the form of
a holographic image.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:84%
He sees areas where the
energy flow is blocked,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
which indicates
illness or injury.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Through his
intention to heal, he

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:84%
manipulates energy
and information

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to clear these blockages,
allowing the body to change.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I went back and had a
sonogram made of that a month

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:90%
after diagnosis.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The radiologist examined
the data and said,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.100 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're
doing, keep doing it,

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that the irregularity
in the kidney is smaller

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:90%
and disappearing.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Went back three months
after that later in 2003

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:84%
after that, where the
total healing period had

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
been less than six months,
and again had a sonogram,

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and it was totally gone.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything was regular again.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Nearly all of the healings
that I have worked with

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.600 align:middle line:84%
had been remote
or at a distance.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.362 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't seem to make--

00:41:00.362 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:84%
the distance, as it
seems, have no effect

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:84%
at all, which would again
suggest we're dealing

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:90%
with a quantum phenomena.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The healer was in
Vancouver, British Columbia.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I was in Florida, the longest
distance across the United

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I've continued
then to experiment

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.990 align:middle line:84%
with different healing
modes for different things

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.820 align:middle line:84%
with different people, but the
mechanism is always the same.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:84%
There's information
being transferred,

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and there seems to be an
energy transfer as well that's

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.720 align:middle line:90%
palpable.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:90%


00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It now appears that
our bodies are connected

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to the field, but what
is the mechanism for this

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.960 align:middle line:90%
intercommunication?

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:84%
How can this
connection take place?

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.455 align:middle line:90%
One possible solution?

00:41:47.455 --> 00:41:48.255 align:middle line:90%
The biophoton.

00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Biophotons are weak
emissions of light

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.890 align:middle line:84%
emanating from the cells
of all living things.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We know we're sending out
information with biophoton

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:84%
emissions because people like
Fritz Popp have discovered that

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.060 align:middle line:84%
we are sending out
tiny currents of light.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We started to look
for these photons.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.030 align:middle line:10%
I knew from the beginning
on that it must not

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.500 align:middle line:10%
be very high intensity,
but it was clear

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:22.760 align:middle line:10%
that one should have these
photons at all in a cell.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> In order to detect
the biophotons,

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Professor Popp and his students
needed a photo multiplier that

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:33.010 align:middle line:84%
was so sensitive it could see
a candle over 12 miles away.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:90%


00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.550 align:middle line:84%
When a living organism is
placed in front of the photon

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.711 align:middle line:84%
detector, light emitting from
the cells can be observed.

00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We started with
cucumber seedlings,

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.490 align:middle line:90%
and later with other ones.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And all living systems which
we put into the instrument

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:84%
showed this very
weak photon emission.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Professor Popp theorizes that
these biophoton emissions may

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.560 align:middle line:84%
be controlling our
body's metabolism.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Molecules cannot
regulate themselves.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They have to have a
field, more or less.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.932 align:middle line:84%
So the photons
should be the carrier

00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of the information, which
is necessary to regulate

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:23.430 align:middle line:90%
the metabolism.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> These biophotons
create a dynamic,

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.590 align:middle line:84%
coherent web of light
within our bodies.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:33.760 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are
constantly emitting light

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.370 align:middle line:90%
in the form of biophotons.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Are these biophotons the
body's control mechanism?

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the function
of our DNA, our genes?

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Genes are not
controlling our biology.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.900 align:middle line:10%
When we get issues running
in families-- for example,

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.790 align:middle line:10%
cancer--

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:10%
we immediately look
at a genealogy chart

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.230 align:middle line:10%
and mark all the recipients
of this cancer running

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:10%
through the family, and then
turn around and say, look.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Genetics.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.489 align:middle line:84%
This is running in the family,
so there must be cancer genes.

00:44:06.489 --> 00:44:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> What they've left out of
this very interesting piece

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of research reveals that
when children are adopted

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:16.730 align:middle line:84%
into families that have cancer,
the adopted children will

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:84%
express the cancer with the same
propensity as any natural child

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:90%
in that family.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.169 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
fact is the child

00:44:23.169 --> 00:44:25.460 align:middle line:84%
comes from totally different
genetics that doesn't even

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.720 align:middle line:90%
have that cancer.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So it says, being introduced
into the family dynamics, which

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:84%
is where you learn perceptions
and beliefs and attitudes,

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.710 align:middle line:84%
is what shapes the
cancer, not the genetics

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.590 align:middle line:90%
that somebody came in with.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a new branch of
genetics known as epigenetics

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:84%
that addresses this
environmental influence

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:48.390 align:middle line:90%
on genetic expression.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Epigeneticists have
discovered that the information

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:84%
inside every cell, the thing
that switches it on and turns

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:03.380 align:middle line:84%
it on and changes things is not
inside the cell, but outside.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Signals occur outside
from the environment.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> A gene is a blueprint--
that's basically what it is--

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.330 align:middle line:90%
to make a protein molecule.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And the proteins-- there
are over 100,000 of them--

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.415 align:middle line:84%
are the building
blocks that give us

00:45:16.415 --> 00:45:19.700 align:middle line:84%
our biology, our
structure, our behavior.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So the issue is, we talk
about gene blueprints.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And up until the last
10 years, a blueprint

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.930 align:middle line:84%
was a hardwired
piece of information

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.030 align:middle line:90%
to make a particular protein.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The new science is
just mind boggling,

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:34.590 align:middle line:84%
because it reveals that
through epigenetic mechanisms,

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.770 align:middle line:84%
through the influence of
the environment on reading

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:40.580 align:middle line:84%
the genes, epigenetic
mechanisms can produce over

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:45.519 align:middle line:84%
30,000 different variations
from every gene blueprint.

00:45:45.519 --> 00:45:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
sudden, when you start

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that,
you realize, we

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.620 align:middle line:84%
have potentials that
are totally unlimited.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great
change from a belief

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.510 align:middle line:90%
that genes were deterministic.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Now genes are potentials.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.130 align:middle line:10%
>> If you just look at
the molecular level,

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.280 align:middle line:10%
the Human Genome Project has
revealed that we have about

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.840 align:middle line:10%
25,000 genes, far fewer than
they originally expected.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:84%
The Chimpanzee Genome
Project has now

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:84%
sequenced the entire
chimpanzee genome,

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:16.756 align:middle line:84%
and their genome is
virtually the same as ours.

00:46:16.756 --> 00:46:18.380 align:middle line:84%
They've got the same
kinds of proteins,

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.830 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of genes.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.920 align:middle line:84%
You can hardly tell
the difference.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Yet there's an
obvious difference.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't explain it in
terms of genes, what can you

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.640 align:middle line:90%
explain it in terms of?

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, I think,
morphogenetic fields.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Just as you can build
two different buildings

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:38.180 align:middle line:84%
with the same bricks
and cement, if you

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:84%
have two different plans, you
can build different organisms

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.900 align:middle line:84%
with different fields, even
if the constituent molecules

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.610 align:middle line:84%
are very similar, as they are
in humans and chimpanzees.

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The DNA is like
a library book.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.190 align:middle line:10%
These are all the possible
proteins from earthworms

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.020 align:middle line:10%
right up to us.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.810 align:middle line:10%
it's all the same
library, but you've

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:04.070 align:middle line:10%
got to know which book to
take out of the library.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the big
problem in genetics

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.040 align:middle line:84%
itself, is trying to
explain how the body knows

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.790 align:middle line:84%
which book to take out
of the genetic library.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And we think the
body field is what

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:21.840 align:middle line:84%
decides which piece
of information

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.060 align:middle line:90%
is taken from the DNA.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Many cultures of the past
have explored the energetic

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:90%
system of the body.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Today researchers
theorize that the body

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.760 align:middle line:84%
does have a field of energy
known as the morphogenic field,

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.560 align:middle line:90%
or the body field.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a hierarchy of
fields organizing our bodies.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.150 align:middle line:84%
There's the field
of the whole body.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:45.920 align:middle line:84%
There's the fields of
the organs, and then

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.378 align:middle line:84%
the fields of the
tissues, and then

00:47:47.378 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
the fields of the
cells within those.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Fields of our own body is
within and around the body.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.710 align:middle line:90%
There's an overall field.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
subsidiary fields,

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:02.421 align:middle line:84%
sort of modular fields for arms,
legs, and the different organs.

00:48:02.421 --> 00:48:06.670 align:middle line:84%
The advantage of fields is that
they're intrinsically holistic.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.470 align:middle line:90%
All fields are holistic.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.000 align:middle line:90%
The gravitational field is.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.310 align:middle line:90%
You can't slice a bit out of it.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.160 align:middle line:84%
If you cut a flatworm
into 10 different pieces,

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.380 align:middle line:84%
each part can grow
into a new worm.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Now how is that possible?

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.210 align:middle line:84%
If it was a machine,
that wouldn't happen.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:27.470 align:middle line:84%
If you cut up a machine, all
you get is a broken machine.

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you cut up a magnet,
a field system, then however

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:33.590 align:middle line:84%
many little bits of
magnet you produce,

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:36.800 align:middle line:84%
each has a complete
magnetic field.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was this analogy
with magnetic fields

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that lead developmental
biologists to suggest

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.040 align:middle line:84%
the idea of morphogenetic
fields in the first place,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and this was way
back in the 1920s.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And this field is
now a crucial concept

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.090 align:middle line:90%
in developmental biology.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:57.320 align:middle line:84%
You can't really understand how
organisms develop without it.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> All humans begin life
as a single cell that grows

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and divides, developing into
the various organs and limbs

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.340 align:middle line:90%
of our bodies.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.420 align:middle line:84%
How these cells
know what to become

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.390 align:middle line:84%
has baffled scientists
and led to the idea

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:90%
of controlled fields in biology.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>> We've already found that
there are different parts

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:22.610 align:middle line:10%
of the body field, some of
which relate to the muscles

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:23.956 align:middle line:10%
and connective tissue.

00:49:23.956 --> 00:49:25.580 align:middle line:84%
There's another part
of the body field

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that relates to the
brain and nervous system.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet another one for the
morphic field, which connects

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:38.150 align:middle line:84%
back to the DNA and the genetic
information of your body.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:40.890 align:middle line:10%
So it links up with
medicine in many places,

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:42.770 align:middle line:10%
so it's not different
from medicine.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:46.790 align:middle line:10%
It's just going a little
bit further conceptually.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> These energetic fields
may provide the information

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.000 align:middle line:84%
necessary for
controlling the body.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> How does the body know
to maintain its temperature

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:90%
at a particular temperature?

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:02.420 align:middle line:84%
What decides or
who decides what is

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be the correct blood
pressure for that person?

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying
as a holistic idea,

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.410 align:middle line:84%
the body field decides
to turn all the knobs.

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Informational health care
means that if we take the ideas

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.190 align:middle line:84%
of epigenetics, we're actually
able to take the information

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:25.830 align:middle line:84%
from your original blueprint
of how your body works when

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.010 align:middle line:84%
it's working perfectly,
imprint that information back

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:30.020 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, the body
starts to correct itself

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and goes back towards that
original healthy blueprint.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Morphogenetic fields,
or more generally,

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:84%
fields of information, yes, are
control systems over and above

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the molecular level or
the biochemical level.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They're systems that
organize the body.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.470 align:middle line:84%
They organize the
developing organism.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:54.165 align:middle line:90%
Plants have them too.

00:50:54.165 --> 00:50:56.790 align:middle line:90%
All animals have them.

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:58.830 align:middle line:84%
They maintain the
form of the body.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.250 align:middle line:84%
They help bodies to recover
from disease or damage.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.990 align:middle line:84%
They underlie
regeneration, for example.

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we really need
a field-based model of the body

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.530 align:middle line:84%
if we're ever going to
be able to integrate

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:12.360 align:middle line:84%
different forms of
healing or medicine

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.890 align:middle line:90%
into a coherent understanding.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The body field is
an energetic field,

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.020 align:middle line:84%
filled with patterns
of information.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.270 align:middle line:84%
All of the organs in
our bodies generate

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.790 align:middle line:90%
their own specific fields.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.510 align:middle line:84%
One organ in particular seems
to generate significant fields

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:34.130 align:middle line:90%
which affect the entire body.

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart is the
emperor in the system.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:84%
The liver and all the
organs have other tasks,

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.520 align:middle line:90%
but the heart is overruling all.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.220 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a concept in
energy medicine called energy

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:51.460 align:middle line:10%
cardiology that says that these
signals produced by the heart

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.150 align:middle line:10%
are all of regulatory
importance.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The heart is constantly emitting
sound, pressure waves, heat,

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:05.230 align:middle line:84%
light, electrical, magnetic,
and electromagnetic signals.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the cells in the body
are receiving these different

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:84%
kinds of signals
at different times,

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.120 align:middle line:84%
because they travel at
different velocities through

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:90%
the circulatory system.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:21.160 align:middle line:10%
>> The heart generates by
far the largest rhythmic

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.682 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic
signal in the body.

00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:29.100 align:middle line:84%
If you look at this magnetic
field as a carrier wave,

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.770 align:middle line:84%
it's being modulated
with information so as

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:34.170 align:middle line:90%
to carry away for information.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And the work in
our lab has shown

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.620 align:middle line:84%
quite clearly that
it's modulated

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.496 align:middle line:90%
with emotional patterns.

00:52:40.496 --> 00:52:44.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if we're feeling
angry or frustrated, irritated,

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.650 align:middle line:84%
the information
that's been imprinted

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:84%
on that magnetic field
is very different

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.500 align:middle line:84%
than if we're feeling
care or love or compassion

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.270 align:middle line:90%
towards that person.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:58.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The heart has been found to
have rhythmic beating patterns

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:01.730 align:middle line:10%
that can be incoherent
or coherent.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.820 align:middle line:10%
These patterns are closely
linked to our emotions

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.590 align:middle line:10%
and how we feel.

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.700 align:middle line:10%
>> When the heart's rhythmic
beating pattern is smooth

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.430 align:middle line:10%
and ordered, it's called
a coherent rhythm.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And that coherent rhythm
entrains or synchronizes

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:84%
the brain rhythm,
the nervous system.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:23.210 align:middle line:84%
The bodily organs and
glands all dance in harmony

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:25.700 align:middle line:90%
to that heart coherent rhythm.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Positive emotions, what
we tend to call positive--

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:32.780 align:middle line:84%
things like love, appreciation,
care, forgiveness, gratitude--

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.430 align:middle line:84%
all lead to a very different
kind of heart pattern

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:36.860 align:middle line:90%
than negative things.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Like if we're feeling anger
or irritation, anxiety,

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:43.010 align:middle line:84%
those create what are
called incoherent rhythms

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:44.760 align:middle line:90%
or disordered patterns.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.760 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, we
have the positive feelings

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.939 align:middle line:84%
when we're just appreciating the
sunset and how beautiful it is.

00:53:50.939 --> 00:53:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Our hearts beating out this--
what we call a coherent rhythm.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a sign wave-like
pattern that the heart

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.900 align:middle line:90%
is sending to the brain.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And we call it heart
coherence, because in research,

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.230 align:middle line:84%
we find that the heart has to
get into this synchronized,

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:10.520 align:middle line:84%
coherent, rhythmic pattern
of heart rate in order

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.190 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the brain and
the nervous system and body

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:17.330 align:middle line:84%
to entrain and synchronize
to that powerful rhythm.

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:19.230 align:middle line:90%
So it starts with the heart.

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> When we feel the pulse, what
we're feeling is the pressure

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:23.930 align:middle line:84%
wave created by
the beating heart.

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually
the flow of blood.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.109 align:middle line:90%
It's the pressure wave.

00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So every time the heart
beats, that pressure wave

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:84%
goes to the brain and
throughout the body.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
the brain level,

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.662 align:middle line:84%
that pressure wave
synchronizes all the neurons.

00:54:36.662 --> 00:54:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, the brain
would be in trouble

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.170 align:middle line:84%
if it didn't have that
synchronizing signal

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to kind of give us a global
synchronizing effect.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> When someone is in coherence,
you can often feel their love

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or their compassion or
their gratitude radiating.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Coherence is the optimal
physiological state that

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:56.870 align:middle line:84%
underlies learning and
performance and facilitating

00:54:56.870 --> 00:55:01.190 align:middle line:84%
the body's natural
regenerative processes.

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart has its own
intrinsic nervous system,

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:09.150 align:middle line:84%
which can sense, feel, remember,
and process information

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:12.110 align:middle line:84%
that's independent
from the brain.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> We always think of the
information input system

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:90%
as being entirely in the brain.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But we're now
discovering information

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that the heart receives
information first, and then

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.360 align:middle line:90%
relays it to the brain.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies have shown that
the heart responds faster than

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.480 align:middle line:84%
the brain to
outside stimulation.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the more recent
studies we did in our labs was

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:41.136 align:middle line:84%
looking at what we ended up
titling the electrophysiology

00:55:41.136 --> 00:55:42.580 align:middle line:90%
of intuition.

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was some previous
research that had been done,

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:48.100 align:middle line:84%
showing that the
body would respond

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.480 align:middle line:84%
in a way that would
predict a future event

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.440 align:middle line:84%
if the future event
was emotionally

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.330 align:middle line:84%
significant and
relevant to the person.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Participants were
attached to sensors to record

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:02.090 align:middle line:84%
their brainwave
activity, heart activity,

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.560 align:middle line:90%
and heart-brain interactions.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.607 align:middle line:84%
>> A person would be standing
at a computer, push a button,

00:56:07.607 --> 00:56:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and then we're recording
physiological data.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And six to eight
seconds later, you

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.400 align:middle line:90%
would be shown a photograph.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the photograph would
be from two opposite ends

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:18.680 align:middle line:84%
of the spectrum of
emotional arousal.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Participants were shown
pictures of car accident

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:26.300 align:middle line:84%
victims, snakes attacking,
and other disturbing images.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.890 align:middle line:84%
On the other end
of the spectrum,

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:31.460 align:middle line:84%
the pictures included
flowers or sunsets.

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:34.040 align:middle line:84%
The photographs were
randomly assigned for display

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.200 align:middle line:90%
to the participants.

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What's key here is the
computer assigned not only

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.940 align:middle line:84%
which photograph, but which type
of photograph after the data

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.210 align:middle line:90%
was already recorded.

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:48.785 align:middle line:84%
So it was absolutely impossible
for the research subject,

00:56:48.785 --> 00:56:51.499 align:middle line:84%
the experimenter to have
any kind of fore knowledge

00:56:51.499 --> 00:56:52.790 align:middle line:90%
of what photograph it might be.

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The computer itself
didn't even know.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> The results were surprising.

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:02.090 align:middle line:84%
The body responded even before
the picture was displayed.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> What we found was that
not only did the body indeed

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.760 align:middle line:90%
respond prior to the event--

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, seeing the picture in
a way that would predict it--

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.950 align:middle line:84%
but it was the heart
that responded first.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart's response
was not only faster,

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but the signal it is sent to
the brain varied depending

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.690 align:middle line:84%
on the emotional
content of the picture.

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking at the signals
that the heart was sending

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.210 align:middle line:84%
to the brain, that the heart
literally sent a different

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:34.630 align:middle line:84%
message to the brain depending
on what the future picture was

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:39.420 align:middle line:84%
going to be, then you saw a
brain response and you saw

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the body response, which is
where it then became conscious.

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So the flow of this
intuitive information

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.874 align:middle line:90%
is heart, brain, body.

00:57:48.874 --> 00:57:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to have
the body response for it

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.160 align:middle line:84%
to become consciously
aware of it.

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What these experiments
reveal is changing our basic

00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:59.880 align:middle line:84%
understanding of how the
human body functions.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears as though
the heart, and brain later,

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:06.715 align:middle line:84%
have access to a field of
information not bound by time

00:58:06.715 --> 00:58:07.515 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:58:07.515 --> 00:58:10.360 align:middle line:90%


00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.880 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking kind of
quantum holographics or quantum

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.490 align:middle line:90%
physics, that's old news.

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:18.260 align:middle line:84%
We're really starting
to have ways now

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of showing that
we really do have

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.020 align:middle line:84%
an energetic or an
electronic system,

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:26.090 align:middle line:90%
and that that's really primary.

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It's really not bound
by time and space.

00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart is connected
to a field of information

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence that's
different but complementary

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.934 align:middle line:90%
to the field of the brain.

00:58:37.934 --> 00:58:39.850 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very clear, these
neurons in the heart

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:43.880 align:middle line:10%
and the brain part have
short and long-term memory.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.540 align:middle line:10%
They process information.

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a functional brain.

00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Other researchers theorize
that the heart may be

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the master organ for imprinting
information into the body

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.620 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of neural
tissue in the heart,

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and we believe that neural
tissue is there in order to act

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:05.130 align:middle line:84%
as an imprinter
for the hologram.

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The body's holographic body
field is continually supplied

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:12.060 align:middle line:84%
with information via the
pressure waves of the heart.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Inside the heart, there is
an enormous amount of charge.

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Now the pressure
waves in the presence

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of this charge inside
the chamber of the heart

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.480 align:middle line:84%
is sufficient to
imprint information.

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> If the heart is transmitting
or imprinting information,

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:30.360 align:middle line:84%
there must be a way for the
cells in the body to receive

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.640 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.820 align:middle line:10%
>> There are receptor
protein cells on the outside

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:40.140 align:middle line:10%
of the cell, which is simply
there to receive environmental

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.250 align:middle line:10%
information.

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:42.570 align:middle line:90%
How is my day today?

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.220 align:middle line:90%
What is going on out there?

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:47.590 align:middle line:84%
What does the body want this
little cell to do today?

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:48.870 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:52.680 align:middle line:84%
There has to be
intercellular communication,

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:57.090 align:middle line:84%
but there has to be one source
so there can be one control

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:58.690 align:middle line:90%
system for the body.

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:05.970 align:middle line:90%


01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This control system is
sending out information

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to the body via the body
field, but what exactly is

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:90%
information?

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:19.300 align:middle line:10%
>> We think of the body as both
a material and an energetic,

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
dynamically exchanging
open system, which it is.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We need to eat, like, a ton
of food a year, and most of it

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.980 align:middle line:90%
is passed out.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So all of that food
is somehow turned

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
into the body, which
remains extremely

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:34.420 align:middle line:90%
stable for long periods of time.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Somebody basically
doesn't change

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
much for maybe 40
years as an adult.

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
People recognize you
immediately even 40 years later,

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
because the basic body
structure doesn't change,

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:45.950 align:middle line:84%
even though after a
short period of time,

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a single
atom left in your body.

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
They've all exchanged,
and gone out.

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:54.564 align:middle line:10%
And so now this is the hamburger
I ate yesterday, and three

01:00:54.564 --> 01:00:56.980 align:middle line:10%
weeks from now, this will be
a carrot that I eat tomorrow,

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.820 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a very dynamic system,
and yet I remain the same.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not the
material, and presumably not

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
the energetic part, the
dynamic, energetic part, then

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:07.300 align:middle line:90%
what's left?

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.820 align:middle line:84%
There must be something like
an informational pattern which

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.110 align:middle line:90%
holds it together.

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Many scientists who are on
the frontier theorize and have

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated that we're
an information system,

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's not entirely
localized in our body.

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
That we're accessing information
from the field all the time.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The body appears to be
constantly connecting with

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
information within itself and
with information in the field.

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:36.490 align:middle line:10%
The body is always looking
for coherent systems,

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.880 align:middle line:10%
looking for information
interchange between all cells

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.580 align:middle line:10%
it has, so that every
single cell knows what's on.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a large
information system,

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and some people say
that illness is just

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
a lack in the
information system.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And I suppose they are right.

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Matter is compressed energy.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Information is
patterns of energy.

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.780 align:middle line:84%
There's an information
flow in our bodies

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that we still don't
completely understand

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.660 align:middle line:84%
through our nervous system
and through the tissues.

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And even some of The
Ancients, the Chinese

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
called it the
acupuncture system, which

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is a system of information
flow in the body itself.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We get a system
when we get structure.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's information
everywhere, isn't there?

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.570 align:middle line:84%
You only get that information
system when it's ordered.

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing that
was discovered in the 1980s

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
was that the acupuncture
system appears

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.870 align:middle line:90%
to be an organized system.

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a random group
of acupuncture meridians.

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It looked upon doing
experiments that they wanted

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
to arrange themselves
in a certain order,

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and that they wanted
to communicate

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
with each other in
a certain direction.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're saying that
information has order,

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:01.776 align:middle line:84%
and that's what makes the body
field is the order itself.

01:03:01.776 --> 01:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The implications of looking
at the physics of the body

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and combining that with
technology is that more

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and more people are going
to be able to take control

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:10.825 align:middle line:84%
of their own health
care journey.

01:03:10.825 --> 01:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at
the past 100 years,

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
the control of people's
health has actually

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.230 align:middle line:84%
been in the doctors
and practitioners

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and directed what
biochemistry or pharmaceutical

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:21.040 align:middle line:90%
they should take.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But now as you're
able to work out

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in your
body and trigger a healing

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
response in the size of
something of your mobile phone,

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:32.189 align:middle line:84%
the power is directly being
shifted to the individual.

01:03:32.189 --> 01:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Now really, the role of the
doctor and the practitioner

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
in the future is to
empower the individual

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to take control of
their own health

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and help them on their
own healing journey.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Ultimately,
according to Einstein,

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and other people more recently
have said that energean

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
information must
be interchangeable.

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:51.860 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So information becomes
a type of energy,

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's an
orderliness in space.

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:00.520 align:middle line:90%
So they are interchangeable.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, in practice

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:05.980 align:middle line:84%
what happens is you
get a wave of energy,

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and then upon that wave, you
can get imprinted information.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
information you can imprint

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.430 align:middle line:90%
appears to be limitless.

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Informational
medicine, medicine that

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
takes information and changes
disturbed information,

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
future of medicine.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Apparently, the control
system of the body is not genes

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.900 align:middle line:84%
or chemistry, but information,
which seems to be available

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.760 align:middle line:90%
in the body field.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to put new
information into the body

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.950 align:middle line:90%
to affect wellness?

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:46.431 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly what a number
of researchers are doing.

01:04:46.431 --> 01:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we've learned how to stop
the distortion of information

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that occurs as a result of
various disease processes.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Once you stop the distortion,
surprisingly enough,

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.600 align:middle line:90%
the physiology begins to work.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.310 align:middle line:90%
The chemistry comes right.

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
There are really
wonderful healing stories

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.960 align:middle line:90%
to be told here.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply
because we've learned

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:14.520 align:middle line:84%
how to correct the distortion of
information in your body field.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Disease is, in a sense,
scrambled information.

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can access the
appropriate information,

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:25.530 align:middle line:90%
we correct the scrambling.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a number of
these new energy modalities

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.150 align:middle line:90%
are doing.

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:33.774 align:middle line:84%
They're basically correcting
that information scrambling.

01:05:33.774 --> 01:05:38.050 align:middle line:90%


01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I was diagnosed with
thyroid cancer when I was 20,

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
which resulted in
having to have surgery,

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and they removed all but a
fourth of my thyroid gland.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I've had to take a
synthetic hormone

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to give me the thyroid hormone
that I needed ever since.

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:57.430 align:middle line:10%
I was diagnosed with
chronic fatigue syndrome

01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:02.270 align:middle line:10%
some years later, and
fibromyalgia some years later.

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Which, I just continued
to get sicker and sicker.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.600 align:middle line:90%


01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
My husband had to pick me up out
of the bed if I had to get up.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
He had to feed me, set me
up in the bed and feed me.

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:21.630 align:middle line:10%
>> It got really bad, to the
point of where pretty much I

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:24.280 align:middle line:10%
bathed her and carried her
from the bed to the bathroom,

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.960 align:middle line:10%
and things of this nature just
for her to survive on a daily

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.330 align:middle line:10%
basis.

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:35.721 align:middle line:84%
>> They really didn't know what
to do for that type of illness.

01:06:35.721 --> 01:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty much told
that you just kind of had

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.610 align:middle line:90%
to live with it.

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I couldn't help
her, you know?

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what she told
me, what hurt or what felt bad

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
or what was happening,
I couldn't help her.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And neither could anybody
else, we didn't think.

01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> My doctor finally
said, Vanessa, you know,

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know what to
do for you at this point.

01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
All I can do is try
to give you medicines

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.580 align:middle line:90%
to make you more comfortable.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest that you
go see this nutritionist,

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and maybe she could help you
figure out what you can eat,

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
or at least you can start to get
some nutrients from something.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Vanessa actually was referred
to me by her endocrinologist.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.000 align:middle line:10%
When she first came to
me, she was literally not

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.740 align:middle line:10%
able to spend a day
at all out of the bed.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:33.550 align:middle line:84%
She had lost a tremendous
amount of weight.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.510 align:middle line:84%
She was allergic to
almost everything.

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I was having a lot of trouble
finding any foods that I could

01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
eat at all, which really
resulted in me being so weak.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The inside of her mouth had
a lot of sores inside of it.

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The lips had multiple
sores on them

01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:58.120 align:middle line:90%
like a cold sore-type thing.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And her hair was like
straw and coming out.

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I did
was the nest testing.

01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The system is designed to
determine areas of distortion

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.550 align:middle line:90%
in the body field.

01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
New information is made
available to the body

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
by ingesting drops that
have been imprinted

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.960 align:middle line:90%
with an information pattern.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I started her out at the
dosing that we would have

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
addressed a child because her
energy fields were that weak.

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So we started out
very, very cautiously.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> One morning, I woke up
after I had been seeing Deborah

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:36.350 align:middle line:90%
probably for a couple of months.

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:40.689 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this feeling
that I hadn't ever had.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And I knew--

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:48.000 align:middle line:90%
I knew that this was the answer.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.446 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so good
that I just cried.

01:08:52.446 --> 01:08:54.029 align:middle line:84%
I just sat up in the
middle of my bed,

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and I just cried,
and cried, and cried.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.649 align:middle line:84%
>> In about six months,
she reached an energy level

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
of where the body was beginning
to transfer a message more

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
effectively to where every
layer that we went through,

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
she was showing
remarkable health changes.

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Being from a man's standpoint
and a southern country boy-type

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
person is how I grew up, I first
thought it was hocus pocus,

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.760 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had my doubts,
and it took a while.

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:35.130 align:middle line:84%
But I see now that
it's phenomenal.

01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It truly is.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I've become healthy enough to
what I think is living a normal

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.029 align:middle line:90%
life again.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Because now, I can
clean my own house.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.270 align:middle line:90%
I can cook my meals.

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:48.090 align:middle line:90%
I can even work in the yard.

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I can even wash my car.

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I can do things that I
never thought I would ever

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.360 align:middle line:90%
be able to do again.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's 180 degrees
from where it was.

01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Just a total turnaround.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:00.850 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I really don't know how
to explain the difference

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.426 align:middle line:90%
in the way I feel.

01:10:05.426 --> 01:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like I died, and
I've come back to life.

01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought that I
would ever feel this way again.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I got my life back.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I got my life back,
and it's wonderful.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.240 align:middle line:90%


01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We're on the threshold of an
entire new understanding of how

01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
disease happens, how
information is transferred,

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and how to enhance information
transfer within living systems.

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:40.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a vast increase
in chronic disease

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
in our community, and I believe
using these information methods

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that we can treat the
chronic disease that

01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:50.287 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be treated before.

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Magnetic fields,
and more recently,

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
pulsed electromagnetic fields
are being used extensively

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
in medicine.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But where it gets
really interesting

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
is where you put information
in onto the signal

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
of a pulsed
electromagnetic field.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And that, we've been
witnessing within our research,

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
has been having incredible
effects on people's healing

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.330 align:middle line:90%
responses.

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most remarkable
instances of the effectiveness

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and the instantaneous effect
of informational medicine,

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I heard about recently.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with a
system called thought field

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
therapy, which is an energy
psychology that supposedly

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
heals and changes negative
thoughts around us.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is that negative
thoughts hang around us almost

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
like a net, and they
affect bodily systems.

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
They use this system in
Kosovo with survivors

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
of the war in former Yugoslavia.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.280 align:middle line:10%
These were families
who'd had been severely

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.760 align:middle line:10%
traumatized because the
policies of ethnic cleansing

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.910 align:middle line:10%
were to kill half of a family
just so the survivors would

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:57.960 align:middle line:10%
be demoralized.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So they took a
group of people who

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
had severe post-traumatic
stress syndrome, who

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
would have required years and
years and years of talking

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
cures and medicine, and all that
sort of conventional thinking,

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and they gave them
thought field therapy.

01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:15.330 align:middle line:90%
And to a person--

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
this is 100% of the
people in this study--

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
were made virtually
instantly better,

01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they
were laughing, joking.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.870 align:middle line:84%
They were healed completely
from this trauma.

01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Even the practitioners
of energy psychology

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.200 align:middle line:84%
were blown away by the
power of this modality.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But this just gives
us one small example

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:42.646 align:middle line:84%
of the power of using
information as medicine.

01:12:42.646 --> 01:12:46.770 align:middle line:90%


01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:50.040 align:middle line:10%
>> So the most important thing
for people to do is to take

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.920 align:middle line:10%
total responsibility
for their health.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.220 align:middle line:10%
Not to think that it comes
from outside themself

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.460 align:middle line:10%
or that somebody else
can give it to them.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And by taking total
responsibility,

01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that may mean they have
to start with choosing

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts that they
think so that they are

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
in a good state of mind,
the state of mind that's

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.990 align:middle line:90%
most conducive to healing.

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the fundamental
things that has to change

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
in the future of medicine is
this focus on the gene as being

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.810 align:middle line:90%
the solution to every illness.

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:27.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what
epigeneticists are coming up

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
with, you have an
understanding that the gene

01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is really subordinate to this
outside information system.

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And that we have to look
at information rather

01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:42.510 align:middle line:84%
than the gene as being the
thing that we have to crack,

01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:43.440 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to come up with
information systems that

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
regularize the
things that go wrong.

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:51.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I think there is absolutely
no question that health care

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.000 align:middle line:10%
today, at a global
level, is in crisis.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's a crisis of meaning.

01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:57.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a crisis of economics.

01:13:57.570 --> 01:13:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a crisis of leadership.

01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's a crisis of our
models and our understanding

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
of what promotes or
facilitates healing.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.290 align:middle line:10%
>> We do things like we
have a war on cancer.

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:14.620 align:middle line:10%
We try to destroy
invading organisms.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a warfare model
of health and disease

01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and how to treat disease.

01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And the body really
doesn't go for that.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to learn
from other cultures,

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.530 align:middle line:10%
from other traditions, from
the observations of all

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:34.230 align:middle line:10%
the different kinds of healers
that are working in our own

01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:36.540 align:middle line:10%
cultures at the moment.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to take the
best of modern science

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and use it to integrate
what's going on.

01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What we need to do is
foster a revolution that shifts

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
our model from a
disease-centered orientation

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
to a healing-centered
orientation.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin
to make that move,

01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:58.830 align:middle line:84%
you are responsive to a
variety of different factors

01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that can facilitate or enhance
our natural healing capacities.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:06.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I think we can rightly
say the revolution has begun,

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:08.310 align:middle line:10%
not just in my case.

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
There are research workers
all around the world

01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:13.200 align:middle line:84%
who are thinking much
the same, and who

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
have research data
that we can incorporate

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
into these new ideas
of the body field.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think now we have a
viable scientific theory

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:25.080 align:middle line:84%
for how the body stores
and accesses information.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.202 align:middle line:10%
So we do have a medical
revolution on our hands.

01:15:28.202 --> 01:15:33.535 align:middle line:90%

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>> There seems to be this huge
body of evidence demonstrating

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.010 align:middle line:90%
that we can pick up information.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:38.220 align:middle line:84%
That almost like an electron,
we can be everywhere at once.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:42.510 align:middle line:10%
>> So I would say, what healing
is is learning to correct

01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:47.080 align:middle line:10%
the human body field so that it
works according to the original

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:47.880 align:middle line:10%
blueprint.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.580 align:middle line:10%


01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.350 align:middle line:10%
>> As the universe is
holographic in nature,

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:56.460 align:middle line:10%
that means that we're all able
to access the information that

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:59.490 align:middle line:10%
we all need to be able
to operate healthfully.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:04.970 align:middle line:90%


01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:08.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So ultimately, what I'd like
to see is a shift from this

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.700 align:middle line:10%
disease-centered to this
healing-centered model,

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.150 align:middle line:10%
and recognizing that healing
is a profound mystery,

01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:16.160 align:middle line:10%
and that we have
so much to learn.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.740 align:middle line:10%
And rather than presuming
we have the answers,

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.630 align:middle line:10%
staying open to the
possibility that there

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.610 align:middle line:10%
are new things that we
can discover for how

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:24.190 align:middle line:10%
to enhance the human condition.

01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:31.170 align:middle line:90%


01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:34.595 align:middle line:10%
>> The mind is the functioning
of the brain that interprets

01:17:34.595 --> 01:17:37.800 align:middle line:10%
the environment and
adjusts the biology.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.320 align:middle line:10%
So rather than being
controlled by our genes,

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.277 align:middle line:10%
our biology's
controlled by our mind.

01:17:42.277 --> 01:17:43.860 align:middle line:10%
And when you understand
this, then you

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:47.470 align:middle line:10%
realize the power of being
able to change your mind.

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:49.174 align:middle line:10%
Because when you
do that, you change

01:17:49.174 --> 01:17:50.465 align:middle line:10%
your biology and your genetics.

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:53.090 align:middle line:10%

>> If someone's sick, they don't
want to know whether pill X

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.080 align:middle line:10%
works better than a placebo
in a double-blind trial.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.800 align:middle line:10%
What they want to
know is, what's

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.290 align:middle line:10%
the best kind of treatment?

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:14.320 align:middle line:90%


01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.600 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that we are more
powerful than we realize.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.560 align:middle line:10%
I believe that many of
the medical techniques

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.800 align:middle line:10%
that we're finding to
be very successful,

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:31.660 align:middle line:10%
people can do on themselves
once they understand

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:34.750 align:middle line:10%
their own energetics.

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:38.160 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very clear that negative
information is deleterious,

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.520 align:middle line:10%
or if you accept it into your
body and into your body system,

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.067 align:middle line:10%
it will change the way you
react and change your state

01:18:45.067 --> 01:18:45.867 align:middle line:10%
of health.

01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:57.650 align:middle line:90%


01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:00.880 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that from work by
William Tiller and others,

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.110 align:middle line:10%
we found that when you begin to
work with reconnective healing,

01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:06.880 align:middle line:10%
there's an amount of,
I believe he calls it,

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.800 align:middle line:10%
excess free thermodynamic
energy that is released.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.970 align:middle line:10%
That if this were
just energy or just

01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:16.750 align:middle line:10%
energy healing instead of the
reconnection, for this amount

01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:19.650 align:middle line:10%
to be released and this
change to happen in people,

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.990 align:middle line:10%
it would require that the
room temperature rises

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:26.380 align:middle line:10%
over 300 degrees centigrade.

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.350 align:middle line:10%
Which, of course,
does not happen,

01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:30.210 align:middle line:10%
because we're
accessing something new

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:31.410 align:middle line:10%
and something different.

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:52.010 align:middle line:90%


01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:56.160 align:middle line:10%
>> And coherence is the natural
resonant state of the human

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.550 align:middle line:10%
body, which we do
have, us humans.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:03.160 align:middle line:10%
We have a resonant
frequency, OK?

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.388 align:middle line:10%
And that's also what we
call the coherent state.

01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:32.980 align:middle line:90%


01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.920 align:middle line:10%
>> So a miracle starts
with a change of thinking.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:41.350 align:middle line:10%
It's like, when I changed
my thinking about my tumor,

01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:44.710 align:middle line:10%
and I decided it was my
best friend and my guide,

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:47.170 align:middle line:10%
rather than it being the worst
thing that had ever happened

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:50.300 align:middle line:10%
to me, that was the miracle.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.020 align:middle line:10%
When I gave it permission who
stay to the end of my days,

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.010 align:middle line:10%
that was the miracle.

01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:56.960 align:middle line:10%
People think it's
the end result,

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.480 align:middle line:10%
but it's not the
end result. It's

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.120 align:middle line:10%
the change of thinking,
which leads to a completely

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.450 align:middle line:10%
different inner state.

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:25.654 align:middle line:90%


01:21:25.654 --> 01:21:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You need both.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:31.240 align:middle line:10%
You need the will to be healed
and the good information

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.940 align:middle line:10%
from a therapist from
infoceuticals, whatever.

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:34.740 align:middle line:10%
Yes, of course.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.944 align:middle line:10%
This has to come together.

01:21:35.944 --> 01:21:36.832 align:middle line:10%
This has to match.

01:21:36.832 --> 01:22:01.990 align:middle line:90%


01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So healing is restoring
the body's own self-repairing

01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:09.760 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.230 align:middle line:10%
And that's the biggest thing
as a doctor you can achieve,

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:18.400 align:middle line:10%
that you can help your
patients with restoring

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.880 align:middle line:10%
their own repairing mechanisms.
