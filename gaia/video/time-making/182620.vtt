a high concentration of artists.

You know, it's about
having a place where,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
because of the open attitudes
and the casualness of it,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:90%

my daughter the other day,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, the one thing I think
I've learned from living here

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is how much integrity it takes
to do the simplest things.

rich community of makers,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:10%
of artists and
artisans, and partly

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:10%
because of the environment.

It inspires creativity.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And the natural
beauty of the island

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
creates a space for people to
be creative and to make things.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
There's also a very
supportive community.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:10%
Artists and makers
support each other,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.350 align:middle line:10%
help each other, trade
products with each other.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a very strong
support network that way.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the community at large
values the work that they do.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:10%
Whether they want
to learn from them,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:10%
they want to own and
appreciate and use the items

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:10%
that they make, it's supported
on all levels in the community.

to my desk job drawing

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and sketching jewelry and
reading jewelry books.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.492 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'd get
home and call my mom

00:03:56.492 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and ask her how to do things.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And it just evolved from there.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So it started as a hobby
about, say, 11 years ago.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
It had always been in my
life, but never an option

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%

and it worked out in ways that
I wouldn't have anticipated.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%

with the culture of people

making and crafting here.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%

to have been entirely unaware

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.765 align:middle line:84%

the ideal situation for myself.

infrastructure,
you know, casually

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
speaking-- for people to pursue
their craft independently,

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%

in a lot of other places.

She used to take
me to her studios

called her out of the blue,

of my childhood and listening
to my mom do her silversmithing.

the hiss of the flame,

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.565 align:middle line:84%
like the things about the slow

00:15:46.565 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that, I'm actually

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:90%

it, he heard

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:84%
another one of this

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:90%
seen one, because he's blind.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So for me, this is
very special for me,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:84%
because his interest in it is
a lot of what my interest is,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
is how it sounds and how
it feels and how it smells.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's tactile.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:90%
It's balance.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that is very--

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
even more kind of
poignant for me

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:84%
is that it's kind of a miracle

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.153 align:middle line:84%

So this instrument is
designed and made on Gabriola.

It's a Gabriola [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's got red cedar,
ancient red cedar belly

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and what we call yellow
cedar back and ribs, all

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
from very ancient wood, and
all salvaged from the beach.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%

true cedar, which they call

So one of the things that being
an artisan, it teaches you,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:90%
is respect.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%

for the people that

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:90%
came before you in your craft.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:84%
You had a question
about artisans.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:90%
What is the value of an artisan?

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of it, it's the
distillation of knowledge

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:90%
and technique and awareness.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I think it's a value
to society to have people that

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.115 align:middle line:90%
preserve traditional culture.

00:18:00.115 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a few
reasons why what I do

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
is really impractical,
because it's slow

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's really holistic.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But there are a few
reasons why it's actually

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of valuable, in that
because I'm not industrial,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I can use a lot of the material
that the industry overlooks.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:84%

is kind of my approach.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I start with materials
that I salvage,

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and then I bring that to a point
where it's a finished product.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%

materials come from,

how they were sourced,
what they are.

And then, you know, you do the
process all the way through.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%

slow, low footprint.

as people, as we

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
start to fear that maybe
our own subjectivity,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
our own way of being is becoming
more and more like these mass

try to resist that or correct

that's definitely

actually a kind of exodus.

the city, from the metropolis.

here had to do with a kind of--

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I guess a spirit of autonomy
and self-sufficiency

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:90%

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:84%
in the lower mainland or
Victoria operating now

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that was operating
when I started potting.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.298 align:middle line:84%
As retail rents rose in the
Vancouver Victoria area,

00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:84%
you just can't get enough
dollars per square foot

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:90%
on the shelves with pots.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.955 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is bulky,
heavy, and not very expensive.

00:30:06.955 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced people coming
here, wanting to buy things.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But you know, well, just ship
it to me in San Francisco.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And many times, the
cost of the shipping

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
was more than the value
of the stuff inside.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:10%
I just finally said,
look, if you want my work,

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:10%
you've got to walk up my road.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.047 align:middle line:10%
I sometimes think, oh, I wish
it was at a busy crossroads.

00:30:34.047 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, I don't really.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:90%
I like to live here like this.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.064 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.064 --> 00:30:42.663 align:middle line:84%
>> We should get
the weed whacker.

00:30:42.663 --> 00:30:44.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Every year, I do
things with the school.

00:30:44.455 --> 00:30:45.255 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:45.255 --> 00:30:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Couldn't we
get a wheelbarrow?

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.570 align:middle line:90%
We need a wheelbarrow.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Go get a wheelbarrow.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Hundreds of kids have been
through here over the last 35

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.888 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:30:57.888 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
It's been the
tradition at the school

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that the graduating class paints
about a 10-foot square section

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.035 align:middle line:84%
of a concrete wall around
the back of the school.

00:31:07.035 --> 00:31:08.785 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you guys
trying to do anyways.

00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Immediately, the idea
coalesced into, like,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:84%
an entry portal that had welcome
in English and [INAUDIBLE]----

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.860 align:middle line:90%
what's that?

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] beside it.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And then just a
clay button blanket.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing's made up
of these four-inch tiles

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that we were making
the other day.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.358 align:middle line:84%
And each kid's making
it individually,

00:31:40.358 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
yet the whole thing's being
pulled together by the fact

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.525 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just using
these two colors.

00:31:44.525 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
It makes sort of a
patchwork quilt out of it.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And across the board
are my dedication

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:84%
to the students of
tomorrow from the students

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:90%
of today sort of thing.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.470 align:middle line:10%
I love their
unfettered imagination.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like you look at
a little kids drawing.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't think about
whether, oh, I can't draw.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:90%
They just draw.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And at some point in
their development,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:84%
we become inhibited,
and then we can't draw.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who could
draw, now we can't.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I just like
to be part of getting in

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:90%
before that cliff.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.335 align:middle line:90%
And you know, yes, you can.

00:32:46.335 --> 00:32:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.420 align:middle line:90%
And here's how you can.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And just the enthusiasm
of kids and their knowing

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:90%
no boundaries, really.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I really, really enjoy
classes with kids.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love the fact that a
couple of hours of pandemonium,

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the end
coalesce into this table

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:90%
full of quite lovely things.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's really fun.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:31.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The islands collect people
who are all interesting

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:10%
in their own way.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.442 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of
the reason that we

00:33:37.442 --> 00:33:39.400 align:middle line:84%
love running the newspaper
on the Gulf Islands,

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.740 align:middle line:84%
is because there's
always a story to tell.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's always doing
something really interesting

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.378 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:33:47.378 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:10%
It's important to look
at the buy-in local,

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:53.100 align:middle line:10%
because you sometimes
take a little extra time

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:10%
in talking to the
person who made it,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.780 align:middle line:10%
and find out whether
this is something

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.242 align:middle line:10%
that's appropriate for what
you want to use it for.

00:34:00.242 --> 00:34:03.386 align:middle line:90%
And there's also that sense of--

00:34:03.386 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
the sense of pride

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
that it came from
your home community

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.590 align:middle line:84%
rather than from
wherever in the world

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.074 align:middle line:90%
it might have been made instead.

00:34:12.074 --> 00:34:13.699 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
biggest things people

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.491 align:middle line:84%
can do to make an impact
on their community

00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:19.330 align:middle line:84%
is ask that question,
can I get it locally?

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.235 align:middle line:84%
I think the creativity runs
through almost anybody that

00:34:22.235 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:84%
has to live on the Gulf Islands,
or chooses to live here,

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.880 align:middle line:84%
because by being an
island, it forces

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:84%
you to get creative in how
you do different things.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.693 align:middle line:84%
We talk about incubators in
the sense of the tech world.

00:34:33.693 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:84%
For Gabriola, what
we have here is

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
an incubator for the creative
side, where people can

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.128 align:middle line:90%
get creative about anything.

00:34:41.128 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:84%
With the Isle of the Arts
Festival, they come out

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and they share their techniques
and such in workshops

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.989 align:middle line:84%
over the course of nine or
10 days here on Gabriola.

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And locals attend those.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Visitors attend those.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.460 align:middle line:84%
The workshop hosts
themselves will often

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:84%
go to other workshops and
learn new ways of doing things.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing each
other how to better do things,

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:84%
how to better make things,
how to better create.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I try to incorporate
locally gathered materials,

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
just because it seems
the right thing to do.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.760 align:middle line:90%
It's more organic.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.636 align:middle line:90%
People identify with it more.

00:35:45.636 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
They can say, my gosh, that's
just like the blackberries

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I tripped on yesterday when
I was walking on that trail.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in a lot of
cases, it's nuisance stuff.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I use ivy.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.440 align:middle line:10%
Ivy is lovely to work
with, but a lot of people

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:10%
really curse it, especially
when it gets in their garden

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.580 align:middle line:10%
where they don't want it.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:10%
And the blackberries
are the same.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I started making
baskets in 2002.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.980 align:middle line:10%
There was a group
of us on the island

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:10%
that started by doing a
project to raise money

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.700 align:middle line:10%
for the food bank.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It was about 10 of
us that were hooked.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And we kept going.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:90%
We meet every week.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:90%
We have done since then.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Meet every week in
different people's homes

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:90%
and just make baskets together.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.690 align:middle line:90%
I have always loved baskets.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Right from when I was
younger, I collected them.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.375 align:middle line:90%
I bought them when I traveled.

00:36:55.375 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted to
know how to make them.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And when this opportunity came
up, it was perfect for me.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:10%
I use daffodil leaves a lot.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.200 align:middle line:10%
Make them into a cordage.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
This is what you end
up with, is the cordage

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that's got that lovely
golden tinge to it.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:39.063 align:middle line:84%
And then here, we have cedar
root and-- sorry, cedar bark.

00:37:39.063 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:84%
These are pine needles that
I've gathered right here

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:90%
on my street.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.580 align:middle line:84%
This is something I haven't
mentioned, deer horn.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I can drill into this
and use it for the handle

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:90%
of a basket like that.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.900 align:middle line:84%
This is cedar root, which
is beautiful to work with.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.775 align:middle line:84%
When it's wet,
it's very pliable.

00:38:00.775 --> 00:38:07.950 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:90%
You have an idea, and you do it.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And if it works, it works.

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't, you do
something else with it.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:14.482 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:38:14.482 --> 00:38:15.282 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.282 --> 00:38:18.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very much a
forgiving art form,

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:24.930 align:middle line:84%
because you can shape almost
anything when it's wet.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.660 align:middle line:10%
And it dictates
its own shape too.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of baskets have
a mind of their own.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And even though you're
wanting to make it this shape,

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:38.010 align:middle line:84%
it might end up quite
different, and sometimes more

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.600 align:middle line:84%
pleasant than what

in the days when we first

bought our place here.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:84%

called Gabriola dancing

dressed up as people got here.

Well, say on a Saturday
farmer's market,

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd sell 10 times the bread
that I would sell, say,

On the Saturday

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:03.890 align:middle line:84%
we'll make 11 different
kinds, I guess.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
about 11 varieties.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:90%

all the way along.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:84%

I think, between what I do

like a meringue

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:07.770 align:middle line:84%

that cooking was diverse

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.080 align:middle line:84%

me money, to the man that

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.578 align:middle line:90%
and I was on the fence.

00:50:07.578 --> 00:50:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to do that
more than the boat building.

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:14.620 align:middle line:90%
But then I got into doing--

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I started getting into more
of the wood side of it,

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.532 align:middle line:84%
and I really saw the
creative components to it.

00:50:20.532 --> 00:50:22.615 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like a
three-dimensional sculpture,

00:50:22.615 --> 00:50:26.900 align:middle line:90%
a functional piece of sculpture.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing
that side of it.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And that really changed
my point of view about it,

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't just
a job anymore.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing it
as a romantic world,

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.920 align:middle line:90%
and really appreciating it.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Wooden boats, if
you maintain them,

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.310 align:middle line:84%
they'll stay true and
strong for a long time.

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you let them
drop for a year or two,

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.340 align:middle line:84%
they fall very
quickly, and then they

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.830 align:middle line:90%
fall into disrepair very fast.

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And then to hire somebody to
fix it is quite expensive,

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.760 align:middle line:84%
so that's where I
come in, is I can

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.667 align:middle line:90%
teach those guys how to do it.

00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I've started running some
classes through my school now.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So they're woodworking classes
with a marine slant to them.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.055 align:middle line:84%
So some of them are basic
introduction to woodworking,

00:51:29.055 --> 00:51:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll teach other
things like block making, block

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and pulleys.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also doing other stuff
that's fun for me as well,

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's like driftwood
furniture making.

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:41.548 align:middle line:84%
So we can go to
the local beaches,

00:51:41.548 --> 00:51:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and we can collect
driftwood off the beach.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's just this--

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, we call it the
beach depot where we can just

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:52.788 align:middle line:84%
go pull this beautiful material
up and build simple furniture.

00:51:52.788 --> 00:52:04.020 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend on the island
here who mills up wood.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I go buy a lot
of my wood from him,

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and he's providing me
wood that's from Gabriola.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I turn around and
make things out of that.

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But where would I find that
anywhere else, you know?

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And be able to have the luxury
of going there and picking that

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.170 align:middle line:84%
out instead of having the next
guy behind me trying to outbid

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:28.240 align:middle line:84%
me or, you know,
trying to buy it all

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.430 align:middle line:84%
because he just wants to
hoard it away somewhere.

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So things are a
little slower, and I

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.110 align:middle line:90%
appreciate that very much.

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:46.020 align:middle line:90%


00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I think the creative
process eases.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:50.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
overlapping where

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.140 align:middle line:84%
you can take a lot of
those skills, knowledge.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:59.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for instance, for me
to be able to paint a boat,

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.690 align:middle line:84%
because I've worked
on boats for so long,

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I can actually see and make
sure that it looks correct.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if the lines
are off, the shape

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.030 align:middle line:84%
is slightly distorted
for whatever reason,

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
it can be quite irritating
to a lot of people,

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.458 align:middle line:84%
especially if they know how
boats are supposed to look.

00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When something
is made by hand,

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:84%
it connects the maker with
the material, for one,

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:39.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it's clay
or wood or silver.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.800 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual
physical connection

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:45.710 align:middle line:84%
between the maker
and the material.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:49.290 align:middle line:90%
It also implies a uniqueness.

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:53.645 align:middle line:84%
The item that's made,
it's not mass produced.

00:53:53.645 --> 00:53:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a one-off.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's made in a
mold or to a pattern,

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.810 align:middle line:84%
each handmade item is
going to be unique.

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have the
actual mark of the maker

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.880 align:middle line:84%
on it, because their
hands have touched it.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.910 align:middle line:90%

The value of artisan
work in a community,

00:54:15.263 --> 00:54:16.680 align:middle line:84%
particularly in a
small community,

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.150 align:middle line:84%
it connects people
to each other.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.400 align:middle line:10%
When I go see a
potter or a jeweler

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.340 align:middle line:10%
and I take a bowl or a
cup from that potter,

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.770 align:middle line:10%
then I have a
connection with them.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.570 align:middle line:10%
Not only a financial
transaction, but I

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:29.370 align:middle line:10%
have something.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a bowl or
a cup that I use

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:35.460 align:middle line:84%
every day that I have my
coffee out of in the morning.

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.790 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm always
mindful of that creator.

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.100 align:middle line:10%
And then in this
community, I also

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.550 align:middle line:10%
know that my neighbors
and friends and people

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:51.240 align:middle line:10%
around the island are also using
a [? Gramshian ?] bowl or cup,

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.590 align:middle line:10%
or wearing jewelry made by Nina
Turczyn or by Laura Hanford.

00:54:55.590 --> 00:55:00.030 align:middle line:10%
So we're all
connected by the way

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:05.340 align:middle line:10%
we have and use and display
these handmade items

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.760 align:middle line:10%
on the island.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we're connected
to the artist.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:90%
We're connected to each other.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:14.778 align:middle line:84%
We're connected to this
place through the material.

>> When you're doing
stuff like this,

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:21.150 align:middle line:84%
you're working with your hands,
you're using material that has

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:22.126 align:middle line:90%
been in--

00:55:22.126 --> 00:55:25.350 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:29.970 align:middle line:84%
has evolved with humankind
throughout the history

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:31.890 align:middle line:90%
of our existence on this planet.

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So to have a
disconnect from this

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:39.345 align:middle line:84%
and not appreciate it
or not learn it I think

00:55:39.345 --> 00:55:41.148 align:middle line:90%
is really unfortunate.

00:55:41.148 --> 00:55:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.892 align:middle line:84%
I think kids need to
be playing with wood,

00:55:55.892 --> 00:55:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and they need to be playing
with other materials that

00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.850 align:middle line:90%
brings them back to who we are.

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> They see that we value this
work, and we value the artists.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.260 align:middle line:90%
We value the process.

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's creating the
next generation of artists

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and makers, or the
next generation

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:27.240 align:middle line:84%
of people who will appreciate
and value art and artists.
