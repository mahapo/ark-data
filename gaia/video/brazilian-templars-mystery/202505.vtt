The cross is
striking to Kathleen

for a number of reasons, but
foremost among them is the fact

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that the carving is
here in the first place.

Kathleen hastily takes several
pictures of the carving.

After she and Adele
return to their posada,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Kathleen decides that she

This is where hundreds
of Templar Knights

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:10%
had been imprisoned by King
Phillip IV of France in 1307.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And there, on the dungeon walls,
were the remains of graffiti

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:90%
carved by the jailed knights.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Doomed by the king to torture
and eventual execution,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
they left behind numerous
glyphs of Templar crosses

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:90%
indicative of their era.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
During her visit, Kathleen
photographed these glyphs.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> During my trip in
2009 to Domme, France,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
my husband and I-- we had
gone there originally to see

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%

the representative

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:10%

there, gave me the key,

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:10%

as much time as we liked.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:10%

everything.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I photographed all the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and just spent about
an hour in the space.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we were done, I took the
key back to the representative

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.022 align:middle line:84%
there and asked him who actually
carved the glyphs there.

00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said that they
were done by the Templars

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
while they were
awaiting their death.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, well,
what do these symbols mean?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
of small figures--

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
men, male figures, it
appeared to be, with crosses

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
above their heads, and just
several crosses throughout,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
all over on the walls.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, the Templars
were a religious order,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and he believed them
to be religious glyphs.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea that
six years later, in 2015,

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.475 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to be traveling

mind about the relationship

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
between the glyphs in France
and the carving in Brazil.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:10%
What she already knows is this--

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:10%
several hundred Templars,
including their grand master,

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:10%
Jacques de Molay, were
imprisoned and murdered,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:10%
many in Domme itself.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
This, combined with
the earlier fall

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
of their stronghold of Acre
in the Holy Land and abolition

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
of their order by
papal bull in 1312,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:84%
led the surviving Templars
to take drastic measures.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:84%
These seismic events
forced the Templars

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
to seek a place where
they could carry out

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:90%
their mission in safety.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
So they reorganized
themselves in Portugal.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But might some
Templars have found

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
it necessary to leave
Europe entirely?

There was nowhere
else to go but water.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:10%
And one of the main reasons
that I think they left so early

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:10%
was that they were
maybe even somewhat

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:10%

they'd created in Portugal,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:10%

the money, they had the men,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:10%
and they certainly
had the motivation--

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:10%
left to Brazil and colonized
the area in Alto Paraíso,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:10%

in the immediate aftermath

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:10%

make a fascinating story,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:10%
which is brought to
light in numerous books

could set up a secular state.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And their benefactor, who
was Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
the centerpiece of the
Templars, was the head

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
of the Cistercian order.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
where he came from,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
he was also looking to create
a kingdom of conscience

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
in a part of Europe, something
that had not been corrupted

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:90%
by the Catholic belief system.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
He wanted an original
form of Christianity

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to be founded on the
principles that were set up

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
in the days when Jesus
and his disciples

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
were around and yet
almost different to what

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
they were practicing, almost
like a Buddhist ideal.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars found themselves
in this unique opportunity

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:84%
where they had a brand new
piece of real estate with which

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
to operate from
scratch and set out

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%

freedom, away from the church.

The primary headquarters
of the Templars

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.384 align:middle line:84%
was thought to be in France,
where grand master Jacques de

Molay and several
thousand other Templars

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:90%
resided prior to their capture.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But Silva convincingly argues
that the Templars actually had

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:90%
several strongholds in Europe.

Philip IV of France

replenish his depleted coffers.

He had already rounded
up and murdered the Jews,

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
confiscating all
of their property.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But he was also in
great financial debt

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to the Templars, a debt that
he wished to avoid paying.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
On Friday the 13th, 1307, he
moved against the Templars,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:84%
arresting them and confiscating
all of their wealth and lands

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:90%
in France.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
The fact that many Templars
who escaped Philip's wrath

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:84%
fled to Portugal, which had
also welcomed the Jews, Cathars,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and Gnostics, suggests that the
Templars held vast lands there,

as well.

stronghold for them.

dominated, basically,

[VOCALIZING]

Silva says in his book that
"Portugal" can actually

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
be interpreted as
"port of the grail."

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So how would he
define the meaning

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
of the grail in this context?

>> I was looking
at the king's seal.

the first clue

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:10%
that nothing is really
out of the ordinary

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:10%
is that your eye glances
over the king's seal,

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:10%
and it says Portugal.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:10%
And you think,
OK, it's Portugal.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:10%
But if you're an
initiate of the mysteries

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:10%
and you know how to hide
things in plain sight,

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:10%
you basically look
at this a bit slower.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%

over this Templar cross.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
reads "portu-gral."

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a suggestion that
somehow, the grail is involved

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:90%
in Portuguese territory.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:10%
It's very subtle.

But to anyone who
knows the mysteries,

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:10%
they know these subtleties,
and they pick up

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:10%
on these little clues.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But to a person
who's deeply involved

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:84%
in metaphor and
symbolism, you begin

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to read the letters
as an anagram.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you're Portuguese,
it reads as a phrase.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And it says "por tu
o gral," and that

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
translates as "through
you, the grail," which

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:84%
means there's something
about that territory,

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that town in which Tomar
sits, the Templar stronghold,

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that is associated with
some kind of grail quest,

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
some kind of understanding
of what the grail is about

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:90%
and what it does to you.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.930 align:middle line:10%
Because the same phrase is
also found, of all places,

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.800 align:middle line:10%
on the northeastern pillar
of Chartres Cathedral, where

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:10%
there's a depiction
of the actual grail

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:10%
and the Ark of the Covenant.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And it says right under there,
"through you, the grail."

between what the
Cistercians and the Templars

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
were doing in Chartres
Cathedral and what

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.830 align:middle line:84%
they were doing in Tomar in
Portugal, there is an overlap.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is to do
with the mysteries.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And to understand
the mysteries is

very Marian in their worships.

So that's the man that
started the Christianism.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:84%
For them, he's the one that
is the mentor of Christians.

But it's from the Mary, the
mother, that life comes.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And being that, as a ritual
for the Templar Knights,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and they use that in a
lot of their symbolism,

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
it gives us that clue that they
might be protecting something

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.850 align:middle line:84%
offers a reasonable explanation
for how the Templars might

say that the axis

of gravity of the
European synarchy

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:84%
was kind of relocated
to the Peninsula.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it began
all this research

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to rescue the knowledge
of this information,

Because the Arabs had
closed the doors on us

by the end of the Crusades.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they began to rescue
those ancient legends--

what islands there were,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And then came all those
things about Atlantis, things

about the Phoenicians.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And then navigation started.

when they had to admit that
they already knew Brazil.

Unfortunately, the story
we learned in school

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:10%
is that they deviated
from their path to India.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that they
came here intentionally.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, ah, it
was the island of Veracruz.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:84%
They would say it was an
island not to call attention

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
from other powers of the time
like England, Holland, France,

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and Spain.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And to not call this
kind of attention,

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:84%
they divided Brazil in the
hereditary captaincies.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And after this, they named
it Veracruz, Land of the True

up and lifts the hammer

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:90%
on the other end.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:84%
After the container fills
up, it goes back down

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and spills the water out.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:84%
That change of weight allows the
hammer to go back down again,

into the vast wilderness.

They go without a guide but with
a great sense of determination

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.025 align:middle line:90%
to rediscover the cave.

00:41:40.025 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.670 align:middle line:84%
However, this turns out to
be a rather difficult task.

The previous year's fire
has burned all the trails

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:54.270 align:middle line:84%

hours of searching.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.280 align:middle line:84%
They're tired, hungry,
and with no better

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.860 align:middle line:84%
idea of where the cave is
than when they started out.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.500 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, several more days
pass before they are again

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.280 align:middle line:90%
granted access to the land.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But this time, they find
an old, rusted sign hidden

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:90%
by brush that reads gruta--

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.010 align:middle line:90%
"cave" in English.

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So they at least have
a starting point.

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:34.940 align:middle line:84%
The sign, and Kathleen's
memory of her 2015 visit,

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.320 align:middle line:84%
give them a general sense
of where the cave should be.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Once again, Kathleen
and Trajano set out

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.010 align:middle line:84%
with high hopes of
finding the cave.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Their first three attempts
lead to nothing but dead ends.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It is only on their last
chance to find the cave

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.730 align:middle line:84%
that Kathleen's intuition
finally bears fruit.

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Trajano, weighed down with
his heavy film equipment,

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.190 align:middle line:90%
is ready to give up.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But Kathleen insists
on persevering.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.640 align:middle line:84%
She makes her way through
dangerously tall grass,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:84%
which hides not only deep
ruts and boulders but also

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.880 align:middle line:90%
poisonous snakes and spiders.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And she finds the
vein of crystal

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:90%
that she last saw in 2015.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about three
feet, four feet, deep--

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:40.780 align:middle line:84%
wide, wide-- and probably about
four to five feet in height.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's solid crystal
all the way down.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a vein of it
that goes all the way

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:49.870 align:middle line:90%
down this whole area.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, all this whole area.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.102 align:middle line:90%
I will show you a piece.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:90%
This is what it looks like.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.716 align:middle line:90%
We have a piece of it.

00:44:02.716 --> 00:44:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It's white crystal.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And this whole thing, this
whole wall, is all of crystal.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.492 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.492 --> 00:44:17.944 align:middle line:90%
It's magnificent.

00:44:17.944 --> 00:44:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And we cross over it
before we get to the cave.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Now she knows that the
cave is only another mile

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.660 align:middle line:90%
or so farther away.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.100 align:middle line:90%
But in which direction?

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So the first time I came, we
crossed this crystal wall,

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and then we went
down to the cave.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if
it's this direction

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:84%
or if we came in
from this direction.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.850 align:middle line:90%
We'll have to check both ways.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to see
both ways and see.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit more exploring
to do before we find the prize.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.600 align:middle line:84%
We can walk the wall
and look this way

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:90%
and look this way, too.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Walk the wall this way and
then walk the wall this way

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and see which way
where we find the cave.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:21.210 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Following the vein
of quartz crystal,

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.130 align:middle line:84%
first in one direction
and then the other,

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.200 align:middle line:84%
she notices a knoll off
to the right below them.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The knoll has an odd, dark
area just in front of it.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Instinctively, Kathleen
feels that this is it.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.820 align:middle line:84%
She thinks that they may
have found the cave entrance.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.070 align:middle line:90%
But Trajano has doubts.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps what Kathleen sees
as the mouth of the cave

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:84%
is only a shadow created
by the overhanging brush.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.150 align:middle line:84%
He worries about hiking downhill
with his heavy equipment

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.450 align:middle line:84%
for what may be only
an optical illusion.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So while Trajano waits,
Kathleen heads down

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:90%
to explore on her own.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:07.990 align:middle line:84%
The closer she comes,
the surer she is.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Within 100 yards or so of the
cave, she calls out to Trajano

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and tells him to
bring the equipment.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.220 align:middle line:84%
He will soon see this
magnificent discovery

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:90%
with his own eyes.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:84%
More importantly, he will
document it with his camera.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Moments later, Kathleen is
just 20 feet from the cave.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.370 align:middle line:84%
She can see the
edges of the opening

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:35.690 align:middle line:84%
almost completely overgrown
with bushes and small trees.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:39.110 align:middle line:84%
The brush is her only
remaining obstacle now,

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and she immediately
begins to clear it away.

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:44.526 align:middle line:90%
Until there it is again.

00:46:44.526 --> 00:46:45.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo!

Yeah, there's the cross.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:05.100 align:middle line:90%

>> The Templar cave, carved
out with nothing more than hand

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:14.700 align:middle line:84%

between 1292 and 1315.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And above it is the
distinctive Templar cross that

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.820 align:middle line:90%
marks it as Templar property.

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.644 align:middle line:90%

This is the Templar cave.

The Templar cross
right here, the same

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:48.870 align:middle line:84%
cross I saw in Domme,
France, in 1307.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:54.080 align:middle line:84%
There was 1307, dated, where
they kept the Templar knights

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.340 align:middle line:90%
in Domme, France in the dungeon.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And they left graffiti the
same as this, the same tool

markings.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.630 align:middle line:90%
This was done by hand tools.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:07.570 align:middle line:84%
This was not done
by modern tools--

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.750 align:middle line:90%
hand tools.

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.495 align:middle line:90%

>> Wow.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say immediately
that it is a cross related

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:90%
with the Templars.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.700 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt it
has relations with it.

to search the area for more
artifacts and to interview more

the Templar roots in this area.

researching and keep

visiting the lands
of the Templars

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to bring this mysterious
order out of the shadows
