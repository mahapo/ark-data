00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.134 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty weird, right?

00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I should probably
cancel your phone plan.

some pretty important stuff

You know, I remember
when I was young,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and you came home every
night, watched the news

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:90%
without saying a word to me.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And you'd wind your pocket
watch before going to bed.

It was like you didn't
know you had a kid.

Every night I had something
ready to tell you,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:90%
just in case.

But you never did, not once.

You never asked me anything.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:90%
You never talked to me.

Well, I'll tell you
what though, Dad.

I'm not so great at it either.

00:16:53.788 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:90%
The talking and sharing.
