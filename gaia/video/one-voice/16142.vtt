00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:90%
for all of this, came forward.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And all the activity,
the noise, the names,

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
the forms, everything
took on sort

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
of almost like a wavy reality
and shifted backwards.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
It was there, but it
didn't really matter.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
What mattered, what
was most present,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
was this peace, this
unshakable peace.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I looked--
everywhere-- there was

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
just peace, peace, and peace.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The entire
universe is pervaded by me,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
in that eternal form
of mine which is not

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
manifest to the senses,
speaks Krishna, a deity

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:90%
from the Hindu tradition.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Even though I am not
within any creature,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
all creatures exist within
me, although they do

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:90%
not exist within me physically.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:90%
That is my divine mystery.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:84%
How can one describe
the indescribable?

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
In the mystical view of reality,
the distinction between self

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:90%
and other disappears.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Where physical and perceptual
boundaries previously existed,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.000 align:middle line:84%
there remains only
wholeness and unity.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Siddhartha Gautama, an Indian
prince known as the Buddha,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
taught that ultimate freedom
is not outside ourselves.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It is not only within us,
but it is our very nature.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Although there are many
pathways to this living truth,

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate reality is
nothing other than life itself.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It is an experience available
to each of us, this very moment.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:84%
The practices used to move
towards this mystical summit,

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and the words used to
describe it, may vary.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But all mystics agree
that this living truth is

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.215 align:middle line:90%
ever present within our hearts.

00:12:49.215 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of
unity with all that is.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
That there's a sense of
union with everything.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And it is the most
extraordinary and exalted

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:90%
of human experiences.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Even though the
mystic paths are

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:10%
living within the traditional
religion, they go beyond it.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They have much more of an
understanding of their unity,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
because they are
addressing the human heart.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:10%
When I speak of mysticism,
I mean the experience.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:10%
It's obviously an experience,
it's not just something

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:10%
to talk about or read about.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It's an experience.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And it is an
experience of unity,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and communion, and a communion
with ultimately reality.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:10%
It's a loose term, like
many spiritual terms.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:10%
But what it means is that
dimension of our being,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:10%
which is transcendent,
which is utterly unlimited,

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:10%
which is outside of time,
outside the realm of form,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:10%
outside of any kind of duality.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The way I would use
the would be one which

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
leads to at least
an intuition, if not

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
a full awakening to that
transcendent quality

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:90%
of our own being.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:10%
For me it means a
nonconceptual experience,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:10%
which is direct, and intuitive,
and not mediated by reason

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:10%
or reflection, and which
often is contrary to things

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:10%
that we previously believed
or took for granted.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:10%
Whether we know
it or not, we're

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:10%
always that creative source.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:10%
We can't be anything else.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:10%
Not only we can't be anything
else, there's nothing else.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:10%
There seems to be
a direct experience

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:10%
with something that is
luminous, and expansive,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:10%
and has no boundaries.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be some
aspect of the human mind, when

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
we are able to drop our thoughts
and just simply be with what

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
is, there seems to be some kind
of commonality that crosses

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:90%
over all traditional lines.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you get to
the mystical level,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
you go beyond the differences
that the different scriptures,

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
or dogmas, or
traditions present.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:90%
You go to the underlying unity.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:10%
At that time, we don't have
a discursive mind around.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:10%
And we don't even
have an ego around.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
It is not something
that you attain.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It is something
that you merge with.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It is something that you become.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:10%
We are talking about an
experience in which the I-ness

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:10%
of man has totally disappeared.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, he doesn't
talk about himself

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:10%
or anything else but God.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't see
anything else but God.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:55.655 align:middle line:84%
So we would say in Christian
mysticism, that God in us

00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:90%
is recognizing God in others.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
All of the trappings, the
clothing we wear, where we come

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
from, how we speak, what
language we use, it all

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:90%
falls away for mystics.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be universal-- I
would say a universal fragrance

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:90%
to mysticism.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways
I'm sometimes asked,

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean
to be a mystic,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.750 align:middle line:90%
or what is a mystical teaching?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:90%
The image I often use is a rose.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
That I can talk till I'm blue in
the face for the next 100 years

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:90%
on what a rose smells like.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going
to be understood.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But if I hand somebody a
rose and say smell this,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and they smell it, we
now have a commonality

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:90%
that we can speak about.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
mystical experience is like.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, the intellectual
will think of what

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:90%
could be a utopian society.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the mystic knows
that paradise is within,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and that we can offer paradise.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
We can offer the
nectar of paradise.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
We can offer the banquet
table of love to humanity.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
And we can all sit at that
banquet table together.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Were you to bring
10 lamps in one place,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:84%
each one would be different
from the other in form.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at their
light, you cannot differentiate

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:90%
one from the other.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Seek the meaning of
the Quran and say,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
we make no distinction
among our messengers.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Were you to count a hundred
apples, a hundred fruits,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:84%
the hundred would not
remain, but become

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:90%
one when pressed together.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:10%
In matters spiritual, there
are no parts, no numbers.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:00.175 align:middle line:84%
In matters spiritual, there is
no division, no individuals.

00:18:00.175 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Mohammad and the founders
of all the great religions

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
of the world have communicated
the same universal message--

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the diversity
of spiritual traditions

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:84%
while seeing their
inherent unity.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:10%
This essential teaching
becomes distorted

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:10%
by the various beliefs and
ideologies that arise when

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:10%
the original prophets
are no longer alive,

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:10%
and formal institutions
replace their inspired thoughts

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:10%
and visions.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Mystics recognize
this difficulty,

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and describe how the present
day teachings can sometimes

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:84%
become imprecise reflections
of the prophets' true messages.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:10%
Today, I would say that the
two biggest issues that we face

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:10%
are religious warfare
and intolerance,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:10%
and might say the fundamentalist
attitude which most religions

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:10%
have, or at least some
people within them

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:10%
have that attitude of, I'm
right, everybody else is wrong.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:90%
This is the only way.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And I will kill
you or immobilize

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:90%
you if you don't believe this.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a great deal
of this kind of activities,

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
including suicide
bombing, they are

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
the result of a hopeless,
desperate situation.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
A great deal of that, of
course, is just product

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
of ignorance and prejudice.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Particularly in
the case of Islam,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
suicide is considered
a capital sin.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it is believed that
only God gives you life,

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:90%
and only God can take it away.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Suicide bombing has no religious
justification whatsoever,

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
as far as the
Quran is concerned,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
there's no even slight
allusion to actions like that.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I think if you ask Jesus,
if you ask Buddha, if you ask

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
the great saints and sages,
they're not going to tell you,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:90%
go kill people.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want you to do.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:90%
They came in the name of love.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:90%
What did Jesus say?

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:90%
What is the highest teaching?

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So how can you say that's the
highest teaching and then say,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
well, God's will is
to go kill someone?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
While there is no conflict
among spiritual people

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:84%
in the world, there
is a great deal

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:40.545 align:middle line:84%
of conflict between religious
people in the world.

00:20:40.545 --> 00:20:46.205 align:middle line:84%
And religions, of course,
meant to foster, and cultivate,

00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and protect spirituality.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:84%
But religions are
also, in contrast

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:84%
to spirituality in general,
religions are institutions.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And culturally,
and historically,

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.693 align:middle line:90%
embedded and conditioned.

00:21:03.693 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And institutions are
always self-serving.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:84%
That is just the shadow
side of the institution.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So even within the
same Christianity,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.513 align:middle line:84%
we have many, many
different denominations

00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
that have good
reasons you might say

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
for having a chip on the
shoulder against one another.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
They have killed one another
for a very long time.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is difficult
to overcome.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:90%
The reason is not spiritual.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, it's exactly
the opposite to spiritual.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Like Jonathan Swift
in Gulliver's Travels,

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
it was his sort of
wonderful representation

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
of which end of the
egg do you open.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Are you a sharp or are
you a pointy end opener

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of the hard boiled egg,
or are you a blunt end

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.012 align:middle line:90%
of the hard boiled egg opener.

00:21:59.012 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And the two will war with each
other till the end of time

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
because they attach to the
right end to open the egg,

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and then argue with
each other forever.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's using it as an analogy
for spiritual arguments,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
particularly within
the Christian church.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
All the fight in
the planet, though it

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
is being projected as
good versus as evil,

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:90%
please look at it carefully.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
It is not about good and evil.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It's one man's belief
versus another man's belief.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
That's all it is,
religious or otherwise.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But your belief versus
somebody else's belief

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
is all the fight
is about always,

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it's within the family,
or between two communities,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.975 align:middle line:90%
or between two whatever.

00:22:41.975 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:10%
When you look at the teachings
themselves, they're great,

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:10%
But when you hear it
filtered through people,

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:10%
or see how people act,
they're quite different.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:84%
If you know enough about
human beings, you would know,

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.075 align:middle line:84%
human minds are given
to enormous distortion.

00:23:01.075 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:10.050 align:middle line:84%
If I teach 100 people
something, these 100 people

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
will have 100 interpretations
of what's been said.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:84%
More often than
not, it seems to be

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
the interpretation
of the followers

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:84%
rather than the original
prophets or enlightened

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:28.550 align:middle line:84%
beings that create
that kind of-- well,

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that impression of, well it's
the pollution of the world

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:84%
or the corruption of the world,
the guys in the next valley,

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:84%
or the other tribe,
or the heretics.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So just destroy the evil,
destroy the heretics,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and then it will
be a pure world.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it doesn't seem
to be the awakened ones

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
or the great prophets and
teachers that said that,

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.870 align:middle line:84%
but more the secretaries,
the historians,

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and the commentators, and the
interpreters over the ages.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.152 align:middle line:84%
They come up with
that take on things.

00:23:59.152 --> 00:24:00.485 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes the
received knowledge.

00:24:00.485 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
Muhammad said, or

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, or Guru
Nanak said, or it

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:90%
says in the Bhagavad Gita.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It begins with a great
prophet, or a great avatar,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
a great charismatic leader who's
filled with that divine spirit.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The truth just radiates,
pulsates from that being.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
They are surrounded by
a group of disciples

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:90%
who are not at that level.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So each one interprets,
in their own way.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we could say
that every religion

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
begins with a religious
or spiritual experience.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:45.445 align:middle line:84%
And it's that experience that
is the job of the leadership

00:24:45.445 --> 00:24:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of any particular
religion to transmit

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.062 align:middle line:90%
to the next generation.

00:24:50.062 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Now you need some
structures to do that.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But the structures
must not stand

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
in the way of the experience
of the founder, which can't

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
be communicated by
words, or documents,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:90%
or structures themselves.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:16.224 align:middle line:84%
There's a little teaching
by the writer Wei Wu Wei,

00:25:16.224 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
who wrote some wonderful books.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And he has these
little aphorisms.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "what
are most people doing?

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.034 align:middle line:84%
Worshipping the teapot
instead of drinking the tea."

00:25:30.034 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.620 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Hillel a
Jewish mystic who

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
lived 70 years before
the birth of Christ

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
was approached by a
religious skeptic who

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
challenged him to
teach the entire Torah

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:90%
while standing on one foot.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Hillel replied, "what is hateful
to you, do not do unto others.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:90%
The rest is merely commentary."

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The condition of the
world mirrors the state

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:01.945 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:26:01.945 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
When we directly realize the
interconnectedness of all life,

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
hatred and all forms of
aggression will cease.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Peace in the world will become
a reality when individuals

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
realize that we
belong to each other,

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that there is but
one human family.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Peace does not
come from political

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.130 align:middle line:90%
or external solutions.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It is inner peace that
leads to outer peace.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The need of the hour, what
everyone is clamoring for,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:90%
is peace.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
to politicians.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They're looking to people who
don't have that peace within

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:84%
to somehow negotiate it
for us, or to somehow

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
guarantee it through treaties,
or win it on war fields.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
That peace is in
fact our true nature.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we're going
to find peace in the world

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
is if people find
the peace within,

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:90%
and then share it with others.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:84%
One thing is without individual
human beings being peaceful,

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:90%
world peace is a faraway thing.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Peace is not because the
Dow Jones is doing well.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Or peace is not because
there's no war on earth.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:10%
In the core of
everything, there is peace.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:10%
That means everybody, every
thought, every emotion,

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:10%
every circumstance.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We know that our experience
that in the beautiful thoughts,

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful people, and
beautiful circumstances.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we're willing
to experience it also

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:84%
in the worst of circumstances,
in those people that we

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:84%
consider not good, and those
emotions that we consider

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:84%
negative, if we are willing to
meet all of that, all the way

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:90%
in, we find peace.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So that there can be peace,
even when you're angry.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
There could be peace,
because it isn't

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon a
particular physical state.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
There can be peace
even when things

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.270 align:middle line:90%
are going terribly for you.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a great
lesson to me after 9/11

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:84%
when, as established as
we were in our practice,

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:90%
everyone was quite distressed.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
seeing an interview.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
It was Diane Sawyer with a
sister-in-law of bin Laden.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And she asked-- Diane Sawyer
asked the sister-in-law,

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:90%
do you hate him?

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you hate him for
what he has done?

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And she responded,
I don't hate him.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:90%
He hates.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.290 align:middle line:90%
And look what that has led to.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:84%
One has to know
what peace is first

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to wish
that for the world,

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:90%
much less to attain that.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
philosophical process.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It is a process of
seeing, a process

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:84%
of looking, a process of
being present with what

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:90%
is actually here.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Then the peace
emanates from within.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm inclined to think
that peace in the world

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:84%
was most likely to come from an
increasing perception of people

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:57.081 align:middle line:84%
in general, of the oneness of
the human family at the deepest

00:29:57.081 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And that divisions are really
something that are made by us,

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:90%
not by the reality itself.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:10%
And life that is articulated
within the context that looks

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:10%
graphically like a
whole bunch of people

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:10%
holding hands together, and
walking towards a chasm,

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:10%
but singing.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they know, that if they
fall, all of them together,

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:84%
beauty is the only
thing that can happen.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Creation is, by nature,
both harmony and conflict.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And conflict is part
of the greater harmony.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:84%
The role of
teachers, of leaders,

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:84%
guides, parents,
should be to guide

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.850 align:middle line:90%
the conflict into harmony.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not that conflict
will not appear.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It will always appear.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But the role of one who's
been invested with authority

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:84%
should be toward balance,
and toward peace and harmony.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we have for the
first time on this planet,

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
we have the necessary resources,
and technology, and everything

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
possible, food and everything,
so that the whole of humanity

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:90%
can live well.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Never before this
possibility was there.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.570 align:middle line:90%
For the first time, we have it.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to make
it happen, or are we

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.940 align:middle line:84%
going to use this as a power
to exploit everybody else?

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Just depends on who
is leading the world.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:84%
We need to acknowledge the
tremendous impact of people

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:84%
in the leadership
roles, and choose people

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
for leadership roles
who have the capacity,

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and the understand,
and the wisdom,

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and the compassion to lead
in a way that will bring

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.840 align:middle line:90%
about more peace in the world.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.880 align:middle line:84%
If a few key leaders, if
just 25 people on this planet,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:84%
the top leaders in the world--
25 people-- if we transform

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
them, even 10% in
their minds and hearts,

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I think the wars can just stop.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Just 25 people.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.822 align:middle line:84%
I know that we want
enlightened leaders.

00:32:19.822 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we can
wait for enlighten leaders.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
That we as ordinary people
can take responsibility

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:84%
for finding where we
are at war, and being

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:84%
willing to stop that
war, and recognize

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:90%
the capacity for peace.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:10%
War is simply an expression
of human friction.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.900 align:middle line:10%
That expression can vary.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't have
to be all out warfare.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
We can have many constructive
expressions of human conflicts

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:59.460 align:middle line:84%
War is more of a statement
of absence than the statement

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
of presence-- absence of
care, absence of love,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:84%
absence of community, absence of
a sense of family and village.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And war is a human misguided
initiative to state rather

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:25.050 align:middle line:90%
aggressively what is needed.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:29.730 align:middle line:84%
What human want more
than anything else?

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:90%
To be in love.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:39.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the great
keys I would say

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:84%
to creating peace in the
world is again, gratitude.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:84%
If we are grateful to one
another for the contributions

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
that each one
makes to the world,

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:84%
we will have a
completely different

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:90%
attitude to the others.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:05.030 align:middle line:84%
If we are grateful to
other people for instance,

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:10.300 align:middle line:84%
other nations, other cultures,
we will have a completely

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.270 align:middle line:90%
different attitude.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
We will not be tempted
to make war on them.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.375 align:middle line:84%
We will not even have time to
make war on them because we

00:34:19.375 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:84%
will been so busy
cultivating that bond

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:90%
that we have with one another.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:90%
There's no Chinese anger.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And there's no American greed.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:90%
And there's no Indian love.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.310 align:middle line:84%
These are universal
qualities of mind.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:84%
And they work in the
same way in all people.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of awareness,
the nature of consciousness,

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that which knows
different experience,

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.120 align:middle line:90%
is the same in all people.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:84%
What I see is that
aggression, and hatred,

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and fear are not of the
nature of that primordial god.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not the nature of
our essential nature.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.690 align:middle line:84%
It is not part of
the perfection.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:84%
However, it's ignorance
of the perfection,

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:84%
not being aware of
the ground, not being

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.210 align:middle line:90%
open to our spiritual nature.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:84%
That fact, that disconnection,
that disassociation, by itself

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:84%
moves our experience
to the opposite of it.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Instead of love,
there will be hatred.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Instead of peace, there will
be aggression and discord.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.380 align:middle line:90%
No war is still not peace.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:90%
People are going to turmoil.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.280 align:middle line:90%
That's still not peace.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:84%
If you want consistently
to be peaceful and joyful,

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.460 align:middle line:84%
you have to make some
effort to understand,

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to know how to
operate this machine.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the most complex
machine on the planet,

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.240 align:middle line:90%
your body and your mind.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.850 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, we
don't take it easy

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.640 align:middle line:10%
and relax waiting
until we attain

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:10%
enlightenment to be peaceful.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
We trying to live
peacefully because then

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:13.450 align:middle line:84%
we cultivate anything regularly,
again, and again, and again.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.450 align:middle line:84%
That is what is
going to be perfect.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Once in awhile you get
a marvelous experience

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.440 align:middle line:90%
of unity of the human race.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.478 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when
they went to the moon,

00:36:27.478 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and they had this exciting
countdown as this spacecraft

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.542 align:middle line:84%
descended to the
surface of the moon.

00:36:33.542 --> 00:36:34.775 align:middle line:84%
NEIL ARMSTRONG
(DURING MOON LANDING):

00:36:34.775 --> 00:36:36.085 align:middle line:90%
Tranquility base here.

00:36:36.085 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:90%
The eagle has landed.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
When he put his
foot on the moon,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.550 align:middle line:84%
everybody put their
foot on the moon.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:46.818 align:middle line:84%
I think it was an intuition
that somehow man had moved out

00:36:46.818 --> 00:36:49.440 align:middle line:84%
of his cradle on
the earth and was

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:90%
entering into the space world.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was doing so with
a very holistic attitude.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And they saw this gorgeous
blue and white ball

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a black velvet
background, utterly helpless.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:09.170 align:middle line:84%
They realized that it's
insane to fight over

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:84%
the real estate of this
fragile little ball

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.910 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of nowhere.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:84%
They have to work
together to make it work.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:22.850 align:middle line:84%
The moist effective way is to
deal with one person at a time.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.810 align:middle line:84%
One person's
consciousness, first of all,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:30.300 align:middle line:84%
affects the other
people in the room.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.875 align:middle line:84%
So that may just be
one other person.

00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And that person will
influence another person.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And that person will
influence another person.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:10%
One person can sense
two person is good.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:10%
Then two person can
sense another two person,

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.790 align:middle line:10%
become four.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.960 align:middle line:10%
And four person can
sense that person.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You keep influencing
10 people, in your life,

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and these 10 will
produce 100 people.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:84%
These 100 will
produce 1,000 people.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Like that, it will spread
very gradually, naturally.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But the deep real thing
grows very slowly.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.910 align:middle line:90%
It takes root.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, roots must go
deep down into the ground

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:84%
in order to make it very strong,
and powerful, and effective.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end,
world become peace.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.440 align:middle line:10%
So from the point of view
of one person who perceives

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:31.980 align:middle line:10%
deeply, sees deeply into
the unconditioned nature

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:10%
of the human heart,
that experience

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.475 align:middle line:10%
liberates all beings,
whether they know it or not.

00:38:46.475 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Mystics
view all life as being

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.030 align:middle line:84%
interconnected and
interdependent.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Love is the glue that
holds it all together.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:10.560 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus said, "love
thy neighbor as thyself,"

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:84%
he meant each of us is
part of an integral whole.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Our neighbor is truly
a part of who we are.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
With this realization, the
division between self and other

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:90%
disappears.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:84%
All that remains
is an open heart.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Compassion is love made visible.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It is the heartfelt desire
to relieve the suffering

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.290 align:middle line:90%
of all living beings.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It arises naturally
when we realize

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:46.570 align:middle line:84%
our inherit unity rather than
focusing on what separates us.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:10%
Rumi defines love as that
essence which makes thorns

00:39:53.910 --> 00:40:02.550 align:middle line:10%
into flowers, which transforms
bitter vinegar into sweet wine.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Love is that essence
that transforms

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:90%
a devil into an angel.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And what better definition
than this for love?

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I say
about love, which is so simple,

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:21.080 align:middle line:84%
is that the only way it
works is by giving it.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:90%
And it can never be banked.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I love to try to
speak about love.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:33.322 align:middle line:10%
But love is like the word god,
or enlightenment, or self.

00:40:33.322 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It is corrupted by
our concepts of it.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And in general,
we have concluded

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.175 align:middle line:84%
that love means
when we feel good,

00:40:43.175 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:84%
or we're turned on
in a certain way.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's my experience that
love includes all of it.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.590 align:middle line:10%
Love is indefinable,
indescribable.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:10%
And yet, each of us has
experienced it to some degree.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:10%
Love is an infinite ocean.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:10%
Love is like the word infinite.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:10%
You can draw a little
figure eight on it,

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.420 align:middle line:10%
lay it on its side, and
say, it's an infinite thing.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Love is infinite.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, Einstein let's
us know, the human mind

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.900 align:middle line:90%
can't grasp infinite.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And the human mind
can't grasp love.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.170 align:middle line:10%
Life is the source of love.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:10%
And love in turn is
a source of life.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.930 align:middle line:10%
Without love, life
will be meaningless.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And without life, we don't
have the appropriate means

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.880 align:middle line:84%
with which to allow love
its full expression.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.770 align:middle line:10%
When I talk about
love, I think of it

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:10%
as being synonymous with
consciousness, or acceptance,

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.160 align:middle line:10%
or god, or source.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:84%
It is simply another word for
the totality, for everything.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of the Dao,

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
love and compassion
are the very essence,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.140 align:middle line:90%
the very nature of mankind.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is why,
when we have love,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:90%
we feel such happiness and joy.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we don't have
love, we feel such longing.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.583 align:middle line:90%
And we seek everywhere for love.

00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But in the willingness
for the mind to surrender

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.069 align:middle line:90%
to this very deep love, Ananda.

00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:31.492 align:middle line:84%
There's a possibility to love
even who you can't trust.

00:42:31.492 --> 00:42:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Even love your enemy,
as Christ would say.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.890 align:middle line:84%
From Islamic point of
view, the whole universe

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
is the scene of interplay,
of divine attributes.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.177 align:middle line:84%
And one of the divine
attributes is love.

00:42:45.177 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:10%
I think the one
thing that I haven't

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:10%
said yet that's really important
to say is, God is love.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
The most powerful, uniting
common thread of all

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.370 align:middle line:90%
would be love.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a common thread,
not only to unite

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.330 align:middle line:84%
all the different religious
paths, different faiths,

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:84%
but also a common thread
to unite all mankind.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It is literally, I think,
the ultimate golden thread,

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:84%
the bond that unites all
of us in a way that is

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.305 align:middle line:90%
indestructible and everlasting.

00:43:18.305 --> 00:43:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.800 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Each
spiritual tradition

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:84%
calls the ultimate reality
by a different name.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:90%
To some, it is god.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:37.900 align:middle line:84%
To others, the Dao, Buddha
nature, the ground of being,

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and countless other names.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.508 align:middle line:84%
Yet all of them point to the
one truth that unites us all.

00:43:44.508 --> 00:43:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.500 align:middle line:84%
All the different
spiritual paths ultimately

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.020 align:middle line:84%
converge in the
discovery that we

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.596 align:middle line:84%
are one with the great
perfection of life.

00:43:56.596 --> 00:43:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:84%
When Krishna Murti, a
20th century mystic,

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:84%
states that, "truth
is a pathless land,"

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:84%
he is describing the realization
that when we experience

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:84%
the light of truth and enter
the transcendent realm,

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:18.150 align:middle line:84%
we have moved beyond
all spiritual paths.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.390 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, many
spiritual traditions

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.910 align:middle line:84%
throughout our long history
have shown us the way

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.630 align:middle line:90%
to this timeless reality.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The mystic honors each
spiritual tradition,

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and realizes its
importance in creating

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:84%
a medium for every person to
discover the ultimate truth

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.370 align:middle line:90%
for him or herself.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:46.342 align:middle line:90%


00:44:46.342 --> 00:44:49.390 align:middle line:84%
The reason I think there's
so many spiritual paths

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:middle line:84%
is that there are
so many cultures.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:10%
And that's the beauty
of the whole thing.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.950 align:middle line:10%
You see, I think that's
the key to appreciating

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:04.250 align:middle line:10%
the fact that we should approach
other spiritual traditions

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.710 align:middle line:10%
with the spirit of
openness, receptivity,

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.560 align:middle line:10%
and shouldn't argue them,
shouldn't try to justify

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.120 align:middle line:10%
our own and find them wrong.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Because all of those
traditions have

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:84%
arose because of
circumstances, because of time,

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.690 align:middle line:90%
place, position, and degree.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
What Judaism was doing at
that period of time in history

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.200 align:middle line:84%
was addressing the problems
that needed to be addressed.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's survived
to this day was it works.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Catholicism, it works.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Protestantism, it works.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism, it works.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.120 align:middle line:10%
And originally,
human cultures evolved

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.750 align:middle line:10%
as part of a natural ecosystem,
part of a natural bioregion.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:59.190 align:middle line:10%
And the cultures that
evolved, in part,

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.980 align:middle line:10%
evolved out of that
natural harmony

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:10%
relationship between nature and
human culture, human groups.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So it evolved to a
tremendous diversity,

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.690 align:middle line:84%
very much like the biodiversity
you find all over Mother Earth.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:19.390 align:middle line:84%
We have almost all the sacred
traditions in this country now.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:23.684 align:middle line:84%
And that's a phenomenon that has
come about in the last 20, 25,

00:46:23.684 --> 00:46:25.280 align:middle line:90%
30, 40 years.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinary how the
teachers have come to this land

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.960 align:middle line:84%
to educate people, to
plant the seeds here.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Because divine destiny has
some plan here, clearly.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it would
not be happening.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.150 align:middle line:10%
So now for the first
time in history,

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:51.940 align:middle line:10%
the teachers, major teachers of
the world religions and paths

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.030 align:middle line:10%
are able to speak to
each other at a level

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:58.380 align:middle line:10%
never before possible.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.515 align:middle line:84%
I also think that no one
tradition sort of understands

00:47:01.515 --> 00:47:06.620 align:middle line:84%
the whole story, and that
each tradition understands,

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to some extent or another,
something wonderful

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.470 align:middle line:84%
about the divine, and
about spiritual life,

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual reality.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.630 align:middle line:90%
But not the whole picture.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And so as we come to understand
all the different religions,

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.118 align:middle line:84%
we get a fuller and fuller
picture of the divine reality

00:47:19.118 --> 00:47:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual life.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:10%
The many birds in the air,
they all have their own songs.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:32.280 align:middle line:10%
I have yet to see a
crow sing an eagle song.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:90%
They don't intertwine.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:90%
They don't share.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't share their
songs because that's

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.950 align:middle line:84%
a song that was given to
them from time immemorial.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And this way, if you
are Buddhism, of course

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.230 align:middle line:10%
you have path.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.990 align:middle line:10%
You have enlightened path.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:52.420 align:middle line:10%
If you think it's good for
you, if you understand that,

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:56.610 align:middle line:10%
it's good for your
negative emotions,

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.880 align:middle line:10%
good for develop
you inner world,

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.860 align:middle line:10%
loving kindness, compassion,
clarity, peace, happiness.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And you choose that.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's good for you.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the very
pure path for you.

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And also, you don't have to
worry about another religion.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But you are not allowed to
say, other religion is wrong.

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:23.380 align:middle line:10%
I know my teacher, Swami
Satchidananda used to say,

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.140 align:middle line:10%
it would be ridiculous if
you thought about food,

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.380 align:middle line:10%
and you went to a gathering,
and a group of people

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:34.260 align:middle line:10%
got up and said, pasta is the
only food that we should eat.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing
to satisfy hunger.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Or another person got up and
said, no, pudding is the way.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Pudding is the only way.

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the salad people got
up and said, no, salad, vegan,

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.560 align:middle line:90%
that's the only way to go.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:90%
We would know it was ridiculous.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet we do that exact thing
in the name of religion.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.660 align:middle line:10%
That transport
that we look for is

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:06.030 align:middle line:10%
what we might call spiritual
path, religious affiliation.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, people
given any destination

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.290 align:middle line:84%
can, depending on
what is available,

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.120 align:middle line:84%
choose to go there by
bike, choose to walk there,

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:23.690 align:middle line:84%
choose to ride there, or fly
there, For Dagara people,

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:28.920 align:middle line:84%
my people, what we choose as
means of transport to get down

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to that essence is
indeed what nature,

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.570 align:middle line:90%
the natural world is offering.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:36.700 align:middle line:10%
I think one of
the reasons there

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.370 align:middle line:10%
are so many different
religions in the world--

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:middle line:10%
I think the reason was
expressed by the Buddha

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.340 align:middle line:10%
when he said that
he sees nothing

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:52.460 align:middle line:10%
more varied than the
quality of people's minds.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.140 align:middle line:10%
Some of my students have
been cooking during Ramadan

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.700 align:middle line:10%
so the people who
fast during the day

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.910 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't have to cook
while they're hungry.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.290 align:middle line:84%
These are kind of the
things that only happen

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.390 align:middle line:84%
when we appreciate each
other's calendar and say,

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:10.240 align:middle line:84%
not that the others are bad like
we said in the medieval period,

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.400 align:middle line:84%
but to say everybody
in this whole world

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.950 align:middle line:90%
has something to contribute.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:19.040 align:middle line:84%
At one of these
conferences-- it

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.150 align:middle line:84%
was held at Gethsemani
Abbey in Kentucky,

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.580 align:middle line:84%
which is where Thomas Merton
had lived, and been a hermit,

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:26.520 align:middle line:90%
and wrote.

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was this big, wide
hallway in the monastery.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama was
walking down the hall.

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And he came to a statue
of the Virgin Mary.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And he just stopped
for a moment,

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and bowed, and paid
respects, and then walked on.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't know.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.470 align:middle line:84%
His Holiness didn't know
anybody was watching.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It was just a
completely spontaneous,

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.400 align:middle line:84%
heartfelt gesture
of respect for what

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.040 align:middle line:90%
the Virgin Mary symbolizes.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful moment
when we can have respect.

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:07.800 align:middle line:84%
A sentence in the Psalms says,
"I'm a friend to all those

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.510 align:middle line:90%
who respect you God."

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Not that we should all
try to put ourselves

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:16.600 align:middle line:84%
in a mishmash of religions,
some kind of cocktail

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.190 align:middle line:84%
religion-- a little
bit of Judaism,

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:20.050 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of Buddhism,
a little bit of this,

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:20.990 align:middle line:90%
a little but of that.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:25.210 align:middle line:84%
No, each religion has
an integrity of its own.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who are
called to spiritual life,

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.450 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
there's a responsibility

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to really go deep
in our practice,

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:41.460 align:middle line:84%
exemplify it, and
carry that torch high

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.280 align:middle line:90%
so that others can be inspired.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Not that we preach,
not that we try

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:51.860 align:middle line:84%
to impose our way, but
the torch of unity,

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.050 align:middle line:84%
of peace, of
brotherhood, I think

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.270 align:middle line:84%
it's the most important thing
we can do today, especially

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:04.810 align:middle line:84%
today when we have the capacity
to utterly destroy one another.

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So how can the
religions come together

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:10.520 align:middle line:90%
themselves and make peace?

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:16.774 align:middle line:84%
Because they are often
the source of conflict.

00:52:16.774 --> 00:52:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And for one, I would say
if they would listen more

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to their own mystical
tradition, if they would hearken

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to the teachers who are alive
at the time who were teaching

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:33.170 align:middle line:84%
within their tradition, but from
the point of view of, you know,

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:38.070 align:middle line:84%
the inner sacred, the
human, the temple,

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that would enlighten
the religious traditions.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because Islam,
in the book of Quran, which

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:50.430 align:middle line:84%
calls itself a universal
book of wisdom and love,

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:53.380 align:middle line:90%
has a wonderful model for that.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:57.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it says that all
the traditions are true.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And it says even
that you can only

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.110 align:middle line:84%
be a true Muslim,
a true believer

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:06.340 align:middle line:90%
if you believe them all.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it true that you have
to go, at the highest level,

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:11.920 align:middle line:90%
there's only one.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.780 align:middle line:84%
My response is
the word universe.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.740 align:middle line:84%
One direction is
so towards the one.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the uni.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The other one is the
verse, towards diversity.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.330 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
ultimate truth.

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's god.

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's called by different
names in different traditions.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately he's the
one and only ultimate truth

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.330 align:middle line:90%
that he exists.

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You may call it Allah in Islamic
tradition, God in English,

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.610 align:middle line:84%
or any other name
in other traditions,

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.860 align:middle line:84%
but you are in fact talking
about one single reality.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.510 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: "Wisdom
says I am nothing.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Love says that I am everything.

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.450 align:middle line:90%


00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Between the two, my life moves."

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:07.230 align:middle line:84%
These words of Nisargadatta
Maharaj, a Hindu mystic,

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.830 align:middle line:84%
reflect the understanding
necessary for a deep spiritual

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:11.970 align:middle line:90%
transformation to occur.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:16.140 align:middle line:90%


00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.952 align:middle line:84%
"The beginning of wisdom is
to know that we do not know.

00:54:19.952 --> 00:54:22.880 align:middle line:90%


00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are limited
to those things that

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.815 align:middle line:90%
can be compared or contrasted."

00:54:30.815 --> 00:54:33.170 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:40.830 align:middle line:84%
"The one ultimate truth lies
beyond the grasp of the mind."

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.200 align:middle line:90%


00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.800 align:middle line:84%
"The beginning of love is to
know that we are the other.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.540 align:middle line:84%
True love knows no
boundaries, and illuminates

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.560 align:middle line:90%
everyone's heart.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.100 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.100 --> 00:55:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of peace is
to find it within ourselves.

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It is our own inner
peace that leads

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:07.591 align:middle line:90%
to peace within the world."

00:55:07.591 --> 00:55:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.670 align:middle line:84%
"The beginning and
end of this journey

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:16.170 align:middle line:84%
exists right here
and right now, for we

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:23.856 align:middle line:84%
are coming home to a place
that we have never left."

00:55:23.856 --> 00:55:29.710 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:32.320 align:middle line:84%
If you genuinely
want to seek, the most

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.890 align:middle line:84%
fundamental thing
is that you should

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.240 align:middle line:90%
know that you do not know.

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.230 align:middle line:84%
The minute you say, I've got
it, guaranteed you've missed

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:41.280 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.320 align:middle line:84%
If we don't know
what realization is,

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:49.020 align:middle line:84%
we're much closer to
realizing what it is.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.840 align:middle line:10%
The word seeker simply
states that you have

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.150 align:middle line:10%
realized that you do not know.

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:59.250 align:middle line:10%
Because without realizing that
I do not know, you cannot seek.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.470 align:middle line:84%
People have destroyed
I do not know,

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:05.350 align:middle line:84%
because they have not realized
the immensity of I do not know.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Only if you see, I do not know,
the possibility of knowing ever

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:11.160 align:middle line:90%
arises in your life.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.820 align:middle line:84%
If you destroy I do
not know, you destroy

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.310 align:middle line:90%
all possibilities of knowing.

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.640 align:middle line:84%
There are many words
in different traditions

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.290 align:middle line:84%
pointing to the deeper
reality of the true self.

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:24.910 align:middle line:10%
The Buddha was
very clear about,

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:27.070 align:middle line:10%
the words can only
point to the truth.

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.730 align:middle line:10%
They cannot embody it.

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Whether you say a Buddha or a
god, or whatever words you use,

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.720 align:middle line:84%
you're only talking
around it, never it.

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And in Dao cultivation,
we feel that it

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.940 align:middle line:84%
is not necessary to distinguish
between these terms.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.390 align:middle line:84%
All these terms
are equally valid.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter which terms

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.380 align:middle line:84%
we decide to use
as long as we're

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.470 align:middle line:90%
talking about the same thing.

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:59.160 align:middle line:84%
If we look at history,
once we name god or the Dao,

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.330 align:middle line:84%
then it's really
not god or the Dao.

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It's some thing that's actually
defined by our language

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:07.910 align:middle line:90%
and our concepts of it.

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:10.070 align:middle line:84%
John of the Cross is
talking about the same thing

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:11.500 align:middle line:90%
that Hakuin's talking about.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Teresa of Avila is talking the
same thing that [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.320 align:middle line:90%
was talking about.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Walt Whitman is talking
about the same thing

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:25.630 align:middle line:90%
that Basha was talking about.

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally different
world of experience

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing to
do with the words

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.870 align:middle line:90%
and ideas that describe it.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:10%
From my experiences
with talking

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:48.440 align:middle line:10%
with other representatives of
other spiritual traditions,

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:54.000 align:middle line:10%
it seems to me that we are all
talking about the same thing.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.600 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to say
it's the same experience,

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.130 align:middle line:84%
because even two
experiences myself

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:04.260 align:middle line:84%
are two different experiences
and not the same experience.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But to the extent to which we
can say we have all experienced

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:16.640 align:middle line:84%
the same thing if we see
a sunrise or a waterfall,

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:22.630 align:middle line:84%
we can say we all
experience the same reality

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:25.250 align:middle line:90%
as ultimate reality.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, all these terms
need to be transcendent.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these
terms are simply pointers.

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.050 align:middle line:84%
There's no question,
when you get

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:41.640 align:middle line:84%
beyond the words and ideas
that describe things,

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.900 align:middle line:90%
you're in the same zone.

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
let go of the idea

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that somehow, the inner mind
is affected by what's happening

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:57.620 align:middle line:84%
in the outside world, and
instead, embrace the idea

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:00.920 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately, it
is the inner landscape

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that becomes reflected
as manifestations

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:05.730 align:middle line:90%
in the external world.

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anything out
there can give us meaning.

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think the mistake,
the main mistake people make

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.200 align:middle line:84%
in life is they
seek happiness, they

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.870 align:middle line:90%
seek meaning in external ways.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually only
when people have exhausted

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and convinced
themselves that that's

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:35.790 align:middle line:84%
not going to do it that the only
place else to look is within.

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:39.700 align:middle line:84%
It is just that, the
problem is not because they

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:40.650 align:middle line:90%
did something wrong.

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It is just that, we have
done nothing about it.

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.380 align:middle line:84%
You have invested so
much amount of time

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:53.190 align:middle line:84%
to earn a living, to
make outside comfortable.

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:56.200 align:middle line:90%
We fix the outside so much.

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.770 align:middle line:84%
What have we done
to fix the inside?

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has been invested,
either in terms of time,

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:04.400 align:middle line:84%
or resources, or energies,
what does humanity

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.850 align:middle line:90%
invested for inner well being?

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.650 align:middle line:84%
No investment, no dividend.
That's all.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.360 align:middle line:90%


01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has being done about
how to be within yourself.

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The main thing
is to do something

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to prepare ourselves and not
just sit there waiting for it

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.510 align:middle line:90%
to drop down from heaven.

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I think one aspect is having
a regular daily practice,

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
whatever particular
spiritual form one is

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:37.230 align:middle line:90%
engaged, but in a formal way.

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's sitting
meditation, or prayer,

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it might
be, but that it's

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:44.380 align:middle line:90%
actually done regularly.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a daily
renewal in of the connection

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.490 align:middle line:90%
to our highest values.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And without that,
it's very easy to be

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
caught up in the
conditioning of the world.

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
In our tradition, what
we call short time,

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
anytime practice,
that meditation.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can apply it while
you're eating, driving,

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
walking, watching movie,
having party, taking walk,

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.190 align:middle line:84%
anytime and everywhere
it can apply.

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Go hike in nature.

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Stand in front of
a very tall tree,

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the
deep noisy silence

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:40.570 align:middle line:90%
held together in that entity.

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And wonder, why can't
it be like that?

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Stand still, in the same place,
for, we don't know how long.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And find oneself growing
taller, and taller, and taller,

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:00.860 align:middle line:90%
both upward and downward.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
There is something about
that which defined greatness

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
as the most obvious depths
of quiet, inside of which,

01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:16.880 align:middle line:90%
the deepest song can be heard.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.651 align:middle line:84%
There's something so
powerful about the vows

01:02:19.651 --> 01:02:20.350 align:middle line:90%
of the Bodhisattva.

01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:24.140 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:30.328 align:middle line:84%
And because we chant them
every night, they become--

01:02:30.328 --> 01:02:36.340 align:middle line:90%


01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:38.750 align:middle line:90%
They're the sound inside you.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
They're the wind, and
the sound of the rain.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're the crow.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're the sound of
the door being opened.

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And they are the door opening.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
We need to encourage
people to think

01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that contemplation, while it's
a gift, is already been given.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.806 align:middle line:84%
Hence, it's a question of
awakening to this capacity,

01:03:03.806 --> 01:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and exercising it, and
reducing the obstacles

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in ourselves, which
is called purification

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:15.430 align:middle line:90%
in classic Christian terms.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
If we want to understand
ourselves, we have to sit down,

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
or stand up, or be in
some posture, and observe,

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%
what is our mind doing?

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
What are the qualities
in our heart?

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's only out of
that understanding

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that a sense of meaning
begins to emerge,

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and we actually are
fulfilled in it.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, in many ways,
it's a lot more difficult,

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
because there are so
many more distractions

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.950 align:middle line:90%
than, say, 10 centuries ago.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, I believe
reward is equally greater.

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
It was not very difficult
to be a pious person

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
10 centuries ago.

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It is quite a challenge to
be a pious person today.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I think a mistake that
people sometimes make,

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and the reason they
fail in keeping

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that spiritual perspective
throughout their daily life,

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
is they leave their practice
in the meditation room,

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
or on the yoga mat.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And they forget to bring
it into their daily life.

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
of pure arithmetic.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone
practices two hours a day.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the day, 22
hours, they do nothing.

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:38.040 align:middle line:84%
They just let the mind
run amok, let's say.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just arithmetic.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Which force, which tendency
will predominate in your life?

01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say, amok is
in the lead 11 to 1.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can practice.

01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
You are religion, nonreligion,
and Buddhism, no Buddhism,

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.510 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is not taking
instructions from you

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
because you never made
an effort to understand

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:02.840 align:middle line:90%
how to operate this instrument.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Any instrument that
is out of control

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
is more of a
nuisance than of use.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual
teachings for everyone

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is for like a small
collection of people

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.550 align:middle line:84%
who like to live an extremely
quiet and simple life.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.230 align:middle line:84%
That everybody is
excluded unless they become

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
a monk or a nun, this
is probably something

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.890 align:middle line:90%
invented by monks and nuns.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
For the teachings to be useful
and to be very effective,

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
them it's important
to recognize that they

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
are essentially practical
tools to work with our life.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.840 align:middle line:90%
And they're accessible.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They're things that we can
apply throughout our days.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
A thought can arise.

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts arise
just on their own.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And in the normal
course, we follow them.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
We then build on that through
into the 10,000 thoughts.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.741 align:middle line:84%
But if we can recognize
a thought is arising,

01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:05.650 align:middle line:90%
it's not right, it's not wrong.

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
choice, in that moment,

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
it's just a split
second, just to open

01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and let that thought disappear,
back to where it came from.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Takes a lot of honesty,
it takes a lot of courage

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to look into
one's own mind, one's own heart

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and take a very honest look
at what is actually there,

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
if our minds are filled with
anger, and filled with hatred,

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and filled with jealousy,
and filled with envy,

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and filled with fear.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Then that's what we're
contributing to the world.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:48.360 align:middle line:10%
We have to train ourselves in
a very systematic way, looking

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:56.770 align:middle line:10%
at our own mind and heart to
see how quickly we get agitated,

01:06:56.770 --> 01:07:00.860 align:middle line:10%
how quickly we get anxious,
how quickly we get envy.

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.800 align:middle line:90%


01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
When we see this, then
we'll be able to restrain,

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
have patience, then
learn to be peaceful.

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:21.370 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen automatically.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
It is not something
that we were born with.

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:30.340 align:middle line:90%
There is no path except you.

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
other path except you,

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:38.096 align:middle line:84%
because if you want
to know anything,

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
perceive anything,

01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
experience anything,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
the seat of your experience
and perception is within you.

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So there is only
one path that's you.

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Just by beginning
to exists ourselves,

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
whenever you decide
that took place,

01:07:56.650 --> 01:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
you are essentially in
relationship to God.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And hence, just by being born,
one is on a spiritual journey,

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.810 align:middle line:90%
whether you like it or not.

01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
no other choice.

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:15.490 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: For centuries,
seekers have traversed the globe

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:21.644 align:middle line:84%
in search of individuals who
could provide the answers

01:08:21.644 --> 01:08:22.901 align:middle line:90%
to life's mysteries.

01:08:22.901 --> 01:08:26.750 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
We have heard mystics
from the world's

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.819 align:middle line:84%
great spiritual traditions
directly address

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:36.331 align:middle line:84%
these questions, sharing their
wisdom and their loving hearts.

01:08:36.331 --> 01:08:39.260 align:middle line:90%


01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
They encourage us to look
beyond our apparent differences,

01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
to realize the one truth
that unites us all,

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly,
to manifest

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.175 align:middle line:90%
that truth in our daily lives.

01:08:52.175 --> 01:08:57.319 align:middle line:90%


01:08:57.319 --> 01:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
My message for humanity is that
every single person can find

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%

That is the most
important thing.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:32.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not to think about it,

There is only one power.

When we think of
ourselves as limited,

then we think it's our power.

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%

and look at each other,

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
the gift of love.

It has no market
value right now.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:56.340 align:middle line:90%
But what if it does?

01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
What will the world look like
once we convert our frustration

01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
into compassion, convert our
hatred into solver of love,

fired at one another randomly?

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
What if we invade and obtain
the spirit of the invading each

01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:28.515 align:middle line:90%

What would the world look
like, changing our discourse,

the very word that we use

each other, are subdued

01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:56.540 align:middle line:90%
and turned into words of love?

That when you hate someone,
send that someone a love poem,

01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%
