00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BKS Iyengar.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Courage.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:90%
What a man.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
What a teacher.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking about Iyengar is
like speaking about a mountain.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:10%
We say that he lived to
be this many years old.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
He was born in the
great influenza outbreak

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:10%
that his mother was
afflicted with while she

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:10%
was pregnant with him.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But what does that
speak to of a man?

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:10%
>> First, he was my father.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:10%
Later, as I began to understand
things, he became a teacher.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:10%
And obviously, he is a guru.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:10%
>> And although my teacher
in Glasgow talked very--

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:10%
with great reference
about Mr. Iyengar,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.175 align:middle line:10%
that was the first time
I heard the term Guruji.

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And it was obvious in the
way these people talked

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:10%
and their demeanor the
huge influence he had,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:10%
the great respect
that they had for him,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:10%
the love that they had for him.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:10%
>> I was in a bookstore when
I was just a 21-year-old man

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:10%
and was intrigued by the photos
that I saw with that book that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:10%
we have come to see as the
treatise of what yoga really

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:10%
could be.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And opening the book
and watching the pictures,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:10%
I was totally amazed that the
master was totally keeping

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:10%
the control of the body.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I was interested as to who is
this person and how can he have

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:10%
the same expression on his face,
irrespective of whether the leg

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:10%
is around his neck or whether
he's standing straight.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:10%
>> And when I saw the
book Light on Yoga,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:10%
I was so enthusiastic to
meet this man and to meet him

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:10%
in person and get
teaching from him.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I had heard so
much about him,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and I had heard of him
in such high esteem.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I remember holding my breath
when I heard his footsteps

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and he opened the
door and walked in,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
chest first, a mighty man
in simple white kurta.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:10%
>> So the first time I
think that I saw him,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:10%
what struck me was
how royal he looked--

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:10%
his immaculately pressed
silk dhoti or his silver hair

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:10%
and bushy eyebrows.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:10%
>> He walked into the room, and
suddenly there was this light.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:10%
And I just knew,
this is the man was

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:10%
going to teach me everything.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And when he came
out into the platform,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:90%
his energy filled the room.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:90%
He was not a tall man.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:10%
He was a short man,
but his energy which

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:10%
very tall and very expansive.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And something inside
of me at that moment

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
knew that my life
was forever changed.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:10%
>> It was a moment where from
the first moment I knew that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:10%
this was something very
special that I had encountered

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:10%
>> I didn't actually realize
that he is something special.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:10%
My father is something special.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:10%
I could see that he's
different than others.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:10%
He performs something
in a different way.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It was awe and
wonder, and it was--

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:10%
there was something very
engaging about it that made me

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:10%
want to do better, to study
the subject more, to practice,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:10%
and really get more into it.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:10%
He was so inspiring.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:10%
>> I then when I was 16 or
17 years old when I started

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:10%
catching.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:10%
He realized that no more I am
taking it as earlier as a child

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:10%
will do.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:10%
Somewhere he found
that I'm serious

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:10%
about it regularly doing.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:10%
And then, my father understood
that I'm really keen about it,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:10%
and he started instructing
me the right way

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:10%
of doing what has to be done--

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:10%
how I have to lift
myself, what has to be--

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:10%
what has to happen
in that asana,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:10%
if I'm straightening myself.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's straightening of
limbs or lifting of the spine.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We were fortunate in Pune
when we were here to see Guruji

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:90%
not just be the guru--

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:90%
a guru.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We saw him when he was
teaching, how he taught.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And he taught in a
way which was amazing.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
It was masterful
the way he taught.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:10%
>> In the classroom,
he was formidable.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
We were all in awe,
slightly scared.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely fearful and really
wondering whatever was going

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.020 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:10%
>> From the first time
he walked into the room,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:10%
into that yoga
hall, was, for me,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:10%
was just like a lightning
bolt. He was so relentless,

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and he was so challenging,
and he was so confronting,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:10%
but he was also
entirely captivating.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We would just whisper amongst
ourselves that the prowler has

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
entered the class, because
he really was like a lion.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.690 align:middle line:10%
And he would prowl
around the class

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:10%
with these leonine strides and
basically strike fear in your--

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:10%
in anybody's heart.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Like most many students, we
were very, very afraid of him.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The Guruji came into our
classes and stood near us.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
We would actually go
running to the prop room

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and stay there for some time
until we were hauled out of it.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:10%
>> To an outsider who
did not know Guruji,

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:10%
you would think that he was
sometimes very angry with

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:10%
the students.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But as teachers, we
realized that it was not

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the anger towards
these students,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:84%
but it was an anger towards
something which is not correct.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:10%
So there was no such
tolerance there for mistakes.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Sorry all are listening.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:10%
Not one adjusted.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:10%
I will not teach.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:10%
I will go back to India
today alone if you do not

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:10%
listen to what I say.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people used to
say that he's too strict.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:10%
But when you do something,
when you learn something,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:10%
so Guruji was the best.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Guruji used to say, it
is not tip of the fingers,

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:90%
top of the tip of the fingers.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I was surprised.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:10%
How can it be?

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:10%
Tip of the finger
itself is as a top.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
How can it be top of
the tip of the fingers?

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, see, this
is what the sensitiveness.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
The top of the tip of the
finger means it is so sensitive,

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
delicate, if you touch the
nose, the moment the finger goes

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to the nose, you
should know that.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:90%
You should feel it.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There was already an air
of excitement in the room,

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
because we knew that the Mr.
Iyengar had come in and was

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
beginning his daily
practice inside.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:10%
But after a while,
we forgot about him,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and we were focusing on
what the teacher was saying.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:10%
Until suddenly, there was this
roar from the back of the room.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:10%
No one is doing much she said.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:10%
And he marched up to
the front and took over,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:10%
and it was marvelous.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:10%
It was terrifying,
but it was marvelous.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:10%
>> He committed a mask to
discipline people rather than

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:10%
to spread fear.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:10%
>> When he was
hitting, shouting,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:10%
we knew that he was
right inside, outside.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
There was no doubt
that to remove

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
this wrong state of mind, he
had to drink in some manner

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
these wrong feelings,
wrong way of doing.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I was trying to do Bakasana
time after time after time,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:10%
and falling off,
and slipping off,

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:10%
and just getting frustrated.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:90%
And I was getting tired.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
And Rya had came walking
across the room up to me.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, Guruji
sent me over to tell you

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that you can't expect him
to come over to you if you

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:90%
want help with your pose.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I looked up at Rya and
said, OK, I'll come over.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And I walked over to
Guruji, and then he

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:84%
proceeded to put
me through my paces

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:84%
for another 20 minutes
of Bakasana practice,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
until I didn't even
realize that my arms were

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
numb from the elbow down,
until I fell out of the pose.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to break my
fall, and I couldn't even

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:90%
move my hands.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's
enough for today.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Did you learn something?

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:90%
And he wiggled his eyebrows.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:90%
And we laughed.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.963 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and then, the next
day, in the practice hall--

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
the numbness-- that's right,
the numbers didn't go away.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I was a
little worried, but I

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to bother him.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And I was over by the ropes.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to hold the rope,
but my hand wouldn't work.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And so he came over to me, and
he was so tender and sweet.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.315 align:middle line:84%
He took his kerchief out of his
pocket, and he wrapped my palm.

00:09:49.315 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, this
one's worse, right?

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.523 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes sir.

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:90%
The left one is worse.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And he wrapped my palm
in a very specific way.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was so surprised
and grateful.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, now,
do Bakasana again.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, no.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
He was generous, but
he was relentless.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>> We were all in Sirsasana--

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:10%
Salamba Sirsasana, head balance.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was walking through
the lines of people

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:90%
standing on their head.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And when he was coming
close to my place,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly felt something
pushing my chin.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't
realize immediately,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
but he was just standing
up straight in front of me.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually his
foot correcting my chin

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to go a little more
deep down to the floor.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:10%
>> He would exactly correct,
touching that spot which would

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:10%
make the person to do
everything rightly.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:10%
It was a special touch.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:10%
For example, let us say, he
may touch your shoulders,

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:10%
or he may touch your dorsal
spine somewhere, or somewhere

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:10%
spine at the lower area--

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:10%
lumbar spine or sacrum spine.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:10%
That touch will be not
much for you at that time,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:10%
but he will exactly touch
there, and the hole posture

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:10%
will change.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And you will come out of the
experience different-- totally

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:10%
different.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Once I was in
a particular pose,

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:10%
and he came from behind
and pushed my tailbone.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The comfort that I felt
after that is unimagined.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Some could say that
he had kicked me.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember one time, I was in
Sirsasana during the practice,

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't see him coming.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I felt was a
kick suddenly just here,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:90%
on the ribs.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So I had been sticking
my ribs out in Sirsasana.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and he kicked pretty hard,
and he just instantly

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:90%
pushed that part back.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And my back, buttocks,
and legs just went up.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I didn't fall.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But he had this way of
doing something like that,

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and just recently putting
you into a better pose.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.357 align:middle line:84%
He knew just how much
to kick and where,

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you would be
there in another pose.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It would just shift your
reality suddenly like that.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Other people would
say, didn't that hurt?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
That must have
really been awful.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, the touch
was very, very light.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It was light, but it lasted
for a very, very long time.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
His ability was to
bring something out

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in each student to let them have
their own personal experience.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
It was never a generalized
class experience in that way.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:10%
Without words, he
used to teach me.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>> He was able to be however
he needed to be for different

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
people, and he was able
to just switch instantly.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But the real impact, I found,
was in the experience that one

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:90%
had of oneself when he taught.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
When you were in his
classes, he opened up

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:90%
a sort of hidden potential.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
He showed you things,
or he led you,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.597 align:middle line:84%
brought you to things that you
never thought were possible.

00:13:20.597 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There was going
to be a mega class,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was going
to be-- the first time,

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.713 align:middle line:84%
there was going to be 1,000
students in the mega class.

00:13:25.713 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting here in
the library, and he says,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I think I can do 1,000
students-- meaning

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.432 align:middle line:84%
that all those other mega
classes that had like 300, 500,

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
700, he wouldn't
take that mega class

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
just because 300
people wanted to come,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
500 people wanted to come,
700 people wanted to come.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:84%
No, he had a kind of ethics that
if he couldn't see everyone,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't take that.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.287 align:middle line:84%
But he had that ability to see
that many people all at once.

00:13:52.287 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And he would correct people
in the far back of the room.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
He would point out
someone's tailbone

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
in the very back of the room,
someone else, thump their thigh

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like he has as many eyes
as many students are there that

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:10%
day.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
If there are 100
students, he has 100 eyes.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And he had
penetrative intelligence.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
He would go beyond the layers
of the body to go to the soul.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>> He certainly knew all
about one as a person.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:84%
When you met him,
there was no question

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:90%
of concealing anything.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:90%
He knew about you.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So he had seen me in class.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was laying
upside down, just--

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
really bhoga, not
yoga, I have to admit.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:84%
My eyes were closed, and
my hands were on the floor.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a piece of paper
being pushed into my hand.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:90%
So I opened my eyes.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:90%
My hand was on the floor.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And Guruji was
kneeling on the floor,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:90%
looking up at me in the robes.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, sir.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, give
this to Mary Dunn.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Mary Dunn was my wonderful
teacher in San Diego.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said, of course, sir.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But how did you know
that I know Mary Dunn?

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I saw you
in class this morning.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
You make the same
mistakes that she does.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>> He told me even before Isaac
was born that you are going

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to-- by the way, you are
carrying a male child.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Because many people
have said that Guruji

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:90%
is the man with the x-ray eyes.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So doesn't surprise me
that he already knew that.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember yawning
once in class,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:84%
but I had my back
of my head to him.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.753 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why
are you yawning?

00:15:36.753 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how do
you know I'm yawning?

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.628 align:middle line:90%
I've got my head to the back.

00:15:39.628 --> 00:15:42.391 align:middle line:84%
He says, your ears
move when you yawn.

00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:10%
>> If there is going something
going on in your mind,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:10%
he will recognize it.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:10%
He would take it jokingly.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:10%
Hey, where are you What are
you thinking, he may say.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you were in the
class and you were inattentive

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and weren't appreciating
that he was talking to you,

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.635 align:middle line:84%
then you would
certainly know about it.

00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:10%
>> He will exactly find out
what was going on in your mind--

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:10%
what was your brain doing.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:10%
And that was shocking.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:10%
How does he know?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:10%
>> This, I think, was
the quality of Guruji.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:10%
Without having to speak,
without having to tell him,

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:10%
without having to
show him anything,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:10%
he instinctively or
intuitively somehow

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:10%
knew the problems
of each person.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:10%
>> He is exactly
make out the defect--

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:10%
physical defect,
physiological defect.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:10%
>> He looked at me and he
diagnosed my problem without

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:10%
looking at my reports, but only
looking at my skin of the neck.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:10%
>> He never asked anyone
to bring the reports.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:10%
He never asked anyone go
tested, get pathological report

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:10%
or radiological report.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:10%
If somebody came
with it, he'd say--

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:10%
turn a blind eye.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to
look at all that.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:10%
She had his own
subjective diagnostics.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:10%
>> As far as the organic
body is concerned,

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:10%
he would be very sure, whether
kidneys have gone wrong,

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:10%
or heart is wrong,
or lungs are wrong.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:10%
>> How did he even
know about that?

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:10%
He had no educational
background on how cells work.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
There are no scientific
instruments he had--

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:84%
no microscopes,
nor stethoscopes.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:90%
But still he--

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how he
saw all those things.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:10%
>> He had his own scanning eyes.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:10%
Before the student
would say, Guruji, I've

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.930 align:middle line:10%
got this gastric problem
or a lung problem,

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:10%
he would divulge
it to the patient.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:10%
He would say, this
is your problem.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:10%
Say if you are tensed, he
won't look at your eyes.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:10%
He would look at your throat
and say you are tensed.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:10%
He looked at the gestures.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.390 align:middle line:10%
He looked at the throat.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:10%
He looked at the shoulders.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:10%
He used to say walk.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:10%
And when the person
walked before him,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:10%
he will know exactly what
is the matter with him.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:10%
And then, he starts
his teaching.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:10%
Greeta would ask,
because naturally, she

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:10%
would be surprised.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:10%
>> I asked him,
but he said, look,

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:10%
there is no method for that.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:10%
It's not something-- the
methodology to say that isn't--

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:10%
I talked to him in this manner.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:10%
But he gave me certain clues.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:10%
What clues?

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.010 align:middle line:10%
He said, look at his eyes--

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:10%
when I'm talking to him,
where he was looking.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:10%
Or the way he talks to me,
find out how he is answering.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:10%
Look at the posture,
how he is sitting.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:10%
These are the clues he gave me.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:10%
>> This was a great thing
that he had that faculty.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:10%
And no student ever bothered
how to get that faculty,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:10%
rather than depend upon the
pathologists and radiologists

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:10%
to tell us what this
person is suffering from.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of my closest
interactions with BKS Iyengar

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:10%
were during the remedial classes
or the medical classes here

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:10%
in Pune.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
was most interesting

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
about those interactions
were learning under him

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and the way he worked
psychologically differently

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:90%
with different people.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I was watching the
medical classes there.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And in those days, we
had to sit on stairs

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:10%
and had a great view
of the whole room.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And watching Guruji dart around
the room helping everyone,

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:90%
he just seemed like lightning.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't even see him move.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:84%
He would just be
somewhere, and then he

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
was somewhere else,
and somewhere else,

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and seemed to be helping
everyone at the same time.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:10%
>> The rhythm that he
would always get into.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:10%
And that was magnificent.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:10%
It's just the
exuberance of energy

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:10%
that was just magnificent.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And at one point, he came
to help a woman who was pretty

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
close to where we were
sitting on the stairs.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.005 align:middle line:84%
And he was helping
her to do drop backs.

00:19:56.005 --> 00:19:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And she was a
fairly young woman.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:10%
She had long braids
on either side.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:10%
And he was giving
her directions to get

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:10%
her to be able to drop back,
but she was nervous, of course,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:10%
and seemed afraid.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
She was very flexible, but she
seemed scared to drop back.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So he was helping her, but
she had couldn't really

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
take the directions that
he was saying to her.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, he
grabbed her two braids

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and pulled them down
and forward and up.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:10%
And she went right back
and did the drop back.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And she let out a
squeal and was so happy.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned to
her and turned to us

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and said, see how she
can open her chest now?

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I tell you, he was handling
the patient with his own hands.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.213 align:middle line:10%
>> Helping each individual
into the asanas.

00:20:50.213 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:10%
Many times, he used
to use his own head.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:10%
Like for example, you're lying
down in Supta Padangusthasana,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:10%
where one leg up and you're
lying down on the floor.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:10%
And he used to be
standing there behind

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:10%
and his head hitting out
towards the person's calves

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:10%
and with his hands pulling in.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Arms, legs, head,
neck, chest, back--

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:10%
everything he would make
use of to support it.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:10%
Not just standing nearby and
saying, do do, I will help you.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:10%
He knows exactly.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:10%
>> So he used to actually
make me sit in Baddha Konasana

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:10%
and fully himself used
to climb on my knees.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So entire Tata on
standing on top of me.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And I used to be really scared
in those initial days, but--

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:84%
it used to actually--
he actually creeped open

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
my groins like that,
to give that freedom

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and life over there.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:10%
>> I had streptococcus
infection in my throat,

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:10%
and it affected my
all small joints.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:10%
So rheumatoid
arthritis like that.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:10%
So I could not hold my pen.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:10%
I could not open the lock.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:10%
I could not hold the cooker.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:10%
Nothing I could do.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:10%
Then, when I came
in June to Pune,

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:10%
he made me to do many postures.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:10%
And especially full
arm balance, it

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:10%
was really-- my
doctors were surprised.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:10%
He put the slanting plank
and kept my palm on it.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:10%
And I used to do
full arm balance.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:10%
And slowly, my pain was gone.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:10%
And when I went back to Chennai,
the doctor say it is amazing,

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:10%
because this is cannot be cured.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:10%
Your father has done
something which is really--

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:10%
medical science tells
me it was surprising.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>> He's given life to many
people with medical issues,

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:10%
health issues.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:10%
>> I had a lot of trust
in him and I believed him.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:10%
And this finger-- he treated me.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.535 align:middle line:10%
I'm telling you, this was
tough for me, you know?

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:51.535 align:middle line:10%
Especially for a wicket
keeper, the index finger

00:22:51.535 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:10%
is very, very important
to collect the ball.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:10%
Everything come here.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:10%
And this finger was
treated by him totally.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:10%
And I still cry, literally.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:10%
And he used to push me so hard.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.012 align:middle line:10%
He was hanging on both
fingers, like this.

00:23:06.012 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And it's not only one minute,
two-- but it used to be there

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.803 align:middle line:10%
were five minutes, four minutes.

00:23:09.803 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:10%
Push me hard.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Now you will be amazed.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:10%
He used to put me in some poses.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:10%
where I could actually
palpitate my own kidney.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:10%
Very difficult to believe.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:10%
And nobody, of course,
today knows those

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.240 align:middle line:10%
poses or remembers those poses.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:10%
But til I was with him, my
blood pressure, kidney function,

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:10%
and everything else continued
to remain absolutely normal.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Then there were quite a few
who used to come with weakness

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:10%
in the arms, legs.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:10%
Standing itself was
difficult. There

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:10%
were physically challenged.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:10%
>> He could not be stipulating
the classical postures

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.252 align:middle line:10%
and actions of yoga.

00:23:54.252 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, he
thought that they should

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:10%
be given some assistance.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Suppose person having a
heart problem, blood pressure,

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:10%
this kind of patient.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:10%
So how to make them to
bend on the backside?

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:10%
>> So he understood that
if the asanas are to work,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:10%
one must be in the position.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, the
props were developed.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:10%
>> So you know you will be
surprised that he used to have

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:10%
whatever in the house
is small like bed.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:10%
And in those days, cotton bed
because you could roll it.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:10%
So cotton bed he will use.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:10%
The chapati roller, simple
thing, he will use it.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:10%
We had a stick--

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:10%
a simple wooden stick.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:10%
He will use that, and will
make that area to work.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I have left the
pain over here.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a
stick like this.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
He picked up a stick,
which was laying there.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is what you do.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And you do it a few times,
and your pain will be gone.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this pose is not
given in any yoga book

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the world.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Only Guruji could innovate it.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Only he could teach you this.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Things that I could not even
imagine could be used would

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:10%
prove to be such a valuable
aid in enlightening or showing

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:10%
something.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:10%
>> A couple of thing,
it came accidentally.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:10%
So there was a one belt
lying in the institute.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:10%
Then he just took the belt, put
it on the backside of his hand.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:10%
Then he would do Sarvangasana.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:10%
And he said, oh, my god.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:10%
Rather than telling to
people go on Sarvangasana

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:10%
and take your elbow back,
better lock his elbow now only

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:10%
in the belt and let him go.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:10%
>> So something should sustain
so that posture can work

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:10%
for remedy.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.640 align:middle line:10%
If you are sustaining
your body, the posture

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:10%
won't be really working to
disseminate the effects.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.590 align:middle line:10%
So that's why he developed
props for yoga to work on you.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.280 align:middle line:10%
If yoga doesn't work on you,
how will you get remedy?

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> He observed and he
incorporated props.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.970 align:middle line:90%
So did he invent props?

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I think he would
probably challenge that.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:10%
He would say, I observe nature
and do repeat something.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:10%
So is that invention?

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:90%
It certainly is.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It certainly is in
some perspective.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many people that
started call it as prop yoga.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So they have kind of
bought all the props.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:84%
They own it, but
they don't know how

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to use it, what to do,
or reach out to the cord.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:10%
>> And these days, I
keep on telling them,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:10%
you don't know what
hardship he had to make--

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:10%
to create these props, because
it has to suite the human body.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Guruji used to say,
this is a chumbal.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:10%
This is the Guruji's last
research of the prop.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2011, when he went
to China at the age of 93,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:84%
in front of the audience, which
was around 1,200 students from

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.720 align:middle line:90%
China, he said, look.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I've been teaching
for such a long time.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And till that time, when I
was doing Baddha Konasana,

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I used to put the wooden
brick, which was like a block.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I should have realized
that the bucket is shaped--

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.765 align:middle line:84%
it's curved and it's
rounded in shape.

00:26:55.765 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:10%
>> And the chumbal is what-- it
is taking that shape and giving

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:10%
you that support.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:90%
So I have been--

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.383 align:middle line:84%
this is what I've
invented now, and that's

00:27:02.383 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
what I've realized
now-- how stupid I've

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.310 align:middle line:90%
been to use a wooden block.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So small things
that he did, actually,

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
have touched me much more,
especially his simplicity,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and humility, and his
ability to say, you know,

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm still learning at the age
of 95, and the whole world--

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and to say it in public.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> He was always ready
to say, I do not know.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:84%
In spite of the fact that he
knew so much, if he did not

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:90%
know, he said he did not know.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Or he may-- there's a
problem which came up

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:90%
while he was teaching class.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And he, in his younger days, and
if he did not have the answer.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:90%
So he says, OK, I'll tell you.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Then he would practice
at home to find out

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
what is the real answer
to the question which

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:90%
has been posed to me.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's not just he's
going to try one thing

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:10%
and that's going to work.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.760 align:middle line:10%
Maybe even putting
himself in harm's way,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.635 align:middle line:10%
trying all different things.

00:27:46.635 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:10%
If he was going to prescribe
something to somebody,

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:10%
he wanted to know
what are the things

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:10%
that work, what doesn't work.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:10%
>> His body was
like a laboratory.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:10%
He would practice on it.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:10%
He was severe with himself,
not that he pampered his body.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:10%
He was a dedicated
practitioner himself.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And he was severe with
his body to experiment.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Therefore, he has often said,
when I teach, I am a scientist.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:10%
Actually, if you are teaching,
you should be a teacher.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:10%
But then, he never
had that opportunity.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:10%
He said, when I teach,
I am a scientist,

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:10%
because I have to
evolve person to person,

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:10%
what are the requirements.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.300 align:middle line:10%
If this person
requires this chair,

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:10%
somebody requires
a taller chair.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:10%
So he had to work that way.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.773 align:middle line:84%
>> He said that his students,
in a sense, were his teachers,

00:28:34.773 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:84%
because he saw what
mistakes they were making,

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:84%
or something that
they were doing right,

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:84%
which he probably
had not realized.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But he would meet
them and say, oh, this

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.267 align:middle line:84%
is something which
is new I am learning.

00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:84%
He was never a one way street
that means I know it all.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So he was, in that
sense, very scientific.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Just like in science, there's
always an inquisitiveness

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:90%
to know more about more things.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:84%
That kind of inquisitiveness
was certainly there, I can say.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:10%
>> His intelligence and
the way he introduced yoga,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.060 align:middle line:10%
the way he studied every day
in the library the yoga texts,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:10%
his explanations.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:10%
And he was amazing,
that a man who

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:10%
had had no academic education
had such a lot of knowledge

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:10%
about this line.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So when he was writing
the Yoga Sutra Patanjali,

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:10%
the text was ready, but he was
telling me that there are lots

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:10%
of things that he would like
to experience before being sure

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:10%
and to put them on the page.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we reached it in '92 to
the final editing of the work.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In the same place
in this library,

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
almost on the same table, I
was doing the editing work,

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and one of my friends I was
entering them in the computer,

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and Guruji was supervising
the whole work.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.690 align:middle line:84%
When we reached Yoga Sutra, that
the meaning was not very clear,

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and his explanations, also,
we were trying to write.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was not
really corresponding.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:90%
It was not very convincing.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:90%
We were working day and night.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And one night-- it was around
4:00 in the morning-- somebody

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
knocked on my door, because
I was living upstairs

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.420 align:middle line:90%
in the institute.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:90%
And then, I opened the door.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:90%
It was Guruji himself.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, can I enter?

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I told, of course you can
enter, but I am sorry.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:90%
I am just coming out.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Go back to your bed.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.610 align:middle line:90%
He pushed me back to my bed.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:90%
My friend also was in his bed.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And he sat on the
side of my bed.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And he explained,
amazingly, very clearly,

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
like a really crystal
clear, the Sutra.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Then he told, now
is it understood?

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And we told, yes, you
can write it like that.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Then he walked away and
we watched ourselves.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that it was just
coming from his own practice

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:90%
in that very morning.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There was one practice where
he had his leg up on the tall

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.950 align:middle line:84%
stool, and I was just
there next to him,

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.612 align:middle line:84%
just literally this
far away from him.

00:31:02.612 --> 00:31:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And I was watching him.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And over two minutes,
every two seconds,

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.650 align:middle line:84%
he would shift and do
something a little different,

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:84%
catch the imprint
of that, and then do

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:84%
another thing for two seconds,
then catch the imprint of that.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you count that
up over two minutes--

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
30 seconds one minute, 30
seconds the other minute--

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:84%
he did like 60 different
trials within two minutes.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
He had that speed of being able
to catch what was happening,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.520 align:middle line:84%
record it, and then just
go on to the next thing.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Just an incredible speed.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Even well into his 90s,
he would be discovering new

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:10%
things.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:10%
He would be discussing this
with Geeta aunty or Prashantji.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.160 align:middle line:10%
Yesterday, I was trying
this for the last two days.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:10%
In Sirsasana, I was doing
this particular variation.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:10%
And I spent 10 extra minutes.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:10%
And this is what I felt. There's
a relief in a certain thing

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:10%
that I felt.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> He never stopped practicing.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.030 align:middle line:90%
He never stopped learning.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.660 align:middle line:84%
He never stopped exploring
and experimenting.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>> He made this voyage
from the outside in.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And he did that while
having a loving marriage.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> If he has any success, it was
because that [INAUDIBLE] that

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:23.010 align:middle line:84%
energy, that Shakti was
Ramamani, his wife, behind him.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> She's a light in my life.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:84%
She never demanded
anything from me.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:10%
>> She could definitely make out
that he has something different

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:10%
in him.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:10%
So she gave full
support, full freedom,

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.560 align:middle line:10%
to him whatever he wants to do.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:10%
Always together
used to practice.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.990 align:middle line:10%
She never objected.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:10%
Early mornings is to get up
at 4:00 to do the practice.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:10%
She never objected.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:10%
She would help.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> After marry, my progress
on yoga is on account of her.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:90%
I use her as a mirror.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:10%
>> They had a really good
understanding of each other.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:10%
He respected my mother
as a householder,

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.140 align:middle line:10%
looking after everything--
looking after the house,

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:10%
children, kitchen, everything.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:10%
>> He used to take
her for shopping.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:10%
You see, every Sunday, my
father used to come from Bombay.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:10%
And he used to
reach Pune by 3:30.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.070 align:middle line:10%
By 4:35, my father used to
take my mother for shopping.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Many times Sunday, he used
to go to Dadar and bring betel

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:10%
leaves, because my
mother used to like it.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:10%
On Sunday night, we used
to go for for the walking.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:10%
And my mother, by walking, she
used to make veeda for him.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:10%
And they used to have--
on the road, also,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.340 align:middle line:10%
so she used to have on
one finger, [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.680 align:middle line:10%
and another finger leaves.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:10%
We used to wash everything--
clean it, everything.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.350 align:middle line:10%
And while going,
they used to eat it.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Never they fought
with each other.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.010 align:middle line:10%
Never there was a quarrel
or fight, in front of us,

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:10%
especially.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:10%
It never happened.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:07.200 align:middle line:10%
It at all, they had spoken
to each other so differently.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:10%
But there are not
quarrel, as such.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.860 align:middle line:10%
No argument, as such.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> She was really wonderful
lady-- very tolerant lady,

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:90%
very helpful lady.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And looking after everyone
with kind heartedness.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Both of us lived very
happily for 30 years.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.860 align:middle line:10%
>> But after passing
of my mother,

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.570 align:middle line:10%
he was both mother and father.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:10%
>> He use to play with
us, especially myself.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm being the eldest daughter
of Guruji, of my father.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.400 align:middle line:10%
I think I enjoyed a lot.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.859 align:middle line:10%
>> We used to play on his body
when he used to do practices

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:10%
in different asanas,
like Halasana.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:10%
We use to play slide.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.690 align:middle line:10%
When he used to
do Yoganidrasana,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.770 align:middle line:10%
we used to play like
see-saw on his body.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:10%
>> You won't believe it, even at
this-- as a three years child,

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:07.250 align:middle line:10%
I was always doing in front of
him something like toppling.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, I'd touch my toes.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.970 align:middle line:10%
When he jumped, I will jump.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I was a
classical dancer,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.740 align:middle line:10%
so I was supposed to give
my first performance.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:25.070 align:middle line:10%
So, in front of him, I used to
do the practice all the time.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:30.250 align:middle line:10%
So when he used to correct
me during these yoga postures

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:10%
and all, he used to correct me.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.510 align:middle line:10%
But even when I
used to have a bath,

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.390 align:middle line:10%
he used to come
after having a bath

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.970 align:middle line:10%
and tell me that,
Savita, come on.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:10%
Do this.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:10%
So even during the bath,
he was thinking about my--

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.060 align:middle line:10%
how I had to improve my
dance with their expressions,

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:10%
with the gestures, with
the hand movements.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Hand movements,
palm movements.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.670 align:middle line:10%
He was graceful, actually.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to learn,
actually, dance.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:10%
>> He was thinking about
actually becoming a classical

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.890 align:middle line:10%
dancer rather than practitioner
of yoga at some stage in life.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's why he once saw
Uday Shankar in a ballet.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.040 align:middle line:10%
And he was so fascinated.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.520 align:middle line:10%
Then he said, why
not find out the way

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.920 align:middle line:10%
that I will teach him yoga,
and he will teach me dance.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:10%
>> But Uday Shankar was not
interested in yoga, it seems.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.190 align:middle line:10%
So he could not continue.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:10%
But music, he was
very much interested.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:10%
Both my parents were interested
in music to the point that

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:10%
the interest was in
everybody's-- all the siblings.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.470 align:middle line:10%
And I used to play sitar for
my another sister Sunita.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.270 align:middle line:10%
Prashant and Vanita,
they used to play violin.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.920 align:middle line:10%
Savita danced.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:10%
Geeta learned vocal
music, then sitar, also.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:10%
So he used to teach us the
technique, how to play--

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:10%
fingering work, wrist work,
and everything he used to tell.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And it used to make a lot of
difference in the technique.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Renowned and famous and
a great teacher as he was,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.280 align:middle line:10%
but when it came to
normal family life,

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:10%
he was just like any ordinary
man-- like a very common man.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:10%
And that was very
endearing about him.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.630 align:middle line:10%
>> In the house, as a father,
he was very much lovable.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.800 align:middle line:10%
At the same time,
he was very strict.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.220 align:middle line:10%
>> He was not at all
strict whatsoever to me.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Actually, when his classes
were going on and while he used

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:10%
to practice, it should
be pin drop silence.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.650 align:middle line:10%
We children never used
to make any noise.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:10%
He never used to like that.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:10%
But when and children were
playing, he used to practice.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:10%
They used to play cricket.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:10%
And he was also sometimes
laughing, playing with them.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Used to play with him a lot.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:10%
And he used to
practice as you go--

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.283 align:middle line:10%
He would be practicing
in the hallway.

00:37:44.283 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:10%
I used to go in the
hall, trouble him.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:10%
If he's sleeping, stand
on his legs or whatever.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.528 align:middle line:10%
Just play with him.

00:37:49.528 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:10%
>> He had this thing
he used to say--

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.750 align:middle line:10%
OK, I'll make you fly
like an aeroplane.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:57.280 align:middle line:10%
So he used to lay down on
his back and hold us like--

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:10%
so we are kids, right?

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So we are on-- so
his legs up, and we

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.280 align:middle line:84%
are laying flat on his
legs and holding his hands.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And he is making us
fly like an aeroplane.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes in the morning,
when we would be sleeping late

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and we would not wake up,
suddenly we would be woken up,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:84%
because he would be
walking on our legs.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Then he would just laugh,
and he would walk off.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> He was like a child--

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.260 align:middle line:84%
full of life, full
of fun, his eyes

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.020 align:middle line:84%
twinkling with mischief,
with that mischievous

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:90%
smile on his face.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.700 align:middle line:90%
He was ready for an adventure.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So there are times
when we would have done

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:32.790 align:middle line:90%
some crazy things with him.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:10%
And he would be ready for a game
of cricket, or sit on a swing,

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.880 align:middle line:10%
or be ready to stand on
his head in Sirsasana

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.290 align:middle line:10%
on the edge of a cliff--

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.343 align:middle line:10%
challenge us to do
things which he did.

00:38:43.343 --> 00:38:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we were at
the top of the hill,

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:84%
he used to like to go to
the edge and to sort of do

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.030 align:middle line:90%
the adventurous thing.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.575 align:middle line:90%
And he used to take us along.

00:38:50.575 --> 00:38:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And our parents, my
father, was scared.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.033 align:middle line:90%
Hey, don't go there.

00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:54.555 align:middle line:90%
You'll fall down.

00:38:54.555 --> 00:38:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So I remember once, we had
been to the Nandi Hills.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
place called Tipu Drop.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's where Tipu Sultan, he
used to push down his enemies.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So there is like a very steep
fall and there is a wall.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And the wall doesn't even like--

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
the comparable kind of a wall,
it doesn't have a flat surface.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It was a curved
surface on top of it.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.900 align:middle line:90%
And so that does--

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:90%
so he got up on the wall.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But there's a steep
fall on the other side.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:84%
He's wearing his
[INAUDIBLE] and was sort

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.130 align:middle line:90%
of walking like a king.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And we are all scared,
because it's very windy

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and the other side
is totally steep.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And he's laughing.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.258 align:middle line:84%
So he's enjoying
walking like that.

00:39:31.258 --> 00:39:32.758 align:middle line:84%
And he's calling
us-- you also come.

00:39:32.758 --> 00:39:33.670 align:middle line:90%
You also climb.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And we had once gone on a
family picnic to Mulshi during

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.420 align:middle line:90%
the monsoon.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.313 align:middle line:84%
So Guruji stopped
the car and said--

00:39:40.313 --> 00:39:41.230 align:middle line:90%
he said, stop the car.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.860 align:middle line:90%
This will be our picnic spot.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:90%
So there was a mild waterfall.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.360 align:middle line:90%
There was some slippery rocks.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.600 align:middle line:10%
And we all just sat
there, opened up

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.210 align:middle line:10%
what we'd got for eating, and
laughing, playing in the water.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And he called out to me.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, hey,
do Sirsasana her.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was so terrified.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, do.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can not do,
because I can not balance.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:04.810 align:middle line:90%
He said, somebody will hold you.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.060 align:middle line:90%
So what if you can no balance?

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Just do the pose.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I am fighting with my
grandfather at that time,

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
trying to convince
my grandfather

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that this granddaughter
can balance in Sirsasana.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
teacher in him came out.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you
don't do it now--

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and he said, I will do it.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So I got doubly terrified that
it's so slippery, [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and, you know, water.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But Guruji is
saying, I will do it.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:84%
If something happens,
what will my family think?

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.900 align:middle line:84%
What will-- they'll
point fingers at me.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So the stress-- that stress
made me do Sirsasana.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me something
in that Sirsasana, also.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> At home, this used
to happen very often,

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:84%
where suddenly he'd say,
[INAUDIBLE] come here.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you something.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:90%
And he's teaching us.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So if you're doing--

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.720 align:middle line:84%
like say you're doing
Urdva Dhanurasana.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.625 align:middle line:90%
So you'll fall and you come up.

00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So he had this way of-- he
used to just hold us out

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of the tip of the
[INAUDIBLE] there.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we had to come
up, he'd just do a small tug,

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.743 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to
come up very fast.

00:41:04.743 --> 00:41:06.410 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like he
would just say, see,

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.463 align:middle line:90%
I have magic in my hand.

00:41:07.463 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I just pull, and
you're able to come up.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Even in the family
lunch occasion,

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:84%
sometimes after lunch he would
say, hey, come do Sirsasana.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell
him, no, grandfather.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I just ate.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
nothing will happen.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Do.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of yoga
anytime, laughter anytime,

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.600 align:middle line:90%
teasing me anytime.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:90%
So that always was on.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:31.377 align:middle line:10%
>> He used to be always
excited like a child when his

00:41:31.377 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:10%
grandchildren and great
grandchildren were around,

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.842 align:middle line:10%
especially.

00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:36.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I couldn't resist
taking Guruji's car.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.140 align:middle line:10%
It was an Ambassador
at that point in time.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.563 align:middle line:10%
And I'd take it
out, and he used--

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:41.200 align:middle line:10%
I used to ask him,
Tata, are you coming?

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And he would not bat an eyelid.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.627 align:middle line:10%
He would say, yes, let's go.

00:41:43.627 --> 00:41:44.740 align:middle line:10%
Let's have fun.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:10%
The man loved life.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:46.780 align:middle line:10%
He was full of life.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.490 align:middle line:10%
And that time, I didn't realize.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:10%
I used to just take him.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.895 align:middle line:10%
He would just wear his
slippers and we would just

00:41:51.895 --> 00:41:53.728 align:middle line:10%
go and come back after
an hour, going around

00:41:53.728 --> 00:41:55.592 align:middle line:10%
on hills around Pune.

00:41:55.592 --> 00:41:56.800 align:middle line:10%
That point, I didn't realize.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.170 align:middle line:10%
At the age of 18 and
19, I didn't realize.

00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.003 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I asked my Tata.

00:41:59.003 --> 00:41:59.803 align:middle line:10%
He came.

00:41:59.803 --> 00:42:00.640 align:middle line:10%
What's the big deal?

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.780 align:middle line:10%
You take it for granted.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, you realize the amount of
trust he had in my driving--

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.866 align:middle line:10%
the amount implicit trust.

00:42:06.866 --> 00:42:09.510 align:middle line:10%
The fact that he would
take his time out.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.257 align:middle line:10%
Nowadays, at the age
of 38, and I work,

00:42:12.257 --> 00:42:13.590 align:middle line:10%
and I help around the institute.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:10%
And I have a kid and
I know how busy it is.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:10%
An hour is a big
deal in my life.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:10%
But at that time, for Guruji
to spend an hour of his life

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.990 align:middle line:10%
every Saturday, Sunday, just
so that I can have my fancy

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:10%
and drive around Pune,
that's unbelievable.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Nowadays, we find it
very difficult. One thing,

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.500 align:middle line:10%
if we do it.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.590 align:middle line:10%
Another thing, we say
[INAUDIBLE] I can't come.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:39.250 align:middle line:10%
But he used to practice, take
the classes, come to the shops,

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:10%
and we used to dine
together always.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Those Small Pleasures
in life, you know?

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:84%
That he used to be
in one day and he

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.180 align:middle line:84%
was to participate
very enthusiastically.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.270 align:middle line:84%
He used to watch
television-- cricket matches.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:56.960 align:middle line:84%
He used to come with us
on long drives or picnics.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.750 align:middle line:90%
He used to play games with us.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:10%
>> All games he used to enjoy--

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:10%
football, hockey, cricket.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:10%
And Gilli Danda, you know?

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.580 align:middle line:10%
That Gilli Danda.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:11.880 align:middle line:10%
He used to play with
us when we were young.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.230 align:middle line:10%
>> He was always a sportsman.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:17.050 align:middle line:10%
Basically, he was a
sportsman in that way--

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.750 align:middle line:10%
the yoga he took.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Actually, nobody guided him to
play any sports or anything.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.240 align:middle line:10%
He was very fond of cricket.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.690 align:middle line:10%
>> That is why the radio
came to our house to list

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.490 align:middle line:10%
to the commentaries.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:10%
>> I remember it was the
Champion's Trophy final,

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.540 align:middle line:10%
I guess--

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.590 align:middle line:10%
India versus England.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.110 align:middle line:10%
Last time, India won the
Champion's Trophy in England.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:10%
So we were watching it in Pune.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.328 align:middle line:10%
And everybody had gone to sleep.

00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:43.620 align:middle line:10%
We were the only peoples awake.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.470 align:middle line:10%
The match went on til
12:30 or 1:00 our time.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:49.040 align:middle line:10%
India won the match and
we were watching that.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Not only cricket--
football, especially.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.820 align:middle line:10%
Local football is something
we used to watch together.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.220 align:middle line:10%
And the last finals
one month ago

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:10%
was the first finals
that in around--

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.890 align:middle line:10%
after five straight finals,
I did not watch with Guruji--

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:10%
'98 to 2018.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:10%
So it was a little emotional
watching the match alone.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.690 align:middle line:10%
Watching Investigative
detective shows on TV

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:10%
on a Friday or Saturday night,
accompanied by cold coffee

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:10%
is something he used to love.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Every Friday night, it's
going to be a cold coffee

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.770 align:middle line:90%
night.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So myself and Hadid, my husband,
we used to make cold coffee.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.990 align:middle line:84%
We give him, and he would
say, oh, it's too strong,

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.125 align:middle line:90%
Da, It's too light, Da.

00:44:33.125 --> 00:44:34.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Little less sugar.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.220 align:middle line:10%
Little more sugar.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:10%
The blend is a little less.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.380 align:middle line:10%
You should do this more.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.963 align:middle line:10%
You should take this
kind of a vessel.

00:44:39.963 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:10%
Many multiple instructions.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> He had this thing about
creating your dishes.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Put honey in this, and
mix this with that,

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and see how it tastes.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.320 align:middle line:90%
So that was a lot of fun.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Simple things like festivals
he used to enjoy a lot.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So we used to prepare
this [INAUDIBLE],,

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:90%
like the Diwali snacks.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:90%
He was to enjoy all of it.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.610 align:middle line:90%
He used to eat heartily.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.890 align:middle line:84%
He used to make us
also eat heartily.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of the course,
there would always be a big

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.970 align:middle line:84%
meal essentially
sponsored by the family.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.390 align:middle line:84%
All my aunts, my mother,
all of them would cook.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.670 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have any kitchen.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:84%
The highlight would be that
there is some fruit salad.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Fruit salad was
like an specialty.

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And we'd all sit in
the hall downstairs.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And Guruji would insist
on us serving everybody.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:84%
He would make sure everybody
took a second helping,

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:27.370 align:middle line:90%
third helping.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And I remember that he gave
me so many jalebis to eat.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I kept putting them on my plate.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I really had a hard
time finishing them.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But because Guruji had given
them, it was like Prasad,

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:90%
you have to eat them.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:90%
So I really ate all of it.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- my stomach
was probably also hurting.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.940 align:middle line:90%
So he smiled.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I told him that's
too much for me.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So he just smiled and
said, go out to the hall

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and do some [INAUDIBLE],,
and everything will be fine.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And I did it.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And believe me,
actually, it helped.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It really helped me
digest all those jalebis.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So in him I found this
father figure-- very caring,

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.740 align:middle line:90%
very generous, very, very warm--

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:90%
full of love, full of affection.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was amazed to see how
this man could be at the same

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.470 align:middle line:84%
time a guru, a
yogi, a [INAUDIBLE],,

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.640 align:middle line:84%
a father for his children,
a grandfather for his

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.360 align:middle line:84%
grandchildren, a teacher
for his students,

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and an amazing friend.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.812 align:middle line:10%
>> He was my very good friend.

00:46:25.812 --> 00:46:27.570 align:middle line:10%
He was my guru.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:10%
He was my everything.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.550 align:middle line:10%
He was for me like father.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:38.050 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:43.380 align:middle line:10%
She's like my daughter, so
you have to look after her.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:50.760 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.520 align:middle line:10%
>> You felt such a deep
connection with him.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.320 align:middle line:10%
It was surprising
how many people

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:10%
said this over and over again.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anybody else who
connects with people like that.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I've never met anyone
who has that ability.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Because one of hi main
quality is that he was not

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.680 align:middle line:10%
at all selfish.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.550 align:middle line:10%
Not at all.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What's not to like about him?

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:22.170 align:middle line:90%
I really don't understand.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.150 align:middle line:90%
He focused things very easily.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The moment you fight with
him, the next moment he just

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.460 align:middle line:90%
forgets.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:10%
>> We had a heated
argument, myself and Guruji,

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:37.010 align:middle line:10%
regarding our trust
activities only.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:40.180 align:middle line:10%
I was travelling from Bellur
and he called me over phone.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.060 align:middle line:10%
I was in the car only.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:10%
We both had a heated
argument over the phone.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.480 align:middle line:10%
And in the family, everybody
was [INAUDIBLE] Pone

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.390 align:middle line:10%
what will happen?

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:54.350 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE] argue
over phone itself.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.460 align:middle line:10%
Then after five minutes,
he had called me

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:10%
again laughing and enjoying.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I have not seen
anybody like that.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.997 align:middle line:90%
My ego comes into my way.

00:48:03.997 --> 00:48:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, you
fought with me, right?

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.942 align:middle line:84%
So let me be angry
for some time,

00:48:07.942 --> 00:48:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to talk
to you for some time.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Let me be.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it's never
the same with him.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Even in his
most angry moments,

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:84%
he would waggle his eyebrows
a little bit at you,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and there would be that
twinkle in his eye,

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.308 align:middle line:90%
even while he was reprimanding.

00:48:22.308 --> 00:48:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It can happen even when
he's calling you in a class,

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.820 align:middle line:84%
or it can happen when
he's pulling your leg.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But, he used to have a twinkle
on the side of his glance.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And he was just--

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and used to smile a certain way.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> He saw one of his
students, Dr. [INAUDIBLE],,

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.850 align:middle line:90%
sort of walk into the hallway.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Then he said,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:84%
That means, I'm going
to have some fun.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So now, [INAUDIBLE] is
a student of Guruji.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And he take everything
that Guruji says seriously.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So Guruji called
him and says, oh,

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.740 align:middle line:84%
do you know that you
are leaning on one side?

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.300 align:middle line:10%
So whether he was
leaning or not,

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.310 align:middle line:10%
he thought that if
Guruji's saying something,

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:00.550 align:middle line:10%
then it must be true.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.790 align:middle line:90%
So he says, yes sir.

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:03.300 align:middle line:90%
So he says, OK, you know why?

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.030 align:middle line:84%
He says, no sir, expecting
Guruji to tell him

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:08.580 align:middle line:84%
how he was-- his
weight was going

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.580 align:middle line:84%
on to one side or
something like that.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, see
when you were shaving,

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.750 align:middle line:84%
you have cut your
mustache at one end.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It is cut more than the other,
and that's why you are leaning.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I can guarantee you
that his sense of humor was

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.100 align:middle line:90%
unbelievable.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.510 align:middle line:10%
His zest for life, living
life to the fullest,

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.140 align:middle line:10%
was unbelievable and you can
see some good photographers

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.300 align:middle line:10%
have captured that--

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.270 align:middle line:10%
the sheer openness.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.210 align:middle line:10%
He's just in the
moment laughing.

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Guruji's laugh was beautiful.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.100 align:middle line:10%
It was like a child.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.840 align:middle line:10%
He would love wholeheartedly.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.690 align:middle line:10%
No doubt.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> He used to crack
jokes, play pranks.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.970 align:middle line:90%
And those jokes were cutting.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:90%
They were timely, they're apt.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] was
taking a class,

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and what we did was we had like
a prank planned, essentially.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning of
the class, there were--

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:90%
prayers were there, looking on.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.030 align:middle line:84%
All the prayers-- probably,
we're saying the prayers.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And while he was
doing that, one of us

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.500 align:middle line:84%
just went and kept a
water balloon behind him.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.728 align:middle line:84%
And we thought he'd get
up and he'd get all wet,

00:50:01.728 --> 00:50:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and it'd be a lot of fun.

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:05.830 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, that was a
very funny thing at the time.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.230 align:middle line:84%
He just didn't move
far enough or whatever.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.680 align:middle line:90%
The balloon was in its place.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And we hadn't notice Guruji
had just entered the class

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:14.740 align:middle line:90%
and he had seen this.

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:90%
We had no idea.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.370 align:middle line:90%
We were sitting in the class.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:90%
We were saying our prayers.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.083 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that the
prank hadn't worked,

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.500 align:middle line:84%
so he walked all
the way to Pandu.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.917 align:middle line:84%
He said, hey,
Pandu, what is this?

00:50:22.917 --> 00:50:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And he pushed him back.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.260 align:middle line:90%
And that was hilarious.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And I remembered
Guruji on his veranda,

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.930 align:middle line:10%
on his own little terrace.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:35.630 align:middle line:90%
And it was [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was waiting for the
kids to come out of the class.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So the kids come
out of the class,

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and Guruji threw the
water and drenched them.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.090 align:middle line:90%
And the shrieks and laughter.

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And Guruji was laughing,
like real laughter.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:59.290 align:middle line:10%
So that was one of the
first kind of interaction,

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:04.090 align:middle line:10%
seeing him with kids.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>> He could gel with
people of any age.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So with my baby, or with any
baby, he would play with them,

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:14.995 align:middle line:84%
bring a smile on their
faces, or make them--

00:51:14.995 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:84%
even when the baby couldn't
speak, the baby would respond.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>> In his hands [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.030 align:middle line:90%
He held you as a wee baby.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And he just picked
[INAUDIBLE] up.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And his hands were so
sure and so steady.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And he looked into
the small baby's face,

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and he just said, yes sir,
you have seen many lifetimes.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And which one are you in now?

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> When I look back at
photographs of Guruji with

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.900 align:middle line:84%
my daughter, it does
something to me.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:49.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.408 align:middle line:84%
I can't pick think of
a word to say what.

00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So I still remember the
day that I walked home

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:58.220 align:middle line:84%
with the baby in my
hand from the hospital.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And Guruji was sitting,
and he was the first person

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:04.660 align:middle line:90%
I handed out the baby to.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And Guruji fondling the baby,
still I vividly remember that.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So after she grew
up a little bit,

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:14.710 align:middle line:84%
my father would
bring her every day

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to the institute, where
Guruji was either in the class

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:19.520 align:middle line:90%
or in the practice.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So Guruji would very playfully
would love, cajole her, or put

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.930 align:middle line:84%
her on some prop and make
her slide down the prop.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> As my children grew up, I
think they grew up to think

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:90%
they had three grandfathers--

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.990 align:middle line:84%
two were their
biological grandfathers,

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and the other was Guruji,
who they would look forward

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to coming and
meeting on occasions.

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he would be kind
of fooling around with them,

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.170 align:middle line:84%
chuckling away, asking
them little questions.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So they were very happy
to interact with him,

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't think that
he was a big man, or even

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.260 align:middle line:90%
a grown man.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I remember times when my
children would put their--

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.660 align:middle line:84%
my son, he would put his arms
around his neck and swing

00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.470 align:middle line:90%
on his back.

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I remember, I have memories
of playing with him outside

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.590 align:middle line:10%
in the courtyard
of the Institute.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And we'd be jumping on
him, and he'd play with us.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And I remember him
smiling and laughing.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Guruji, as far as I remember,
was the most lovable older man

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:90%
that we knew.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was 11 and I
had joined the institute

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.950 align:middle line:84%
in the children's class,
which my mom, Kathy,

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.930 align:middle line:84%
was taking and teaching
with [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:28.347 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was essentially the
first children's class that

00:53:28.347 --> 00:53:29.290 align:middle line:90%
they had in Pune.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.610 align:middle line:10%
>> And Guruji would come
into our classes on a Sunday

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:32.410 align:middle line:10%
morning.

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:34.940 align:middle line:10%
I think he enjoyed being
in the children's classes.

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't recognize him
to be our guru at the time.

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:40.900 align:middle line:84%
He was just someone who was fun,
who would come into our class

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and bounce us about.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We used to often be bribed
with five star chocolates

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:47.200 align:middle line:90%
to do certain asanas.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said, you think
you're a five star, huh?

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.420 align:middle line:90%
You think you're a five star.

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And he gave me this chocolate.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So I think we had a very
relaxed relationship with Guruji

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.090 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:53:58.090 --> 00:53:59.485 align:middle line:90%
>> It was so much fun.

00:53:59.485 --> 00:54:02.245 align:middle line:84%
Different, because Guruji
was different with the kids.

00:54:02.245 --> 00:54:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
laughter and nonsense.

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:10.557 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, Guruji
knew that if you--

00:54:10.557 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:84%
children, there's a
different mindset.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't [INAUDIBLE] to stay
in a pose for 10 minutes.

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:15.923 align:middle line:90%
They're just going to get bored.

00:54:15.923 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:90%
So he devised a new set of--

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and a new way of teaching.

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:84%
It was more dynamic,
more active,

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:25.570 align:middle line:84%
to keep kids like us more
interested and not get bored.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We had other teachers
taking the classes,

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.270 align:middle line:84%
but when Guruji used to come,
it was always a special day.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And often, when he used
to come, he didn't really

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.150 align:middle line:90%
announce his coming.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.990 align:middle line:84%
He'd sort of sneakily
come in the back, hiding.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, some boy would see
that Guruji is in the class,

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:42.965 align:middle line:90%
in the hall.

00:54:42.965 --> 00:54:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, the whisper
used to go around.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:45.246 align:middle line:90%
Guruji's here.

00:54:45.246 --> 00:54:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Guruji's here.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.845 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, everybody's
poses are 100 times better,

00:54:48.845 --> 00:54:50.470 align:middle line:84%
because they all know
that he is there.

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:52.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Oftentimes, even if
somebody else was taking it,

00:54:52.595 --> 00:54:56.150 align:middle line:84%
if Pandu was taking it, he would
just come in, halfway through

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:84%
the class, and be
standing in the corner.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as he entered
the class, all of us

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.292 align:middle line:84%
knew that, OK, now this
was going to be fun.

00:55:03.292 --> 00:55:05.125 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he would
take over-- immediately,

00:55:05.125 --> 00:55:06.830 align:middle line:90%
he would take over.

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:08.330 align:middle line:84%
He would let Pandu
or whoever teach,

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and he would say, hey,
that's not the way to teach.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.007 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way to do it.

00:55:12.007 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Come, I'll show you.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And then onwards, it
was tremendous fun.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.543 align:middle line:84%
Very, very-- he would be
two steps ahead of us.

00:55:18.543 --> 00:55:19.960 align:middle line:84%
He would ask-- he
would do things.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.960 align:middle line:84%
He would say names of
asanas, or he would do it,

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and we had to follow.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was extremely
fast and a lot of fun.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.000 align:middle line:84%
We would always
enjoy these classes.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I give full credit to Guruji
for highlighting that fact,

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.400 align:middle line:90%
that teaching is almost--

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.160 align:middle line:84%
it's a science, and one needs to
have many tools, many methods,

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:47.210 align:middle line:84%
to be able to communicate with
people who are all different.

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:50.800 align:middle line:10%
>> The thing that Guruji always
taught us is not to teach

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.000 align:middle line:10%
anything that you
don't understand.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, one of the things that
he gave us, as well as practice

00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.640 align:middle line:84%
for just our life, is
practice for our teaching.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was not
really a teacher,

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:10.600 align:middle line:84%
my teacher in San Diego had
asked me to substitute classes

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.010 align:middle line:84%
for another teacher who was
pregnant and not feeling well

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:14.810 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So I had taught
two classes, maybe.

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was at this
time that Guruji

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:23.990 align:middle line:84%
was in San Diego
after a convention.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And he came to our center.

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was so funny, because
he asked all of the teachers

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:35.500 align:middle line:90%
to teach in front of him.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you have any memory of
teaching in front of Guruji,

00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:43.160 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you could get
four or five words out

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.280 align:middle line:84%
before he'd stop you
and make a correction.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So he went through all
the teachers in San Diego.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And he put his
hands on his hips,

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and he turned to my
teacher and said,

00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:57.090 align:middle line:90%
don't you have anybody else?

00:56:57.090 --> 00:57:00.333 align:middle line:84%
And my teacher turned to me
and said, well, there's Mary.

00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.320 align:middle line:90%
So Guruji said, teach.

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Teach something.

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.880 align:middle line:90%
So I taught [INAUDIBLE] asana.

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And the students, they
weren't putting their heels

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:15.015 align:middle line:90%
down on their back leg.

00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, put your heel down.

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Press your heel down.

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Stamp your heel down.

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And inside my head, I was
saying, please, please, please

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:27.290 align:middle line:84%
put your heel down, because
Guruji is watching me.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And Guruji interrupted
and said, do you

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:34.340 align:middle line:84%
want me to tell you
how to tell them?

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes sir.

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank god.

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And he turned
around very quickly,

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and he said, unlatch
your heel to the floor.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a thud in the
room as 50 heels went down

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.720 align:middle line:90%
to the floor.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And he turned to me and
he said, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.970 align:middle line:10%
>> When Patricia Walden and I
went to Pune to ask Guruji what

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:58.670 align:middle line:10%
we're going to do when
he is no more, he said,

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:03.800 align:middle line:10%
when you practice, practice
with honesty and integrity.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you're teaching,
observe your students.

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I teach,
what I teach,

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:13.500 align:middle line:84%
how I teach is directly
influenced by Guruji.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Guruji really gave us a way
of communicating the subject

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:20.060 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:25.190 align:middle line:10%
>> He had such a profound
effect on our senior teachers,

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:29.400 align:middle line:10%
who since the early
'70s trained with him.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.580 align:middle line:10%
He was not able to come
to South Africa because

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.280 align:middle line:10%
of political reasons,
but they went

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.780 align:middle line:10%
to Mauritius to train with him,
to Swaziland to train with him.

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And they had such a close
relationship with him.

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> To watch him teach
from country to country,

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:47.000 align:middle line:84%
which I was lucky enough
to do several times.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.480 align:middle line:84%
He would even change his
very mode or perspective

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to reach the audience
that was in front of him.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Not so much to draw them to
him, because he was belief,

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I honestly think, was
not in his own abilities,

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:02.210 align:middle line:84%
but in his belief
in the subject which

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:04.400 align:middle line:90%
he had given his life over to.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if you don't
know about Iyengar Yoga,

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.670 align:middle line:84%
you're doing Iyengar Yoga,
because it has spread around

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:12.205 align:middle line:90%
the world everywhere.

00:59:12.205 --> 00:59:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And no matter where
I go and who teaches,

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I find that the Iyengar method
is so rooted in tradition

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and discipline that instructions
remain constant and simple

00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.430 align:middle line:90%
and precise.

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:26.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I remember a time we're
in a sort tiny little--

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:29.780 align:middle line:10%
a small town in North Carolina,
in the deep south in America.

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to know
a Iyengar studio--

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.920 align:middle line:84%
a studio with one of the
teachers in Iyengar's class,

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.900 align:middle line:90%
and I went to it.

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.495 align:middle line:90%
And it was the same thing.

00:59:37.495 --> 00:59:39.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, same thing you
do in Pune, same thing you

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.550 align:middle line:84%
do in London, same thing
you do in Cambridge.

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It's everywhere.

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.960 align:middle line:10%
It's like, in England when
I go, it's in America.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I know studios that
I can just walk in,

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.260 align:middle line:90%
and it feels like home.

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> We are worldwide.

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:56.270 align:middle line:84%
We are renowned for the healing
capacity of Iyengar Yoga.

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So even in Germany,
where I am from,

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:02.300 align:middle line:84%
there are two big
university hospitals.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.160 align:middle line:84%
They just do research
work on yoga.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:19.170 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Six years ago, I was able to
open my own Iyengar Yoga center

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
in San Marcos, the
community where I live.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I opened the Iyengar Yoga
institutes of Birmingham

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:32.730 align:middle line:10%
in 2002.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:38.990 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:44.990 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1988, the Japanese Iyengar
Yoga Association was found with

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:46.940 align:middle line:10%
only seven members.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are about 120
Iyengar Yoga teachers in Japan.

01:00:51.850 --> 01:01:02.400 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:17.620 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Our studio was
dedicated to Iyengar Yoga.

01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:26.430 align:middle line:10%
And we started building up
quite a few student base.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And that little
studio became a hub

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:30.765 align:middle line:90%
of Iyengar Yoga [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:30.765 --> 01:01:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The yoga community in
Glasgow is growing all the time.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So we now have
some new teachers.

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
We now have a far
bigger pool of people

01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:41.852 align:middle line:84%
who are studding
all the time there.

01:01:41.852 --> 01:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that Guruji
intended to unite the world

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
in that way when she started
practicing as a young boy.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.660 align:middle line:10%
>> But when you
practice Iyengar Yoga,

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.250 align:middle line:10%
you never feel lonely or lost,
because you know that wherever

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.350 align:middle line:10%
you go, there is a Iyengar
Yoga teacher and other

01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:57.820 align:middle line:10%
practitioners.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And you meet people who
share the same values

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:90%
and have the same views.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel Guruji's art has
brought people together,

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.790 align:middle line:84%
not only in Birmingham,
but all over the world.

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:15.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And sometimes Guruji calls
us my children in the field

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.320 align:middle line:10%
of yoga.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.510 align:middle line:10%
So I know I have beautiful
sisters and brothers

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:24.190 align:middle line:10%
all around the world.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:29.666 align:middle line:10%
>> Everyone is like a branch and
flower and leaves from all over

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:37.330 align:middle line:10%
the world to spread Iyengar Yoga
knowledge all over the world.

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And another joy has been
to be part of that community,

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to be part of these
like minded people--

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
what we share in common.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And the complete sense
of devastation and loss

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
that community felt when Mr.
Iyengar died, when Guruji died,

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:00.130 align:middle line:90%
was just so overwhelming.

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It was almost curious that
somebody who lived so far away

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
could have that
influence in people.

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And everyone felt
entirely bereft.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.380 align:middle line:10%
>> He has helped
millions of people,

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:18.020 align:middle line:10%
and people who have
different lives.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.900 align:middle line:10%
>> He was open to expand
and pass his knowledge

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.740 align:middle line:10%
to everybody.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.805 align:middle line:10%
He didn't make difference
at all who you were.

01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> He love everybody.

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
He never had any
discrimination about anybody's

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
social background,
economic background.

01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:39.410 align:middle line:10%
>> And then he said, I
welcome every student of yoga.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
every person needs

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.390 align:middle line:90%
to make a beginning somewhere.

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:49.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Guruji's yoga has
taught me how to be--

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:53.220 align:middle line:10%
how to sit, how just
stand, how to walk,

01:03:53.220 --> 01:04:00.740 align:middle line:10%
how to run, how to eat, how
to sleep, how to observe,

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.330 align:middle line:10%
and how to absorb.

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:06.020 align:middle line:10%
>> It satisfies me creatively--
the joy of exploring,

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.240 align:middle line:10%
and learning new things,
and trying new things.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And the reason I can
continue to be a photographer,

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:14.980 align:middle line:10%
carry those heavy backpacks,
and movement is because I do

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:15.910 align:middle line:10%
Iyengar Yoga.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:27.530 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.940 align:middle line:10%
>> It was due to Guruji
that I was able to walk.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It was to due to
Guruji that I was

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
able to put off having back
surgery for over 40 years.

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:42.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm a different person.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.180 align:middle line:10%
I got new legs.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.040 align:middle line:10%
I got new spine.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:51.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Through doing this forward
bending, headband wrapping,

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.490 align:middle line:10%
slow Iyengar Yoga
rehabilitation process,

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:58.250 align:middle line:10%
we've managed to bring these
headaches under control within

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:03.420 align:middle line:10%
the first two months of
my two brain surgeries.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, Iyengar Yoga has
become indispensable for me.

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:12.920 align:middle line:10%
With my medical limitations, I
have learned to live happily.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a type of yoga
that I would be able to do

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
into my golden years.

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And since my golden years
are right around the corner,

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and here I am, still
doing Iyengar Yoga.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>> At the ripe age of 60,
I am doing Sirsasana and--

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.530 align:middle line:10%
I don't know-- six minutes
every day for a long time.

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:36.290 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:41.300 align:middle line:10%
>> And if I stick to what he has
taught and what he's developed,

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.980 align:middle line:10%
I will find my way.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So whatever I am today,
or whatever I am doing,

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
it's only and only
because of Guruji.

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So about his legacy, is what
one is that is his legacy.

01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
What he has made us,
that is his legacy.

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we
are carrying with us.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said, as long
as mine students can give

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
their students a taste of the
sensitivity alertness that

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you all--

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
as long as that's there,
this will live on.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.345 align:middle line:10%
>> 29 years later,
I'm grandmother,

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:17.750 align:middle line:10%
and I'm still practicing and
learning from the teachings

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.850 align:middle line:10%
of this extraordinary man.

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
His legacy lives on through
the generations of my family.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:37.490 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:41.560 align:middle line:10%
>> So he has left behind us a
boon for humanity with all his

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:46.850 align:middle line:10%
research and application in the
field of yoga to heal the human

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:48.220 align:middle line:10%
body and mind.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.140 align:middle line:10%
So I think it is up
to us to use it now.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We also have the
responsibility to keep

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
on spreading his teaching
and the values he wanted

01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
to promote.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And to help other people to
understand how important it is

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
to make the proper asanas with
guidance, with understanding,

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
with alignment.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.990 align:middle line:10%
>> His fantastic success lies
now for us as a foundation

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:17.040 align:middle line:10%
to build upon further.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:21.240 align:middle line:10%
>> So we must pass on to
the next generation for them

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.790 align:middle line:10%
to continue Guruji's legacy.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why we
continue to teach.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.770 align:middle line:90%
That's why we want to give.

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
We want to help people the way
he helped, the way he taught.

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Because this is what
we're supposed to do--

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to continue, to let go, show.

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Plant the seed so
that everybody can

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.960 align:middle line:90%
see that Guruji is not dead.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Guruji is only, as he said--

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going to
change my clothes.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I am not going anywhere.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going to
change my clothes.

01:07:54.910 --> 01:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Every aspect of my
life is linked with him--

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
whether I sleep, whether I
eat, whether I practice yoga.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere, Guruji is with me.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> So I am lucky.

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I was very lucky to have
been in and around him--

01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
not just in the institute during
the classes or during practice,

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
but also at home, because each--
now that he's no longer there,

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:32.410 align:middle line:84%
each memory that I have of him
is a valuable thing for me now.

01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Guruji is never far from us.

01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:35.779 align:middle line:84%
He's certainly
never far from me.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:38.210 align:middle line:90%
He's always there on my mat.

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:42.649 align:middle line:84%
And those lessons and
the tools that he gave

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:43.850 align:middle line:90%
continue to evolve.

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And for that, I'm
eternally grateful.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.200 align:middle line:10%
>> And he really tuned in and
made us understand that his

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.660 align:middle line:10%
method wasn't his method--

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.300 align:middle line:10%
that he was teaching
yoga, and that we

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.430 align:middle line:10%
were calling it Iyengar Yoga.

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And that it was something
greater than him.

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And then what he taught
us is something so much

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.029 align:middle line:90%
greater than all of us.

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:12.529 align:middle line:10%
>> We can practice,
and go on in our life,

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:19.800 align:middle line:10%
and follow the path so that
maybe one day his sentence,

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.520 align:middle line:10%
may my end be your
beginning, may be true.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I always thought of
Guruji's teaching as rainfall.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a downpour, and
whoever was lucky enough

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to be in that field,
received that.

01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So he never chose,
or he never selected,

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that he would teach this
person and not that person.

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So whoever was there
just received it.

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.270 align:middle line:90%
So it is the--

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.250 align:middle line:84%
the onus is upon
each one of us who

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:53.060 align:middle line:84%
was received that
rainfall to keep it alive

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and to pass it on
as [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:59.670 align:middle line:10%
>> If you are practicing
yoga, do not get carried away,

01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:00.948 align:middle line:10%
but continue.

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:03.320 align:middle line:10%
The light will come on its own.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.950 align:middle line:10%
The fruit will fall to the
ground when it is ripe.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.290 align:middle line:10%
Is it not?

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.160 align:middle line:10%
We are practicing yoga.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.120 align:middle line:10%
So as we practicing,
the fruit has

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.910 align:middle line:10%
to come when the body and the
mind is right for it to fall.

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:19.410 align:middle line:10%
Then that is known
as self-realisation.

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:21.090 align:middle line:10%
Because you have to
tend to the tree.

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:23.340 align:middle line:10%
You have to look up to the
tree for the fruit to come.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.223 align:middle line:10%
So also, you have to look after
the body and the mind, which

01:10:26.223 --> 01:10:29.580 align:middle line:10%
are the tree of the soul, which
are the branches of the soul.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.305 align:middle line:10%
So they have to
be looked after so

01:10:31.305 --> 01:10:33.480 align:middle line:10%
that the essence
may come out and you

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.180 align:middle line:10%
drink the essence of the soul.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:11:06.930 align:middle line:90%


01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:10.660 align:middle line:10%
