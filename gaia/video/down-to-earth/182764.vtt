I remember coming
home one day, and we

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:10%
were going to go into one of the
kids' tepees with his parents,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.260 align:middle line:10%

take your shoes off.

say they would make you sick.

is literally putting your bare

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:10%
feet on the ground.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, you're
in contact with the Earth,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and Mother Earth is
endowed with electrons.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And these electrons
are literally

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:90%
absorbed through your feet.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:10%
It's like taking
handfuls of antioxidants,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:10%
but you're getting
it through the feet.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Grounding means connecting
to the Earth to support

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
the specific function of
the organs of your body.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:10%
It supports the body as a
whole, but it specifically

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:10%
supports organ systems
down to the tissues,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.090 align:middle line:10%
and the cellular function
of the entire body.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1960, we invented
synthetic materials.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we did
was we put rubber sole,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:90%
synthetic soles on the shoes.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:10%
We started wearing sneakers.

>> So it's the most common sense
thing that we are organisms

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that live and grow and depend
entirely on the Earth while

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:90%
we're alive.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have completely
isolated ourself from it.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
We're so disconnected that it
becomes this weird thing if we

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:90%
actually slip our shoes off.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I first learned the need
to ground cable signals

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:84%
as we were developing
the industry.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
When you run a wire
into the house,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.850 align:middle line:84%
before you can go
into the house,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:90%
you have to ground the cable.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have miles of wire
hanging up there in the air,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
if there's lightning in the air,
it's going to hit the cable.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And so what you want
to do is create a path

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:10%
to ground for the
lightning so that it

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:10%
doesn't enter the house, or blow
up the TV, or create a fire.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
One day, I was
sitting at a computer,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.845 align:middle line:90%
and the computer kept crashing.

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I know it was
static electricity,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
so I put a piece of tape
across my desk and grounded it.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized in that
process that the outlet wasn't

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
grounded, so I fixed it
so that I could get rid

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:90%
of the static electricity.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
too much about it.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I walked outdoors
and I sat on a bench.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
This tour bus pulled up, and
it looked like they had just

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
been to one of
these outlet malls,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and white Nike
shoes were on sale.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It just dawned on me, I
asked the question, I said,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if it's possible
that humans are--

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
we're no longer
naturally grounded.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if these shoes
could be interfering with us.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So that night, went
to the hardware store

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and I bought a roll
of metal duct tape,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and I just taped
it across the bed,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I threw a wire out the window.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had a ground rod outside,
I connected it to the ground

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
on one side, and connected
it to the metal duct tape

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
that I had laid on the bed.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So when I laid down
on the duct tape,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I was like, grounded, because
it was connected to the Earth.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.407 align:middle line:84%
I woke up the next morning,
and I thought, holy cow,

00:03:51.407 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:90%
there's something going on here.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Because normally, for me to go
to sleep, I had to take Advil.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to find
out what I could.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
The internet was
hardly anything.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:90%
This was back in '99.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Went down to the
University of Arizona

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
into one of their
medical libraries,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
and there was nothing.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I even tried
to find the cause

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of chronic pain, the cause
of MS, which was unknown,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:90%
the cause of arthritis, unknown.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well,
I'll go out to LA.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to UCLA and ask them.

They pretty much
laughed me off campus.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
They said, you expect us to
believe that somebody is going

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.103 align:middle line:84%
to put a nail in the ground, tie
a wire around somebody's toe,

00:04:33.103 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
make him sleep better?

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:90%
They said, get out of here.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:90%
You're nuts.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:10%
So I ended up having to
put together my own study.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:10%
And we grounded 60 people,
and the reports that came in

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:10%
were unbelievable.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
TMJ disappeared, PMS
disappeared, inflammation,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
reduced pain,
everybody slept better.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Found an anesthesiologist
in San Diego.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:10%
He says, I don't think there's
anything to what you're doing.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
This has got to be
an anomaly here.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:90%
But I'll entertain you, he says.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:10%
I will prove that you're wrong.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:90%
And we did the study.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the first study that I
did that was a legitimate study

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:90%
where we had quantifiable data.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Then we decided, well, we're
going to do a big study now.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up attracting
scientists, physicists.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%

study, everybody

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%

First thing I did, being
a physician myself,

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.785 align:middle line:84%
was take her to
the pediatrician.

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:52.717 align:middle line:84%
And remember distinctly leaving
that pediatrician's office

00:05:52.717 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
with a knot in my stomach,
because the first thing

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.008 align:middle line:90%
they told me is, it's a baby.

00:05:56.008 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Let them cry.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the only time I
noticed that she wasn't in pain

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and the only time I could soothe
her was when I was outside

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and I was barefoot and
I had her in my arms.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And every time we were
outside, she relaxed.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I noticed if I
did use a stroller

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
or if she was in a
car, she was still

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:90%
in pain and uncomfortable.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:90%
This is not placebo effect.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.393 align:middle line:84%
Like, she had no idea if I
was wearing shoes or not.

00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:90%

this child can only
take a nap and feel

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
comfort is if she was on
my skin, held skin to skin,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and I was barefoot.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%

if I stepped in the house

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and took both my feet off the
ground, she would wake back up

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and the pain response
would come back.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know it was called,
and I didn't at that time

that I ground my energy.

I didn't know what she
meant by ground yourself,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.505 align:middle line:84%

was go home and look it up

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
on the internet, and through
doing a search about grounding,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I found Clint Ober's work
and the book about earthing,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%

real thing and a real healing

it with many of their athletes

and with surprising results.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think surprising best
summarizes my response to it,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't
seem to make sense.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I think I became
a believer once I

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:90%

What you have is
chronic inflammation.

inflammation in the body,

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and it comes out in illnesses.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
We go to a doctor with all these
complaints, but a lot of it

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.820 align:middle line:84%
is silent inflammation,
including my specialty,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:90%
heart disease.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease is an
inflammatory process.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:10%
So how do we reduce
inflammation?

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Inflammation is
produced by neutrophils,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:10%
which is a white blood cell.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:90%
You have an injury.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:90%
You have a damaged cell.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And so these white
blood cells come over

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and they encapsulate
the damage cell,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and they release reactive oxygen
species, which rip electrons

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
from the damaged cell, and
that destroys the damaged cell.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
If there's not
enough free electrons

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.168 align:middle line:84%
there to reduce the
remaining radicals,

00:10:06.168 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:84%
they're going to steal an
electron from a healthy cell,

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:90%
and in the process, damage it.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Then the message goes
out to the immune system,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and another neutrophil
does the same thing,

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
eliminates that cell,
and then you end up

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:90%
with a chain reaction.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> ATP is short for
adenosine triphosphate.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy
currency of the cell.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.493 align:middle line:90%
We're bioelectrical beings.

00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:10%
That's the currency
of our bodies.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:27.743 align:middle line:10%
That's how it works.

00:10:27.743 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:10%
That's how we run our
biological systems is

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:10%
by generating this electrical
energy that's transferred.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we connect to the Earth
through a conductive surface

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle line:84%
in some way, there's a
transfer of electrons that's

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:90%
slowly going to our body.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
In situations where we are
insulating ourselves from this,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:84%
a surplus of electrons
enter a body,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
the absolute opposite.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.083 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having low
levels of inflammation

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
in a thin blood, we'll
have thick blood that's

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.910 align:middle line:84%
more likely to clot and
our levels of inflammation

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
tend to increase.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You could take anybody
who has chronic pain,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
doesn't who they are,
doesn't matter what's wrong,

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.802 align:middle line:84%
and ground them, and you're
going to have a significant

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:90%
reduction in pain.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
stop the oxidation

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:90%
or the inflamed portion.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%
That stops almost immediately.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Then the body can heal
and return to normal.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:10%
And healing generally
is improved by 60%, 70%.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
If inflammation is the cause
of all these health disorders,

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:84%
then I know that not grounding
is the cause of inflammation.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if the body is grounded,
you can't have inflammation.

>> Can we measure the
effects reproducibility?

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:90%
The answer to that is yes.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:90%
We now have 20 studies.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> There's like, yeah,
20, 21 published studies

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%

on earthing and grounding.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is peer-reviewed stuff.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
In simple terms, what earthing
thing does is literally,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
it squenches the
fires of inflammation.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:10%
And if inflammation is the
source of all root illnesses,

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:10%
including Alzheimer's disease,
cancer, heart disease,

go immediately into a

fenced in and are
paved with asphalt.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they have after school

grounding is that you

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
don't need a doctor
to tell you to do it.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
You do not need a physician
to recommend it to you.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:90%
You can try this any time.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It is your birthright because
you live on the Earth.

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth or sit on
the Earth, put your feet

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and your hands on the Earth,
and you will instantly

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
the most common

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%

I got my life back.
