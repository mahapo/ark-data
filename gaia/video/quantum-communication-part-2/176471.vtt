00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:02.982 align:middle line:90%

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Subtle energies all
go faster than light.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, when you--

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask you to visualize
a reaction equation

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
as if you've got a
blackboard in front of you.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'll write mass with arrows
back and forth to energy.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
That is basically what we've
done for the last 400 years

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:90%
in orthodox science.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And the connection link is
Einstein's E equals MC squared.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we want to
expand traditional science

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:90%
to include human consciousness.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Our experiments show that works
now in this world we live in.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But we don't all agree
what consciousness is.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's not ask what
consciousness is, let's ask

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:90%
what consciousness does.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Astronaut Edgar Mitchell
found that consciousness has

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
a better quality
signal in space.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Scientific studies seem to
confirm that consciousness

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
travels instantaneously
over any distance,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
at least it appears that way
over the known Earth-to-Sun

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
to Sun maximum distances
measured thus far.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Dr. William Tiller calculates
that due to the fact that

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
consciousness cannot be
blocked by any barrier--

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
including lead and
mountains of rock,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
which are capable of blocking
the highest frequency gamma

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:90%
rays--

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
consciousness must be of a
higher frequency than the gamma

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
ray spectrum to allow it to
penetrate these barriers.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:10%
Also, in order for
consciousness to appear

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:10%
to travel instantaneously
over Earth-to-Sun distances,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:10%
it would have to at
least travel at the speed

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:10%
of light squared, which is
34.7 billion miles per second.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the theory is that
they all travel faster than

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the velocity of
light, and that's why

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:90%
they're non-observable.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And the magnetoelectric energy--

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
its top velocity from my
theory is that it's c squared.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
So it goes from c to c squared.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Tiller's new model
of consciousness has

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensions.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:10%
It starts with
the second chakra,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:10%
being capable of
sending consciousness

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:10%
as coherent information
at a frequency

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:10%
beyond the gamma ray spectrum
in the magnetoelectric spectrum

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:10%
with wavelengths so
tiny and frequencies

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:10%
so high they could penetrate
any subatomic barrier.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
This level of consciousness
can send coherent information

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light
squared, or 34.7 billion miles

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Since the Sun is approximately
93 million miles from Earth,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
consciousness would appear
to travel from the Sun

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth in a tiny
fraction of a second--

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:90%
1/373.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Whereas if you go
to the next level,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the emotional domain level, it's
sort of c squared to c cubed.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Tiller's second
level of consciousness,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
emanating from the heart center,
allows coherent information

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
to travel at the
speed of light cubed,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
or 64.64 quadrillion
miles per second.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a level of
cosmic proportions.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:10%
As the speed of light travels
5.87 trillion miles per year

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:10%
and the Pleiades star system
is 440 light years away

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:10%
from Earth, or 2.58
quadrillion miles,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:10%
it would take ordinary light
or radio messages 440 years

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:10%
to get there.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness at this
level of realization,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
traveling 64.64 quadrillion
miles per second,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
could travel to 2.58 quadrillion
miles to the Pleiades star

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.005 align:middle line:90%
system in 1/4 of a second.

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>> If you go to the mind
level, it's c cubed to c

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:90%
to the fourth.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Tiller's next
level of consciousness,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
emanating from the
crown chakra and higher,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
allows coherent information to
travel to the Andromeda Galaxy,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
2.5 million light
years from Earth,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:90%
in a fraction of a second.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
At this level of
realization, we attain

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:90%
ultra cosmic consciousness.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
This means at these higher
levels of realization

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
we can create a dialogue
with other galaxies.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The answer to how we
can attain coherency,

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
total perfect harmonic
consciousness,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
in each of our energy centers
is inside of our biology.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Very interesting fact in
biology is that no two human

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:90%
beings are the same.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that from a
biological expression in regard

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:90%
to a simple observation.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:10%
If you take cells or
organs out of your body

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and put them into
anybody else's body,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:10%
those cells and organs will
be rejected by that individual

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:10%
because their immune system
will recognize it is not self.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:10%
So basically, it says
each one of us has a self.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:10%
And what was very
interesting in understanding

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:10%
the nature of the
cell's nervous system,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:10%
the relationship of the
membrane to the cell,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:10%
was that on the
surface of our cells

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:10%
are groups of
antennas or receptors.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
A group of them specifically
studied by medicine

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:84%
are referred to
as self-receptors.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's a
very profound title

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
for these particular receptors--
self-receptors, receivers

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:90%
of self.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So why this is relevant
is that these receptors

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that receive an identity are
on the outer surface of a cell.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:84%
The relevance to that is that
whatever the self-signal is,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:84%
it is out in the environment and
picked up by these receptors.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Significance to my
perception in this

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:84%
is that our identities are
not within our biology.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Our identities are
part of a field

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and that our biology
downloads this information

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:90%
from the field.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So the significance
is that when we

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
talk about our
personal identity,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about that
identity isolated and localized

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:84%
with our physical
body, but we could also

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
talk about the same
information or identity that

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:90%
is present in the field.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Cleve Backster
did some wonderful experiments

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
where he took cells
from an individual,

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:84%
put them in a culture dish,
and separated those cells

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
from that individual by a
distance of 40 or more miles.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And what he had
was an experiment

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
where he put electrical devices
to read the electrical activity

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:90%
of the cells in a culture dish.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, he was reading
the electrical activity--

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%
for example, the EEG activity--

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
of the donor of those cells
who was 40 miles away.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:84%
What he recognized is
that if the individual had

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:84%
an emotional experience
at that moment,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:84%
the individual cells
would also have

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
an identical kind of activity
occur instantaneously

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, even though
they were 40 miles away.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
The relevance about
this is really

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
very supportive of the fact
that the identity is not

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:90%
localized within the body.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
The identity is
part of the field

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and spread all over the
surface of the planet.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Significance is
this-- is that when

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
two people have two physical
bodies and they can interact,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
but they'll also have two
environmental identifications,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning some kind of
energy in the field that

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:90%
is unique to them.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Since the field is all
entangled and integrated

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.954 align:middle line:84%
with each other
all over the world,

00:08:11.954 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that means people
are never really

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
separated from each other by
physical distances in regard

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
to their personal identity,
even though their bodies may

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:90%
be separated.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the nature
of people communicating

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:84%
with each other is to recognize
that individual identities

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:84%
as vibrational
frequencies in a field

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
can interact with
each other, especially

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
if there is something
called harmonic resonance,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:84%
meaning the two frequencies
share wavelengths together

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
so that when they come
together, they vibrate together.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
people can actually

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
feel other people that are
closely related to them,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
because they can
pick up the vibration

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.195 align:middle line:84%
of the other individual
in that there

00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
is a complementarity
between them

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and the person they're
communicating with.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So the significance is
we have an opportunity

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to interact on a
nonphysical plane

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:84%
through the identity
that is in the field.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is very important
because it is not

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
localized to space or time,
that people can communicate over

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
vast differences on
this planet at exactly

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:90%
the same moment of time.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> In our current science,
there are four basic forces--

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetism,
gravity, and the strong

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and the weak forces which
occur in the nucleus and they

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
hold the nucleus
and atoms together.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:10%
And in our physics
research, we've

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:10%
been learning how to unify
these forces to some extent,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:10%
and there's now a
standard model that

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:10%
has a way of putting together
three of them to some extent.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But in current physics,
there's an attitude

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
that this pretty much
explains everything you

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:90%
need to know in the universe.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that idea
is based on the fact

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that our knowledge of physics
comes from high-energy particle

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:10%
Scientists take
elementary particles

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:10%
and bang them
together at high speed

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:10%
and they watch what
happens, and they say, well,

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:10%
that's the universe.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:10%
That's what we have to explain.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:10%
And our current model
does a pretty good job

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:10%
of explaining that.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:10%
What they've overlooked are
a lot of other phenomena

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:10%
that they don't tend to study.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you take the
example I mentioned of ESP

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
are psychic connections,
that's one area which

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
says that there are forces
and ways of interacting

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that can't be explained
by that four-force model.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> When scientists measure the
capabilities of subtle energy

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:84%
or the psychic force, it
outperforms all of the other

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Today, we store and
transmit information

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:84%
through radio and
television waves.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
This kind of information is
likened to human consciousness,

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't possess
all of its qualities.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is still
unique and more powerful.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Radio waves and
microwaves are used

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to broadcast voices
and television

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%
pictures at the speed of light.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The problem is these
electromagnetic signals

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
get weaker over distance
and can distort or collapse

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:84%
when trying to move through
solid barriers such as walls,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:90%
metal, or even mountains.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
After conducting
hundreds of tests,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
scientists have discovered
that subtle energy,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
the psychic force, is capable
of penetrating any dimension,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:84%
barrier, or distance with
no loss in signal quality,

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
even through vast
distances in space.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The Princeton PEAR Lab
experiments have also shown

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:84%
that people's minds have
the ability to affect things

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
They take a device called a
random event generator, which

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
makes a sequence of random
ones and zeros or yeses in nos

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:90%
based on a quantum circuit.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
What they have shown
is that the mind

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
can affect how that
object behaves,

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:84%
what the stream of ones
and zeros looks like,

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and it does not
depend how far away

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:84%
you are from the person
influencing the experiment.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Even thousands of
miles away, a person

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
is able to affect the
results just as well.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So we have an ability to exert
a force on distant objects that

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
does not fall into any of
the known category of forces.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This new force goes through
barriers that would normally

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:90%
stop the known forces.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
It even acts backwards
in time in certain types

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:90%
of experiments.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
This new force-- the Russians
have called torsion--

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
is known by a variety
of different names.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It may be the same thing
as what the Chinese call

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
qi, the essence of
Chinese medicine.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It appears to affect
space and time.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, it affects
all the other forces,

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and it really calls for a
new reexamination of physics.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Bill Tiller has called
this raising the gauge.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller has
conducted hundreds of tests

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:84%
proving that human consciousness
or intention can affect the pH

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
value of water over any
distance and through any barrier

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
or dimension.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's start with the unstated
assumption that's been existing

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:10%
in science for 400 years
since the days of Descartes,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:10%
and that is that no human
qualities of consciousness,

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:10%
intention, emotion, mind,
or spirit can significantly

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:10%
influence a well-designed target
experiment in physical reality.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:10%
And so in '97, I set out to
seriously test that assumption,

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:10%
having received some important
funding from a private source.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea was to design
for target experiments,

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
set them up with all
kinds of controls

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
you would have in any normal
orthodox science experiment,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and to then introduce
consciousness

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:90%
into the experimental medium.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:90%
The four experiments were to--

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
the intention was to
increase the pH of water

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:84%
by one full pH unit with
no chemical additions,

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and the water was in
equilibrium with air.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
The second target
experiment was to decrease

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
the pH of the same water by
one pH unit with no chemical

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:84%
additions and again an
equilibrium with air.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And in both cases, the accuracy
of the measurement instruments

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
were plus or minus
0.01 pH units.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So we were asking
for a signature,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:84%
which was the order of
100 times the noise.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>> First, Dr. Tiller did
experiments applying direct

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:84%
human intention to water
and got positive results.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
He then was able to
capture a human intention

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
as if in a computer hard drive
and a bioelectrical intention

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:84%
host device with
the instructions

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to raise or lower the
pH value in water.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of distance,
repeatedly, the intention

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:84%
was able to affect
the pH value in water.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Within three weeks, the
pH had gone up one pH unit.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And then three months later,
the Milan folks weighed in.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.097 align:middle line:10%
And we said the
same thing to them--

00:16:29.097 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:10%
to be part of the
experiment, we wanted them

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:10%
to just measure background.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And we used it as a control
site for, again, the three

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:84%
active sites, and
within one week,

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:90%
the pH went up 1.7 pH units.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
When we looked at
our data, we found

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
in one of the control
sites in Missouri--

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
it was underground--
and there the pH

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:90%
had gone up 1.7 pH units.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So what we gathered--
not only was there

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
information entanglement
over as much as 6,000 miles,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
but that if the measurement
site was below ground,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:84%
the pH went up more
than 1 pH unit.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
If it was three
stories up in the air,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
as it was in Bethesda
in Baltimore,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:90%
it only went up 0.8 pH units.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
But if it was at
ground level, it

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
went up 1 pH unit, which
was the level where we first

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
made the imprint intention
in their devices.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Another amazing quality the
psychic force exhibits is no

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
distortion between
sender and receiver.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
That means the lines of
communication remain private.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Gary Schwartz, and
I'm currently a professor

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:10%
of psychology medicine,
neurology, psychiatry,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:10%
and surgery at the University
of Arizona where I direct

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:10%
a laboratory for advances
in consciousness and health.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:10%
And I direct a team
of people doing

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:10%
research that essentially
integrates body, mind,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.305 align:middle line:10%
and spirit.

00:17:57.305 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:10%
We've been doing
a lot of research

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:10%
in the area of energy
healing and consciousness

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:10%
that involves energy and
also extends beyond us--

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:10%
so when one person's
consciousness and energy

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:10%
can affect the physiology,
biochemistry, cellular

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:10%
function, and conscious
experience of someone else,

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:10%
either locally, in a
close proximity, or even

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:10%
hundreds or thousands
of miles away.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's summarized
in my new book,

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
"The Energy Healing
Experiments."

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've done many
kinds of experiments

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
to look at both local and
non-local or distal effects

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:90%
of intention on healing.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
One area of research involved
was called biophoton imaging

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
where we literally, using
a supercooled camera--

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
it's cooled anywhere
from minus 70

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:90%
to minus 100 degrees centigrade.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
These cameras were originally
designed to look out into deep

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:59.071 align:middle line:84%
space to photograph galaxies we
cannot see with the naked eye.

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, we began to
wonder if we could

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.020 align:middle line:84%
use these cameras to actually
image living systems.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So instead of looking
out into space,

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at biology.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.894 align:middle line:84%
And we began
working with plants.

00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:10%
And one of the many reasons
for working with plants,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:10%
besides they're fundamental to
life and they relate to light

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.105 align:middle line:10%
and we are very
much part of the--

00:19:19.105 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:10%
and connect with
the plant community,

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:10%
but plants are also
very easy to work

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:10%
with because they can sit in the
dark for long periods of time,

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:10%
they sit still, and
so therefore you

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:10%
can get very good images of
the light that the plants emit.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is that not
only can we measure the light

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out of the plants,
which you cannot see with

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
the naked eye, but we can
measure auras that are actually

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the plant.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the light that's
going on around the plants.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we can actually see how
the plants interact with light.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you have
two geranium leaves, one

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
next to the other, and
you take a long exposure,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see the
extension of the light.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.107 align:middle line:84%
And it's like lightning
grabbing one another

00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:90%
and caressing one another.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
You actually see the light beams
connecting the two, which again

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:90%
has never before been seen.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Now you can take healers,
and healers can, for example,

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
send healing
intentions to a leaf,

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:84%
or they can speak
specifically as to say,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
can you enable the
leaf to glow more?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And we could actually
show that people

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
who are trained as
healers can actually,

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
without touching the leaves,
with their intention,

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
send an intention for the leaves
to spontaneously glow more,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and then we can place
them in this completely

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
dark chamber where these
images are obtained,

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and low and behold discover
that the leaves are glowing.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, you take that
one step further,

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and you can say, well, what
about people from a distance?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Could people do
this 10 miles away?

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Could they do this 100 miles
away or even 1,000 miles away?

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And with Lynn McTaggart, who
wrote the book "The Field"

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and has written a new
book called "The Intention

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Experiment," we've been doing
long-distance experiments

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
where, for example, a group
of 400 people in England

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:84%
will, together as a
group, for 10 minutes

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:84%
send an intention
to a leaf in Tucson

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:90%
in my laboratory to glow.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.905 align:middle line:90%
And we'll have two leaves.

00:21:25.905 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:90%
We'll call them leaf a and b.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Each leaf has been injured.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It's been-- little holes
have been placed in it,

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
16 of them in a
four-by-four grid,

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
because when you injure a
leaf, it actually glows more,

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.020 align:middle line:84%
because when there's
injury, there's actually--

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
the healing response
involves energy.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And then what we do is we
have two video cameras, cam

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:84%
recorders, picking up the
images of each of the leaves

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and then sending by the
internet to England.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone in the
audience flips a coin

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and it comes out
randomly heads or tails.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And let's say they pick leaf b.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:84%
At this point, the image from
Tucson sent to London of leaf b

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:90%
is now on the screen.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And now 400 people
can simultaneously

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.830 align:middle line:84%
send glowing intentions
to the leaf that they see.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, my research
assistant in Tuscon, Mark,

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
he's blind to which
leaf has been selected.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:10%
After the 10 minutes, Mark is
then asked to take the leaves

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:10%
and put them into the
biophoton imaging system

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:10%
so we can collect these
long-exposure images

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:10%
of the leaves, and
then they're blindly

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.950 align:middle line:10%
scored before we break the
code to find out what happens.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And much to my absolute
amazement, sure enough,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
if leaf b was selected
from a distant group

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and they could
actually see the leaf,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
they're able to affect
the glowing of that leaf

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:90%
compared to a matched control.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> German physicist Fritz-Albert
Popp proved the existence

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
of biophotons, that all living
organisms, including humans,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
had auras that transmitted and
received intelligent signals.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
He also found that
plants communicate

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.810 align:middle line:84%
at a distance with one
another by their transmissions

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:90%
and receptions of biophotons.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
This digital photograph
of a giant palm tree

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
shows something
extraordinary that appeared

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.246 align:middle line:90%
invisible to the naked eye--

00:23:38.246 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
a 2 to 3-foot wide
orb of plasma white.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:10%
It even has a green
plasma membrane,

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:10%
kind of like a giant cell.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Are plants in communication
with invisible beings of light?

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:10%
Could we be in communication
through Einstein's action

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:10%
at a distance with
our future soul

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:10%
matches as friends, loves,
husbands, wives, teachers,

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:10%
business partners,
and spiritual mentors

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:10%
before we meet in person
for the first time?

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Could this communication
be happening

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
based on our current
thoughts, feelings, patterns,

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and our personal
energy signature?

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Creating a dialogue with your
soulmate before you meet them

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:10%
is very important because a
lot of us may feel that maybe

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:10%
our soulmate isn't
really out there,

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:10%
and so in the back of your
mind, you hope for it,

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:10%
but it's not active in
your day-to-day life.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
put those messages out,

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.295 align:middle line:84%
that that is what
you're looking for.

00:25:02.295 --> 00:25:04.170 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
settle for anything else.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:84%
When you clear your
space, and you're

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
totally open to
receive your soulmate,

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and when you do your soul
work on a daily basis,

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and you put the
feeling tone of finding

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:90%
your soulmate in that space--

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:84%
all of those things are
essential to communicating

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
with your soulmate before
you actually meet them.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe that
your soulmate can hear you

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't believe
it and you're just saying,

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to put
out this message--

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:84%
if you're actually there
or not, I don't know,

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.999 align:middle line:84%
but I'll just say that I'm
ready and you'll hear me--

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work that way.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to truly believe that
they can hear you and send

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
a clear message to them in order
for the line of communication

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to meet them instantly
because that is not only

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
a leap of faith, but it
also creates a clear signal

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing, no
doubts, no resistance,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
are interfering
with that signal.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
If you have a doubt,
an interference,

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
through that not
being sure, then it

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:90%
won't be an instant message.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:84%
It will come to a stop
sign at some point.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important to
have faith and true belief

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:84%
that your soulmate can hear
you when you're sending out

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:84%
those feeling tones and
those messages of I'm

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
ready for you and mirroring
that in your actions

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:90%
in your day-to-day basis.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Bruce Lipton has
made a remarkable discovery

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
by observing how biological
cells can be in communication

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.540 align:middle line:90%
with one another at a distance.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an interesting
understanding in biology about

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.230 align:middle line:84%
how one can separate proteins
in a mixture which contains

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:90%
thousands of different proteins.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And basically how
it works is you

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:84%
take a drop of this
mixture of thousands

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:84%
of different proteins, you
put it on a surface of a gel,

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and what you do is run
on electric current

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:90%
through this gel surface.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
because each protein has

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:84%
its own unique vibrational
frequency and mass to it,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:84%
each protein
responds to the field

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
with its own unique
characteristics.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So as a result of putting
the proteins in a field,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
it causes the proteins
to move in that field.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Some proteins move faster
than other proteins,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:84%
so the net result is that
the proteins actually

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
begin to sort themselves
out on a Petri dish.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, if you
continue doing this,

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
you can identify
individual clusters

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
of proteins that share common
characteristics because they

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.960 align:middle line:84%
will move at the same
rate of speed on this gel.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
We apply this to an
understanding of humans

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:90%
as protein mechanisms.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us has our own
unique identifying frequency

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us on the
surface of the Earth

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:90%
is like a protein on the gel.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, the
field forces around us,

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.800 align:middle line:84%
the invisible forces, influence
our movement on the surface.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So during our lives, we
move across the surface

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.960 align:middle line:84%
of the planet from
one place to another,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, if we share
vibrational frequencies

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
with other people, it's
inevitable that at some point

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
we will ultimately cross
paths just as proteins

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:84%
do in what is called
chromatography or gel

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:90%
electrophoresis.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's a very
interesting understanding

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:84%
that we will ultimately meet
up, if we continue our movement,

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
with people that share our
vibrational frequencies.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And there are very
exciting opportunities

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
when we do because at that
moment, when you start

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:84%
to encounter the person that
has a complementary frequency

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to you, the harmonic
resonance actually

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:90%
empowers your own vibration.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.410 align:middle line:90%
We call it "good vibes."

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:10%
And in that regard,
you can actually

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:10%
identify people that
are in some way related

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:10%
to you and your harmonics
because if their vibration is

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:10%
similar to you, the two
of them coming together

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:10%
is called constructive
interference, which empowers

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:10%
each of the individuals,
and that empowerment

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:10%
is physically felt as much
more energy in your body.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And we refer to this, as I
mentioned, as "good vibes,"

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:18.560 align:middle line:84%
so that we actually have a
sensory system, an awareness,

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.150 align:middle line:84%
of when people that
are very similar to us,

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
or supportive of complementary
to us, come into our field.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I should also
acknowledge that there

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:84%
are other people who
actually cancel our energies

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:90%
just as well--

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.696 align:middle line:84%
that's called destructive
interference--

00:29:31.696 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
so that when some
people come together,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:84%
they actually lose
energy and feel weaker.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And we refer to
that as "bad vibes."

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So the nature of
our communications

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
are there is a vibrational
communication that precedes

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:90%
our verbal communication.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> As we realize we are
communicating in the present

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
moment with our future soul
matches, business partners,

00:29:54.950 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
mentors, spiritual teachers,
and even God at a distance,

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:84%
we can understand how to
co-create our own reality.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:24.590 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Once we understand the
concept that we are constantly

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:31.820 align:middle line:10%
broadcasting our personal
energy signature into the field

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:10%
and we're also receiving
messages from the field,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.100 align:middle line:10%
we can see how we can focus
and actually attract not only

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:10%
our soulmates and soul matches,
but our future business

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.970 align:middle line:10%
partners, and actually creating
a future career for ourselves

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.570 align:middle line:10%
that is more harmonious
to who we really are.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:10%
We can also see how
we can use the field

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:10%
to attract our
spiritual teachers.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:10%
We want to find teachers
that resonate with where

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:10%
we want to go with
our spirituality,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:10%
regardless of our religion, but
also how we can use the field

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:10%
to create a dialogue
with the universe itself.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're an architect,
an astronomer, a biologist,

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:84%
a medical doctor, a musician,
an artist, or even a student,

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.550 align:middle line:84%
by creating this dialogue with
these super intelligent levels

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:84%
of the field and expanding
our consciousness ultimately

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.870 align:middle line:84%
into the nine levels
of the cosmos, the nine

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.630 align:middle line:84%
levels of the angelic, the
nine levels of the field,

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.600 align:middle line:84%
we can get the answers to
anything we can imagine--

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
the cure for AIDS, the cure for
biofuels, the next biofuels.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.230 align:middle line:84%
We can find the secrets
to nuclear fusion.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We can find the secrets to
unlimited zero-point energy.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We can find the secrets
to the next song,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.150 align:middle line:90%
the next generation of music.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:84%
All of that information is
available to us in this field

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:90%
if we can tap into it.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We can even begin to
formulate a dialogue to awaken

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.550 align:middle line:84%
our own inner genius
and true potential.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:07.540 align:middle line:10%
One of the ways that
we can access and train

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.310 align:middle line:10%
a more quantum, broader field
range of awareness, a more

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:16.780 align:middle line:10%
expansive state of awareness, is
to begin to encourage ourselves

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:22.000 align:middle line:10%
to see things not so much in
terms of concepts and ideas,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:10%
but more in terms of
pure energy itself,

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.865 align:middle line:10%
so that you begin to
perceive what is normally

00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:10%
you would label it and you'd
say, wow, that's a rose

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:10%
or that's a car
or that's a tree--

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:10%
you would just begin to teach
yourself, guide yourself,

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:10%
into feeling the pure
energy of that experience

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:10%
as though you are in a
state of innocent wonder.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:10%
>> And then-- so what this does
is that it frees your whole

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:10%
cortical field.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:10%
It's like, just because
you detach yourself

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:10%
from looking at the world
in terms of ideas doesn't

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:10%
mean you lose those ideas.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:04.820 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it helps you to
free your informational field

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
up so when now, when
you encourage yourself

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to go into really deep states of
peaceful, peaceful quiet, core

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:20.050 align:middle line:84%
being relaxation quiet, when you
learn to penetrate to the very

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
core essence of
the quantum field

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:84%
itself, what you start to
feel is an incredible harmonic

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.580 align:middle line:90%
peacefulness.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have a meditation
which encourages

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:84%
you to enter into that state
of pure, unattached to ideas,

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:84%
pure energy awareness, complete
peaceful, brilliant stillness.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:53.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And as you enter
that, what we now

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:84%
know from studies
of creative genius,

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's often exactly when
we're in the most relaxed,

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:84%
most sort of open-minded
spaces, that we begin our brain

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:90%
process because it's now free.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It's suddenly like the
electrical circuitry

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:19.874 align:middle line:84%
is no longer confined to
our old thought spaces.

00:34:19.874 --> 00:34:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So when our cortex can suddenly
flash up with something

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.690 align:middle line:84%
like akin to a super
light, like the light

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:84%
of our awareness
within our awareness

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.920 align:middle line:84%
fields can suddenly flash
into our whole brain

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:84%
field in a much more
core contextual way,

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and we start to holographically
insight instead of think.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.520 align:middle line:90%
We start to get picture images.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.030 align:middle line:84%
We start to see
potential solutions that

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.830 align:middle line:90%
are way more holographic.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.670 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:84%
For a description
of the difference

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:84%
between holographing
and thinking,

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.790 align:middle line:84%
if you were to think of,
say, a round basketball,

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and if you were to
take a 1-diameter slice

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:84%
of that basketball in
an attempt to understand

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:84%
a whole field of information,
what you'd end up

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:90%
is with two polarized opposites.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.716 align:middle line:84%
You would have,
like, an either/or,

00:35:16.716 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:84%
or a right or a left position,
or a good or a bad position.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have an argument
because you've polarized

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.560 align:middle line:90%
the informational field.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And you tend to look at that
informational field in terms

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
of being somewhere
along that band--

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the center, I'm on
the right, I'm on the left--

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.990 align:middle line:84%
whereas when we insight, if you
could picture that same ball,

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
guess how many diameters
there are inside

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.950 align:middle line:90%
of a whole field of information.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.330 align:middle line:84%
There is an infinite
number of diameters

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that you can put
through a whole field.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So the difference between
thinking and insighting

00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:84%
is when you let the core of that
circle of information, which

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
is your brain field,
you allow the energy

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to expand in every
direction simultaneously

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:12.670 align:middle line:84%
from the core to the boundaries,
you get an instantaneous flash

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:13.870 align:middle line:90%
of insight.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:90%
You get a hologram.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you see solutions
in terms of huge, like, wow.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
how Einstein insighted

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:90%
the theory of relativity.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.940 align:middle line:10%
It came to him in an instant.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.390 align:middle line:84%
It took him two years
to try to explain

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.750 align:middle line:84%
what he saw in that instant
through conventional linear

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.430 align:middle line:90%
sequential logics.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking
about is teaching

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.890 align:middle line:84%
people, opening people to
a new level of awareness

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:84%
in which they begin to support
their intelligence field,

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to jump into quantum
field holographing

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to thinking.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> If we awaken to the idea
that the universe itself is

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
intelligent, could we
create a dialogue with it?

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:90%
What is the universal language?

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
How can we learn to listen
to the cosmic conversation?

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Many scientific studies at top
universities around the world

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:84%
have confirmed that
consciousness can

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:90%
affect the structure of water.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Water has been
demonstrated to have memory

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
in numerous studies, that
our thoughts and feelings can

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.670 align:middle line:90%
be recorded by water.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:84%
As water is made of two parts
hydrogen and one part oxygen,

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:84%
we can deduct that
hydrogen has memory.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are
made of nearly 90%

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:84%
water, trace
minerals, and oxygen.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Our Sun is also made of the
same stuff we are made of--

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:84%
91% hydrogen, helium, trace
oxygen, and trace minerals.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen was created
less than 100 seconds

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:09.790 align:middle line:84%
after the Big Bang, the
creation of the universe,

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and established itself as
the most abundant element

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.540 align:middle line:90%
in the entire universe.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:21.160 align:middle line:84%
The massive spiral arms
of the Milky Way galaxy

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:84%
is hundreds of billions of stars
and planets are made mostly

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:32.490 align:middle line:84%
of hydrogen. 75% of the
visible mass of our galaxy

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:90%
is made of hydrogen.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.060 align:middle line:84%
While hydrogen has
memory, could our galaxy's

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:84%
spiral arms, the
Sun, and the billions

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.260 align:middle line:84%
of stars in the Milky
Way galaxy actually hold

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:84%
all of the cosmic memories
of its entire history?

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Could this be where the great
akashic records, archiving

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.980 align:middle line:90%
all of human history, are held?

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.320 align:middle line:10%
What if we could
create a dialogue

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.400 align:middle line:10%
with this enormous
memory system?

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.670 align:middle line:84%
We could know the
answer to any question

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and solve any problem
or any limitation.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.980 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:10%
>> The language that
the spiritual people--

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:24.200 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual people
meaning the medicine

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:10%
people, the different religious
groups within the Zuni tribe--

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:38.540 align:middle line:10%
when they go into a religious
communication system,

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.000 align:middle line:10%
they talk about
the origins of who

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.230 align:middle line:10%
they are talking to in a
lot of cases, especially

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:10%
in the medicine
world, is that they're

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:10%
talking about the star people.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And all the other
related priests,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:90%
they call them priesthood.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.640 align:middle line:84%
In one-- for example, in one
section of the prayer system,

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.450 align:middle line:84%
there's a specific
line or a phrase

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.870 align:middle line:84%
or a group within a
prayer that talks strictly

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:16.600 align:middle line:84%
about the night beings
and the upper world

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:90%
priesthood, they call it.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the only one
that is referenced

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:84%
as a male and female entity
and the star of the sky

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
people, the night people
priesthood, and the finish line

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in that is that they only
appear instantaneously.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.720 align:middle line:84%
That's one line in
the prayer system.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.730 align:middle line:84%
There are so many different
parts to the prayer system,

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:84%
depending on the specialty of
that particular medicine group.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a language of
the universe, a language,

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:04.620 align:middle line:84%
if uttered with perfection, the
secret forces of the universe

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:90%
could be activated?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.870 align:middle line:10%
When we examine some of
the most ancient languages

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:middle line:10%
in the history of the world--

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:16.800 align:middle line:10%
such as ancient Hebrew,
the Vedas, Aramaic,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:10%
and the Native American
Indian dialects--

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.500 align:middle line:10%
we find that these
prayers were designed

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.880 align:middle line:10%
to invoke spiritual
healing and powerful forces

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.290 align:middle line:10%
of the conscious universe.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:49.490 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that is
that during the night time,

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:53.540 align:middle line:84%
the night priesthood,
including the female--

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:59.090 align:middle line:84%
they come-- and also I'm
talking about the priesthood

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:00.380 align:middle line:90%
of the universe--

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:05.040 align:middle line:84%
they only come and show
themself instantaneously

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:84%
is what that passage means when
you're doing it in prayers.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:12.180 align:middle line:84%
When we communicate,
then, with directly,

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.740 align:middle line:90%
that is a prayer that they use.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The language of the Zuni
is a very unique language

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:84%
in that there is no
other Indian tribe that

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.540 align:middle line:84%
has any connection
with the Zuni language.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The Zuni is a standalone
language system.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:10%
It is determined by the people
that study the languages

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:10%
and try to connect it
with other Indian tribes,

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.140 align:middle line:10%
say, like the Hopi or
the existing Pueblo

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:10%
tribes around
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:10%
and even clear down to
the Azteco Inca tribes,

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.000 align:middle line:10%
and the ethnologists
and the linguists

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:10%
have never found any connection
to any of the Zuni language.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a standalone
system by itself

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:84%
as far as the
language is concerned.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Do all ancient dialects
go back to the same source,

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:18.841 align:middle line:84%
the sounds of nature, and the
sounds of the universe itself?

00:43:18.841 --> 00:43:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But Pleiades-- what took me
some time to understand is that

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:84%
in a prayer system, they
talk about all the different

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
directions, not only the
internal part of the Earth,

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:38.080 align:middle line:84%
the different directions, the
six directions of the Earth,

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.960 align:middle line:84%
boundaries up and down the east
and west, and north and south,

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.350 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they start giving
prayer to those people that are

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:84%
in the upper world, it starts
out with what the Zunis refer

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to as the [INAUDIBLE],, and
they're referred to as priests

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:90%
or gods--

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.650 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE],,
then the next one

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:15.530 align:middle line:84%
is the Moon and the Sun, the
Big Dipper, and as it goes up,

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.765 align:middle line:90%
then it talks about seven.

00:44:17.765 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The seven took me a
long time to figure out.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.420 align:middle line:90%
That was referring to Pleiades.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Pleiades having that seventh
star group, or whatever

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:32.480 align:middle line:84%
it is, and then above that is
the supernova, the supernova

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:90%
group.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the specific
functions of the medicine order

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:45.120 align:middle line:84%
society, then again it expands
into other star systems

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and also certain stars or
planets in the universe,

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:02.090 align:middle line:84%
depending on what their
specific order is over there

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:05.100 align:middle line:90%
or their medicine group is.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:10.195 align:middle line:84%
And those are kept pretty well
secret among those societies.

00:45:10.195 --> 00:45:14.790 align:middle line:84%
The Zuni, even though their
medicine orders are the same,

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the specific groups have
their own references

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we don't
know what the other society

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:90%
references are.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:30.916 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of Pleiades,
it's very specific.

00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's incredible.

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying the elders
could talk to gods or goddesses

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.760 align:middle line:90%
from different star systems.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:41.545 --> 00:45:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The Ancient Hebrew name of
God is a name that cannot be

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:52.270 align:middle line:84%
uttered or heard by the human
ear because it has no vowels

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.700 align:middle line:90%
to move air through it.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The name literally cannot be
uttered or heard by the human

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.200 align:middle line:84%
ear, and as vowels
are introduced to it,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:08.470 align:middle line:84%
the phonetics of the letters
YHWH produces sounds so low

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.260 align:middle line:90%
in frequency it cannot be heard.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:17.578 align:middle line:90%


00:46:17.578 --> 00:46:20.370 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the
Sun was considered

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.240 align:middle line:84%
by most ancient religions
as the most sacred sound

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.910 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It is a sound that cannot
be heard by the human ear

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:38.151 align:middle line:84%
because the human ear only hears
between 20 and 20,000 hertz .

00:46:38.151 --> 00:46:42.300 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the Sun is
much lower in frequency

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.815 align:middle line:84%
and also much higher in
frequency than we can hear.

00:46:46.815 --> 00:46:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Could the sound of the Sun be
part of the universal language

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.360 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:57.975 align:middle line:84%
NASA has recorded the actual
sound of the Sun in deep space

00:46:57.975 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and compressed the
inaudible waves so

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.490 align:middle line:90%
that human ears can hear it.

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:08.580 align:middle line:84%
If we listen to the sound,
we can hear and feel

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.894 align:middle line:90%
a deep vibration.

00:47:11.894 --> 00:47:15.220 align:middle line:10%
The sound of the
Sun recorded by NASA

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.700 align:middle line:10%
is precisely as
the ancient Hindus

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.870 align:middle line:10%
had described it in the
Vedas thousands of years ago.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:27.817 align:middle line:84%
It is a mantra that can be
intoned with human speed

00:47:27.817 --> 00:47:29.308 align:middle line:90%
as "om."

00:47:29.308 --> 00:47:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:54.750 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth century
BC, Pythagoras also

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.920 align:middle line:84%
heard the sound of the
Sun and described it

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.090 align:middle line:84%
as a deep resonant hum with
higher frequencies blended

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.740 align:middle line:84%
How did the ancient
Hindus know this mantra

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.370 align:middle line:84%
if it could not be
heard by the human ear?

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Could they have actually
peered into the universal

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.400 align:middle line:90%
consciousness and perceived it?

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.240 align:middle line:84%
As human language and the
language of nature cannot

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.700 align:middle line:84%
travel faster than the speed
of sound as a sound wave,

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.760 align:middle line:84%
language as information can
travel at the speed of light

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and beyond by entangling
itself on more subtle energies.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that we can send
human voices our music on radio

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:44.280 align:middle line:84%
waves at the speed of light,
we can send our own dialogue,

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.820 align:middle line:84%
personal energy
signature, and information

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.940 align:middle line:84%
through our own
biophoton light emissions

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.400 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.200 align:middle line:84%
While the speed of light is
useful to communicate within

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.970 align:middle line:84%
the solar system, it cannot
take us far beyond it in any

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.580 align:middle line:90%
reasonable amount of time.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.180 align:middle line:84%
In this way, biophoton
emissions are limited,

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:84%
while more subtle
bioenergies are not.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tiller's discovery
of the psychic force

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.410 align:middle line:84%
as subtle energies emanating
from the human body

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:20.550 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness demonstrates
how our personal information

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.640 align:middle line:84%
can travel on subtle
energy frequencies

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light
squared, cubed, and beyond.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.750 align:middle line:10%
In my modeling,
which I developed

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:42.052 align:middle line:10%
from a deep meditative
state in the early 1970s--

00:49:42.052 --> 00:49:43.760 align:middle line:10%
the model that eventually
appeared to me,

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.150 align:middle line:10%
which I wrote down in my first
psychoenergetic book, which

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.830 align:middle line:10%
I didn't publish
for about 30 years.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:51.792 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1997.

00:49:51.792 --> 00:49:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was "Science
and Human Transformation:

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Subtle Energies, Intentionality,
and Consciousness."

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So in that, I draw
a Minkowski diagram

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:10.400 align:middle line:84%
with the standard
cone kind of thing,

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:84%
but there were several
cones where the events occur

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.490 align:middle line:84%
inside the normal
light cone of Minkowski

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:21.870 align:middle line:84%
as the coordinates
of distance and time.

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:24.060 align:middle line:84%
The limitation of
the walls on the cone

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:90%
is velocity of light c.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The next one, the limits, which
is the magnetic information

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.500 align:middle line:90%
wave domain, is c square.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The next one, which is the
motion domain, is c cubed.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the next one at the mind
domain, c to the fourth.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.380 align:middle line:90%
And beyond that-- spirit.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So again, until you
can make measurements,

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.070 align:middle line:84%
we will not be able to
check these kinds of things.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.430 align:middle line:84%
But they're internally
self-consistent with a variety

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of stuff, and they give us
a lot of hope and optimism

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.700 align:middle line:84%
that if we will ever
get out of this box

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:07.260 align:middle line:84%
that orthodox science
is stuck in, then

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:11.400 align:middle line:84%
they will have a marvelous,
marvelous adventure in learning

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.960 align:middle line:90%
more about nature.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the power of meditation
so profound that we can expand

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:21.990 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness into the
cosmos and perceive the actual

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:84%
sound of the Sun
and the universe?

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.700 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the fascinating things
about psychic phenomena is that

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:10%
they seem to travel
much faster than light.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.750 align:middle line:10%
And a piece of evidence to
back that up-- and there are

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:39.660 align:middle line:10%
actually now several
experiments-- but the first one

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.140 align:middle line:10%
that I learned about was
by a Russian scientist

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.130 align:middle line:10%
named Potchivian.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:47.670 align:middle line:10%
Probably back in the
early '60s, I believe,

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:51.240 align:middle line:10%
he was working with acupuncture
and measuring the voltages

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:10%
on the acupoints on the body.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Acupuncture, as you know,
there are certain points

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.770 align:middle line:84%
on the body that the Chinese
medicine stipulates has

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:02.510 align:middle line:90%
certain electrical properties.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.280 align:middle line:84%
As Potchivian was
measuring the voltages,

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:10.050 align:middle line:84%
he saw a curious spike
in them and wondered what

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:12.450 align:middle line:90%
the cause of the spike was.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Later, he learned there had
been a solar flare at the moment

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.160 align:middle line:90%
that he saw this voltage spike.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:25.290 align:middle line:84%
What was strange is that the
spike occurred 8.3 minutes

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:28.860 align:middle line:84%
before we would be able
to see that solar flare

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.130 align:middle line:84%
because light travels
at a limited speed.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It takes 8.3 minutes for
light to get from the Sun

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.690 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:39.284 align:middle line:84%
But his spikes showed
up instantaneously.

00:52:39.284 --> 00:52:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
evidence that there

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.250 align:middle line:84%
is something that travels
much faster than light that

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.560 align:middle line:84%
affects the body and affects
the acupuncture system,

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and we can measure
it physically.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Since then, the Russians
have done a lot of work

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:55.200 align:middle line:84%
on what they call torsion,
which is their version

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.900 align:middle line:90%
of the same psychic force.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And they do find there's
an element of that that

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:04.410 align:middle line:84%
does travel much faster
than light so that now

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.020 align:middle line:84%
even telescopes
have been devised

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.910 align:middle line:90%
which can measure this energy.

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And they show that that signal
does travel faster than light.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again, another
revolutionary aspect of physics

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that most Western scientists
are just ignoring,

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:23.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's really important.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Our bodies are made
of about 90% plus water,

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.200 align:middle line:84%
which is hydrogen, oxygen, and
we're also made of minerals

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and carbon.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.640 align:middle line:84%
The Sun is made of over
90% hydrogen, trace oxygen,

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.480 align:middle line:90%
and trace minerals, and helium.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It's made of almost
the same stuff we are.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So inversely, if
the Sun can send us

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.810 align:middle line:84%
telepathic messages faster
than the speed of light,

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:48.420 align:middle line:84%
we can send the Sun
telepathic messages faster

00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:49.950 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is every
11 years, according to NASA,

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.670 align:middle line:84%
we come into solar
maximums where

00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:02.040 align:middle line:84%
solar flares are a potential
threat to our planet.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:07.090 align:middle line:84%
If we can learn to pray and talk
to the Sun as a living being,

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:09.780 align:middle line:84%
not as a god, not as
the god of creation,

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:84%
but if we can talk to the
Sun as a living being,

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.910 align:middle line:84%
can we collectively, with
billions of minds together,

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:22.290 align:middle line:84%
ask the Sun to calm itself,
to harmonize itself with us

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:23.110 align:middle line:90%
and not to harm us?

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Can we do that?

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Are our collective
minds that powerful?

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> If we consider Dr.
Tiller's model once again,

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:35.100 align:middle line:84%
realizing that consciousness
is operating in a domain beyond

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.640 align:middle line:84%
the gamma ray spectrum,
consciousness has the power

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.930 align:middle line:90%
to create a universe.

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Considering a short,
10-second gamma ray burst

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.720 align:middle line:84%
from a supernova will release
more energy than our Sun

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.040 align:middle line:84%
will in its entire
multi-billion year lifetime,

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.340 align:middle line:84%
consciousness in the
magnetoelectric spectrum

00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and beyond is even more
powerful than that.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.510 align:middle line:10%
If we could access this
through coherent awareness,

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:08.650 align:middle line:10%
we could become like
gods and goddesses.

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, we are all spirits
having a physical experience

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.650 align:middle line:84%
as we ride the river
of life together.

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:33.520 align:middle line:10%
Our spiritual parents dressed
us in these bio bodysuits,

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.460 align:middle line:10%
put us in this playpen
that we call a universe,

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:39.010 align:middle line:10%
in order to grow in
coherence, in order

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:41.455 align:middle line:10%
to develop our gifts
of intentionality,

00:55:41.455 --> 00:55:44.650 align:middle line:10%
and in order to become what
we were intended to become--

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:48.140 align:middle line:10%
co-creators with our
spiritual parents.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And co-creator means
to eventually evolve

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:55.690 align:middle line:84%
into the place where you
could interact with planets

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and you could co-create
planets or stars.

00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's in the game,
as far as I see it.

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We're not anywhere near
the end of physics,

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.260 align:middle line:90%
the theory of everything.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.840 align:middle line:84%
We are just babes
crawling across the floor

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.310 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.980 align:middle line:84%
We've hardly begun
the great adventure.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things are possible.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.064 align:middle line:90%
We manipulate this universe.

00:56:22.064 --> 00:56:23.230 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's here for us.

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's our classroom-- no other
way to become co-creators

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:31.060 align:middle line:90%
on this magnificent scale.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's in our future
from this planet's level

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:38.710 align:middle line:90%
of activity.

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:41.320 align:middle line:84%
We have to move
and become coherent

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.630 align:middle line:90%
at the deeper levels of nature.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Using Einstein's equation
of converting frequencies

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.870 align:middle line:84%
into mass energy, the
higher the frequency,

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.870 align:middle line:90%
the higher the energy.

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Any frequency into the
gamma ray spectrum,

00:56:55.780 --> 00:57:00.520 align:middle line:84%
the magnetoelectric spectrum
and beyond, coupled with matter,

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.730 align:middle line:84%
has the power to create
anything we can imagine,

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:08.950 align:middle line:84%
including the solar system,
the galaxy, and the universe.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The coherence at this
level of nature is very good.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we can make lasers.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:22.510 align:middle line:10%
We can convert the potential
of a light bulb from 50 watts

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:28.930 align:middle line:10%
to create temperatures 10 times
the surface of the Sun, if you

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.840 align:middle line:10%
can make all those
electromagnetic photons

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.790 align:middle line:10%
coherent.

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But the dimensionality
of the higher dimensions,

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.830 align:middle line:84%
just as this one, if you look
at the most coherent aspect

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:46.360 align:middle line:84%
for electromagnetic laser, is
the wavelength of the light

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.380 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with,
so that now if you

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:55.660 align:middle line:84%
go to the next level of the
vacuum magnetic information

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.750 align:middle line:84%
wave level, you've
changed the size

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:02.140 align:middle line:84%
scale by 10 orders of magnitude,
and then to the next level

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.200 align:middle line:84%
another 10 orders of magnitude,
and the next level another 10

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.070 align:middle line:90%
orders of magnitude.

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And so to be coherent at those
inner levels, really coherent,

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the energy densities are
beyond your imagining.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.420 align:middle line:10%
So it isn't just that it
goes c, c squared, c cubed,

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.872 align:middle line:10%
c to the fourth.

00:58:20.872 --> 00:58:23.860 align:middle line:10%
The size scale goes
down and down and down.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.190 align:middle line:10%
The wavelength goes
up and up and up.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And the power
ultimately is huge.

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, all of the
things I've talked about

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.880 align:middle line:90%
appear to be possible.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It is information at this
level of reality that tells

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.270 align:middle line:90%
matter what to do.

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness at the
magnetoelectric spectrum

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and beyond can also power
a spacecraft at the speed

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:55.930 align:middle line:90%
of light squared and beyond.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Does this give us
a new understanding

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and a new vision of God?

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.540 align:middle line:10%
"When you make the
two into one, you

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.780 align:middle line:10%
will become children of Adam.

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.610 align:middle line:10%
And when you say, mountain,
move from here, it will move--"

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:14.935 align:middle line:10%
Jesus, the Gospel of Thomas.

00:59:14.935 --> 00:59:17.800 align:middle line:90%


00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:21.460 align:middle line:84%
By tapping into just a small
amount of this consciousness,

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.430 align:middle line:84%
certainly we could
change the weather

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and we could talk to the Sun
to ask it to do anything.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:32.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Imagine for a moment
if a hurricane was coming

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.920 align:middle line:10%
in the future.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.180 align:middle line:10%
But now, instead of what
we're doing with the weather

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:40.000 align:middle line:10%
forecasts, which we're
amplifying the fear

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.220 align:middle line:10%
and looking at all the
blowing of the winds and all

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.920 align:middle line:10%
the torment zone,
imagined instead

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:51.430 align:middle line:10%
we had millions or billions of
people simultaneously engaged

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:57.950 align:middle line:10%
in an organized, synchronized,
guided imagery over the media,

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:03.040 align:middle line:10%
ascending loving intentions and
calming intentions to a storm,

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.880 align:middle line:10%
or even was redirecting
it to a safer environment.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Would we find that the
storm has diminished?

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.875 align:middle line:84%
Would we find that the
storm might be moved?

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll never discover
it unless we look for it.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.340 align:middle line:84%
If we don't ask the questions
and we don't try it,

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.510 align:middle line:84%
we'll never know whether
it matters or not.

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The key to talking to
nature is to know its harmonic

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:28.830 align:middle line:90%
language.

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:34.180 align:middle line:10%
When we examine this photo of
ordinary water flash frozen

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:37.470 align:middle line:10%
while it was exposed to
the sound of the Sun,

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:43.110 align:middle line:10%
we can see it transforms from
its ordinary state of disorder

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:46.710 align:middle line:10%
into the most perfect
sacred geometry.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:50.070 align:middle line:10%
Is there a purpose to the
Sun's sound waves broadcasting

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:52.380 align:middle line:10%
throughout the solar system?

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.600 align:middle line:10%
Is it a sort of language?

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Does the sound of the Sun bring
order to the nine planets?

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras discovered
that all of the planets

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
were producing a
sort of cosmic music

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
he called the music
of the spheres.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
When NASA recorded
the sounds of Saturn,

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.028 align:middle line:90%
researchers were in awe--

01:01:16.028 --> 01:01:27.260 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.870 align:middle line:90%
the sound of Uranus--

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:47.865 align:middle line:90%


01:01:47.865 --> 01:01:50.005 align:middle line:90%
the sound of Jupiter--

01:01:50.005 --> 01:02:08.340 align:middle line:90%


01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.293 align:middle line:90%
the sound of the Earth.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:34.990 align:middle line:90%


01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
When we hear the
sound of the Earth,

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
we can see it sounds deeply
similar to the sounds of birds

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.580 align:middle line:90%
singing.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:52.250 align:middle line:90%


01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
NASA scientists
were astounded when

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
they heard the sounds of
the Earth for the first time

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
because they knew
the birds understood

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the secret language of the
universe and the Earth itself.

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:10.605 align:middle line:84%
They were singing as if in a
dialogue with the creation.

01:03:10.605 --> 01:03:13.430 align:middle line:90%


01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
When Pythagoras had
finished his studies

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
into the music of
the planets, he

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:23.040 align:middle line:84%
gave birth to the intervallic
system of modern music,

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and thus classical
music was born.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:30.570 align:middle line:10%
The musica
instrumentalis, of course,

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:34.345 align:middle line:10%
is the music we hear people sing
or instruments play, and then

01:03:34.345 --> 01:03:36.880 align:middle line:10%
the musica humana,
Pythagoras said, is

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.610 align:middle line:10%
our sound, the one that we
create, that humans create.

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, the musica
mundana is the one

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:49.530 align:middle line:10%
that you're describing
here, and that's

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.360 align:middle line:10%
the music of the spheres.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And that music, let's not
think that it has to sound like

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
music, because really
it can just be a very

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
out-of-this-world, one-note
sound that sounds like one

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
note, but actually spreads
out into incredible harmonies.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And the way you reach that
point is truly by meditating

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.481 align:middle line:84%
or by going to a place,
hiking to a place,

01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
where you can be by yourself--
if you don't like meditating,

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.330 align:middle line:90%
just sitting quietly--

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
but it is a place that
when you're quiet,

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
you can't hear these sounds,
these harmonies of the spheres,

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
you can't hear them unless
you've actually integrated

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.870 align:middle line:90%
into your heart center.

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just not possible
because that's

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%
where the sound comes in.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And so again, the idea
of using your intuition,

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
your sixth sense, this is what
we're all getting into now.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
This whole new
millennium, I believe,

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
is about activating that again
and combining all the knowledge

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:52.080 align:middle line:84%
we have, letting go of it, and
allowing our hearts to listen

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.550 align:middle line:90%
to what's really out there.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And really where it begins--

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.350 align:middle line:84%
not so you don't feel like this
is a very complicated process--

01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
where it begins is to
hear your own inner voice.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.280 align:middle line:84%
That's really key is when
you hear yourself giving

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
the answers, not somebody
outside of yourself,

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:11.172 align:middle line:84%
not the media, not your
husband or wife, your friend,

01:05:11.172 --> 01:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
your family telling
you what to do,

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
but you actually
tune in to yourself.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
tuning in, you

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
have tuned to the
music of the spheres.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:23.250 align:middle line:10%
The tuning in is what's
necessary to hear

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.490 align:middle line:10%
the great cosmic music
that's out there,

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:30.120 align:middle line:10%
which is all about you because
you're part of creation.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.680 align:middle line:90%
You're creating this music.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So tuning in will allow
you to not only hear it,

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.180 align:middle line:84%
but also to participate
in it as well.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%

I actually can sense
the signature of a song

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:25.990 align:middle line:10%
without knowing where
it's coming from.

Is it an aptitude?

I think I'm a receiver for this.

about God and humanity.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Those are always
my two subjects--

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the sense of separateness
that the human being feels

01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and how we try to
regain that connection

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
through relationships, romantic
relationships, and how that--

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
or things or whatever,
and how it disappoints us,

and that how there
is really only God.

01:07:44.588 --> 01:07:48.025 align:middle line:90%


01:07:48.025 --> 01:07:53.917 align:middle line:84%
Price was right for
these unnatural things.

01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:58.350 align:middle line:90%
They make it easier to hide.

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesus spoke the
Lord's Prayer in Aramaic,

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
a language that is at
least 3,000 years old.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Was this language also
consistent with tonalities

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:16.069 align:middle line:84%
of the hidden
forces of creation?

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Was Jesus' intention
combined with Aramaic

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:26.990 align:middle line:84%
language so powerful he could
manifest the loaves and fishes

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:30.630 align:middle line:90%
needed to feed the masses?

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:35.790 align:middle line:84%
The shape of a fish in
geometry is the vesica pisces,

01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:39.899 align:middle line:84%
formed when two circles
of the same diameter

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.340 align:middle line:90%
cross one another.

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:47.290 align:middle line:84%
The ratio of a vesica
pisces, width to its height,

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is 153 to 265, or
the square root of 3,

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.760 align:middle line:90%
the number of the trinity.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:05.319 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel of John 2:1-11,
Jesus caught 153 fish at a time

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
when the disciples could
not catch a single one.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
why is the number

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
153 in code with the creation
of the shape of a fish?

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Was Jesus speaking in a
harmonic code language

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.399 align:middle line:84%
to manifest the
loaves and fishes?

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:30.914 align:middle line:84%
Did he know the secret
language of creation itself?

01:09:30.914 --> 01:09:40.580 align:middle line:90%


01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:44.420 align:middle line:10%
>> People ask me all the
time, what is divine dialogue,

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.609 align:middle line:10%
and who are you talking to?

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:49.209 align:middle line:10%
Now, it really depends
on what you believe.

01:09:49.209 --> 01:09:50.750 align:middle line:10%
There's a friend of
mine who believes

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.170 align:middle line:10%
that Jesus comes to him.

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:53.711 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
it's you, David.

01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:57.240 align:middle line:90%


01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't do Jesus like that.

01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:01.880 align:middle line:90%
It's like, my belief--

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, and another friend of mine
is a devout Roman Catholic

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and an extraordinary medium.

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And they believe they're
talking to Mother Mary.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that the
consciousness of those

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
avatars, if you will,
the consciousness

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.830 align:middle line:90%
of those extraordinary beings--

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
who even knows if they
were human or not, right?

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we don't know.

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But that is living and
we can tap into that.

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:29.990 align:middle line:90%
But it sure isn't in us.

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I can say that that information
can come through me.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So is this the white
guy god in the sky?

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm going to say, no way.

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:38.840 align:middle line:90%
But am I right about that?

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.730 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that there
is an extraordinary matrix

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
of creativity, a
living consciousness,

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:49.580 align:middle line:84%
a divine intelligence, that
I don't know what it is.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And I can only understand
that intelligence

01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
to a subjective experience
when I have that genius moment

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and I know it
doesn't come from me.

01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing,
too, is that there are so

01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
many studies now that
are trying to find that.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.400 align:middle line:90%
What is God?

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
What is the great
organizing designer?

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
We really need to step
out of our language,

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is what I think we have to
do, and forget our labels.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.260 align:middle line:84%
The past can't tell us this,
because as a matter of fact,

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.250 align:middle line:84%
the past is always talking
about the people who

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:27.140 align:middle line:90%
tried to figure it out then.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that's their
version of it.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:31.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's outmoded now.

01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:32.650 align:middle line:90%
We have to find new ways.

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Look at nature.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:34.800 align:middle line:90%
you hold a rose.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.870 align:middle line:90%
Can you make one?

01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:36.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Who made that?

01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell me it's just
a gene or a DNA strand.

01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't buy that.

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:45.200 align:middle line:90%
And if it is, what informs that?

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
What is the environment
that informs

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
one thing to be one thing
and one thing to another?

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And where does
consciousness come from?

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:53.070 align:middle line:90%
And how are we born?

01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Do we come from other planets?

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I think any of that is possible.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.330 align:middle line:10%
But to answer someone when
they say, what is God,

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:06.650 align:middle line:10%
well, God to me is a divining,
organizing intelligence,

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:09.350 align:middle line:10%
creative intelligence,
that houses,

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:13.310 align:middle line:10%
if you will, the individuated
intelligences of those who

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:18.860 align:middle line:10%
have come before us, like
Buddha, like Christ, like

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.930 align:middle line:10%
whoever you can
think of, all these--

01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:21.820 align:middle line:10%
like Einstein.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.669 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being able to come
up with a lost mathematical

01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
equation when I don't even
know how to count-- come on,

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.860 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty wild.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.500 align:middle line:90%


01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The HeartMath Institute's
Global Coherence Initiative

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
uses scientific technology
to perceive electromagnetic

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
changes in the Earth's
ionosphere that are coherent

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:45.440 align:middle line:90%
with global human consciousness.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the human heart produces
electromagnetic energies

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and even more powerful
subtle energies,

01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
millions or even billions
of human hearts experiencing

01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:58.790 align:middle line:84%
profound emotions due
to global coherence

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
initiatives, or global events,
will cause measurable changes

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's
ionosphere to appear.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
These changes will prove
to science and the world

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the power of human emotions
on a global and cosmic scale.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Our researchers in a team
that they've assembled are

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.720 align:middle line:84%
building what's called the
Global Coherence Monitoring

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.370 align:middle line:90%
System.

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:25.010 align:middle line:10%
This is a system
that's being made up

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:29.480 align:middle line:10%
of very sensitive sensors that
measure changes in the Earth's

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.350 align:middle line:10%
ionosphere.

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:32.510 align:middle line:10%
The ionosphere is the
Earth's protective layer

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:33.890 align:middle line:10%
around the Earth.

01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:36.470 align:middle line:10%
And these sensors can
measure very subtle changes

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:38.450 align:middle line:10%
in the ionosphere.

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:41.540 align:middle line:10%
The goal is, over the
next two to three years,

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.230 align:middle line:10%
maybe a little longer depending
on how fast the project moves,

01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:46.940 align:middle line:10%
is we want to put between
50 and 100 of these sensors

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:50.060 align:middle line:10%
around the globe, have
them all network back

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.150 align:middle line:10%
to a central location, and be
able to get a complete picture

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:56.480 align:middle line:10%
of the ionosphere 24/7.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Our belief is that when there
are large numbers of people

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
feeling similar motions, mass
emotional output, that that

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.560 align:middle line:84%
could be detectable
in the ionosphere.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
We know from other research--
like Dr. Roger Nelson

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in the Global
Consciousness Project,

01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:13.790 align:middle line:84%
using random number
generators, showing changes

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
in these random
number generators when

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
this strong emotionality
occurring in the world,

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
like at 9/11.

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
There's other
indicators that show

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that there are possible
measurable changes that

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
occur when large numbers of
people are feeling something.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We want to conduct
experiments on the effect

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of positive emotional
states being

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
generated by large numbers of
people on the Earth itself.

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, sort
of metaphorically

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.926 align:middle line:84%
what we're attempting to do
is to measure the brain waves

01:14:42.926 --> 01:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and heart rhythms of
the planet itself.

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:48.950 align:middle line:90%


01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:53.640 align:middle line:10%
>> By engaging our consciousness
collectively into the global

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.270 align:middle line:10%
media and buying into the
violence and the fear and all

01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:00.990 align:middle line:10%
of the sensationalism,
collectively with six billion

01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:04.380 align:middle line:10%
minds on the planet we are
transmitting consciousness

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.960 align:middle line:10%
and reinforcing that delusion.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.340 align:middle line:10%
We're giving it more energy.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.230 align:middle line:10%
We're telling it
to maintain itself.

01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:12.960 align:middle line:10%
And possibly,
scientific researchers

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.790 align:middle line:10%
are finding that our
consciousness is actually

01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:19.050 align:middle line:10%
cooperatively
responsible for all this

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:22.290 align:middle line:10%
because consciousness is far
more powerful than we can even

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:24.270 align:middle line:10%
imagine.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The best example I see to
explain it is like the movie

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:32.400 align:middle line:10%
"Catch Me If You Can" where
Leonardo DiCaprio hides himself

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.190 align:middle line:10%
around 10 beautiful girls,
and the cops are all looking

01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:37.290 align:middle line:10%
at the beautiful girls,
and so he gets to sneak

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:39.000 align:middle line:10%
by, and that's kind of--

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.220 align:middle line:10%
we're completely
being distracted

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.280 align:middle line:10%
while these other
agendas are going on.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's putting
us down constantly.

01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, I'm better than
you, and just a lot of biasness

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.567 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:15:55.567 --> 01:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of sad that
we're giving a lot of our time

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:02.850 align:middle line:84%
to watching TV and speaking
as opposed to action

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and being the change out in the
world because the TV is always

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
going to report
about celebrities

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on in Hollywood
and news, which is only 2%

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the world is really negative,
and they're just focusing

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and amplifying on that.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it worse
than it actually is.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.093 align:middle line:84%
And particularly if we know
our thoughts create reality,

01:16:23.093 --> 01:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
if you have millions of people
seeing these images, what's

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
it doing to our world and our
psyche on a collective level?

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> You asked the bigger
field a question,

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.300 align:middle line:90%
and it feeds you the answer.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.040 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.450 align:middle line:10%
But the question
should be very precise.

01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:47.760 align:middle line:10%
You can't answer questions--
oh, what does it mean, universe?

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.916 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean, God?

01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:51.580 align:middle line:90%
It will be no answer.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you give
precise question, then

01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
you will get precise answer.

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
operate in some area,

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:04.047 align:middle line:84%
meditation will give you
what you want by itself.

01:17:04.047 --> 01:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%


01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the practice
of meditation, prayer,

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and insight, we can expand
our minds and consciousness

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:20.790 align:middle line:84%
into the nine levels of the
universal field of the angelic

01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:23.340 align:middle line:90%
kingdoms of God.

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The fields contain all
knowledge, all memories,

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and all possibilities.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
access them with our minds.

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
They have always
been there to serve

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
humanity and the universal
knowledge and presence.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Science is telling us that
the nine dimensional fields

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
are perceptible to the
mathematics of string theory.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Science now realizes
that there is

01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
a creative force in the
universe that is intelligent,

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that it responds
to our questions,

01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:05.260 align:middle line:84%
it gives us
creativity and insight

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.430 align:middle line:90%
as its intelligent answer.

01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:12.600 align:middle line:84%
With these gifts that enter
the mind, body, and soul,

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.320 align:middle line:90%
we can transform our world.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
With this new understanding
of physics and consciousness,

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
we can revolutionize our
understanding of God.

01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to forget
what we already know

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and what we have learned
from the past about God,

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
but we do have to move
forward and partake of what

01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:39.240 align:middle line:90%
we don't know and learn more.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
If more of us can create
an intelligent dialogue

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
with a conscious
universe, we might

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
see more genius-level solutions
to disease, suffering, war,

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:58.990 align:middle line:84%
architecture, banking,
and global politics.

01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We might even be able to
conquer the limitations

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
of fossil fuels, global climate
change, and the ecology.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
If we can discover anti-gravity
and the secret to limitless

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
zero-point energy, we might
see a golden space age

01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
where we will look
back at our old ideas

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and wonder why it took us so
long to build a global space

01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:34.411 align:middle line:84%
presence and enter the galactic
community of life beyond Earth.

01:19:34.411 --> 01:19:43.250 align:middle line:90%


01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:49.005 align:middle line:84%
From there, the conversation can
conquer the galaxy and beyond.

01:19:49.005 --> 01:19:52.235 align:middle line:90%
