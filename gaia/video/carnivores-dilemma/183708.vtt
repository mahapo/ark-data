There were other directions

possible?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
How can we exhibit

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And we are producing more
than 2,000 pigs per year.

from the industrial philosophy.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Our philosophy is based on
allowing the pigs to express

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
their natural instincts because
this promotes animal welfare,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and I think it promotes
health of the animals.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%

>> Here is something
we call a mud wallow.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the natural
instincts for a sow to remain

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:90%
cool because she cannot sweat.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And so in summertime, if
the weather is very hot,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
it's so important for
the sow to come here

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
occasionally during the
most hot time in the day.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:90%

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
You can see there
are about 12 pigs.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, this house is insulated.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And there is around 10
centimeters of insulation,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:90%
so the wall is quite thick.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's made of steel,
so it's very strong.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And in winter, it keeps
the sow quite warm.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And also it keeps the
heat out in summer

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
because we open the back
window and keep ventilation.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a more natural system.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The pig can grow
in its natural way

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
by living outside and
experiencing the earth.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Because a pig has this special
nose to dig in the earth,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and if it cannot have this,
then it's not complete.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not completely a pig.

Practitioners of the

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
say that we have
more piglets which

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
are crushed by their
mother, so this

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%
is something we got recently.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:90%
That house is bigger.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It looks the same
as the other house,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
but the one difference is,
this house is a bit larger.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And just to make the
house a bit larger

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:84%
could be the solution to
the problem of crushing.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.325 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true, it
could be a big success.

00:12:51.325 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:90%

of the other great scandals

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:84%
the extensive use of
antibiotics, is also possible.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of the crowding
that these animals experience

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
because of the ways
that they're raised,

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:90%
disease is a big problem.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So it developed that
antibiotics began

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:84%
to be given to animals
routinely, prophylactically,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:90%
to prevent disease.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And also, incidentally,
there was some evidence,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
there is some evidence,
that by giving antibiotics

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
to young animals,
you're making them

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
grow more quickly and
bigger because healthier

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
animals grow more
quickly and bigger.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:90%
So what's the problem with this?

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Because bacteria are
smart, able to adapt,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
they're breeding resistance
to these antibiotics.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:84%
As they do that in
the animal population,

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:84%
they transfer that
resistance to bacteria that

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%
affect the human population.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, we
are seeing increased number

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:84%
of infections,
people in hospitals

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and out of hospitals for
whom antibiotics don't work.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The number of people who die
from antibiotic-resistant

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:84%
bacterial infections in the
United States is about 25,000

a year and rising.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The number of people
who get sick and have

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:84%
trouble getting better is in
the hundreds of thousands.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:84%

not going to go away.

According to a British study, if
nothing changes, in 2050, this

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
could be the number one
cause of death in the world,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%

between the European
Union and the US

is we're not allowed to use
them unless the animal requires

medicine to prevent
death or suffering.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we use that antibiotic,
we need to separate,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:84%
we need to segregate that
treated animal from the rest

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and sell it to the
conventional system.

Just to walk amongst
the pigs in the field,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of therapy to
simply watch them run and play.

And so they are kept in
complete confinement.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Chicken production today is
that these birds have been bred

they develop leg injuries,

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:90%
they develop foot injuries.

weeks, their chests

have grown so large
that they tip forward.

They actually are permanently
unable to walk properly

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.515 align:middle line:84%

grow breast meat so quickly.

and the way that they--
they are always hungry

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that they eat and eat and eat so
they can grow very, very fast,

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
but that means lots of
problems for the animals.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%

The smell of bird
droppings is hard to bear.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:90%

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
From this point, I already

the living ones,

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and actually that
is pretty much.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about,
normally, in a farm like this,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
you have a mortality
rate of about 8%.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And that means that in a
farm like this, over the time

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
they are raised, 4,000 animals
die, not in slaughterhouses

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
but because of the
conditions here.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
the ground, that's

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:90%
all old shit from the animals.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Some are thirsty.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
They can't even
get to the water.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So when they can't stand
up, they will die of thirst.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
in a cage that is

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
going to lean into the birds'
natural behaviors of perching,

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
foraging, dust
bathing, socialization.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Cages simply aren't
going to provide that.

It's impossible.

00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%

there was like 20,000 chickens.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And is this a
normal size for you?

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:90%
This barn is 24,000 square feet.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is measured.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's 1.2 square
feet per bird inside.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:84%
There's 22 square
feet of pasture.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
There's six inches
of perch space.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Can they be really happy
because there are so much

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:90%
in the same place?

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So a really good
indication of happiness is,

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%
if you walked into a cage barn,
you would see a lot of anxiety.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Even in a cage-free barn,
they would typically run away.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I can walk
up to the birds and they

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
stay and they're curious, and
the fact that I can do that,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:90%
that is a sign of happiness.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
That tells you
how calm they are.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.540 align:middle line:84%
They're not afraid of people
because they've been allowed

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:90%
to engage in natural behavior.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So they have the
room to move around.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.748 align:middle line:90%
This is a choice they're making.

00:28:07.748 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:84%
If they want to,
they can go outside.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's stopping them.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, she's not running away.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Birds don't
like to be petted.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.210 align:middle line:84%
They like to be stroked
underneath their chin.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The center of the building
is a row of nests.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:90%
That nest is like a big box.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.640 align:middle line:84%
After the bird lays the egg,
it's on a little bit of a roll,

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and that will roll
onto a big egg

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.557 align:middle line:84%
belt underneath that will go
to the front of the building.

00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:50.865 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.865 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So you look at all the
girls that are following us.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
going to a gym.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So if they get a chance
to work out every day,

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.575 align:middle line:84%
not only are their
muscles stronger,

00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
it builds up their
immune system,

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
it builds up their
circulatory system, their lung

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and oxygenation.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing that by
allowing them to have activity.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:84%
When you confine
the animal, it's

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:84%
no different than if you sit
on the sofa and watch TV.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
What we've found is, every
time we improve welfare,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I found my production went
up, my mortality went down.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Good things happened
with the birds.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And we did it initially
because it was a belief,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
but the belief was proven to
be accurate by the productivity

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.790 align:middle line:90%
of the animal.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.865 align:middle line:84%
So we can blend, scale, and
size with animal welfare.

00:29:40.865 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:90%

Hatcheries, of

whether you're getting a male
or a female upon hatching.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:84%
They employ very highly

And what these chicken sexers
do, of course, if it's a hen,

they will put it
in the keep box.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a male,
usually these males

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.340 align:middle line:84%

industrialization has also

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:90%
had a considerable impact.

thrown back into the sea.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:84%
At least 10 million
tons of marine animals

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:84%
are killed each year as bycatch,
including turtles, dolphins,

animals were killed

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:90%
so that you could eat it.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:84%

of prawns from Indonesia,

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
12 kilograms of other
marine animals were killed.

In order to eat tuna
sushi, you should

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:84%

Because of overcrowding and
the poor quality of the water,

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:84%
the mortality rates of
the fish can reach 30%.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But above all, to
feed the farmed fish,

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.400 align:middle line:90%
we have to fish even more.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It takes 2 to 5 kilograms
of wild fish processed

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:84%
into bone meal to feed 1
kilogram of farmed fish.

it's a different quality.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Much more quantity and
a different quality

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:40.880 align:middle line:84%
because there is more organic

the cows are also

And now think, the other

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.640 align:middle line:90%
that it's based on cereals.

more ethical decisions with

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
the meat that we eat, of course,
one possibility is choosing

meat from more sustainable

much less meat.
