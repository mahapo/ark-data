00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Many psychologists feel
that the reason we are seeing

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.340 align:middle line:10%
an exodus of children leaving
our educational systems is

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.600 align:middle line:10%
because our teaching models
are not progressing enough with

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:10%
a new emerging consciousness
of our new generation.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to
tell us something new,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and we are forcing them to
go against their nature.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it all comes
down to evolution.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I don't know
why we think that,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
just because we're here right
now, that evolution is not

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.959 align:middle line:10%
continuing.

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a follow-up book
where I'm talking about,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:10%
I feel like we are living
evolution right now.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Every time we choose
a higher path,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
every time we think of a thought
that's of a higher frequency,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I really believe we're
shifting our DNA.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this,
it's logical--

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
if we've been evolving over
many, many thousands of years,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
which we are still
determining exactly how

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
many thousands of years
we've actually been here,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:90%
that's always up for debate--

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
but that the children who are
being born right now, naturally

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:84%
are going to be more
intelligent than we are.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that just
totally makes sense.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:10%
And so we have a
real crisis now,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:10%
as I know I don't
have to tell you that,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:10%
in the educational
system of this country.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:10%
I've done a lot of work in
neurolinguistic programming,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of that
work involves being

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:10%
able to read people, as
far as their primary mode,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:10%
and the primary ways
that they learn.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.856 align:middle line:84%
People learn one of three
ways-- you're either visual,

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
you're auditory,
you're hearing things,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:84%
or you're more of a
touchy feely person.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
the Indigo children

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:84%
are the special children that
are being born right now--

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:90%
they're more highly evolved.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.617 align:middle line:84%
They're also more
highly sensitive.

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:10%
These are the kids that
would be in school--

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:10%
they're looking down and
they're doodling on the paper.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:10%
And historically, I mean,
I sat in classrooms--

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:10%
I had a history
teacher in high school,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:10%
took his big ruler and
whap to the guy in front

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:10%
of me who's taking a nap.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, children can't
learn unless they

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
go into an alpha
state, a trance state.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And people, a kinesthetic
learner-- a touchy feely

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
learner, which I believe
most of these children are,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
these people, in order to
access that part of their brain,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
their eyes have to go
down and to their right.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they're sitting over
here in class going, la, la, la.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But what the teacher
doesn't understand,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and what the educational system
needs to become aware of,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they are
hearing every single thing

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
you're saying, because their
brain wave has slowed down

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:90%
into the alpha level.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So everything that that teacher
is saying to them is going in,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
but they can't
raise their eyes up,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
because now this is
the auditory level,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and this is the visual level.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:90%
So they need to be there.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And just because
we don't understand

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
how to work with these
children, does not

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.157 align:middle line:84%
mean that we need to be
medicating them, and singling

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
them out, and treating them as
if something's wrong with them.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's going
to cause a major--

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
we need a major overhaul
in the educational system

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies at major universities
in human psychology have found

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that the process of learning
can be accelerated when students

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
move beyond linear sequential
understanding to learning

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and more of a three-dimensional
visual presentation.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way,
the study of physics

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:84%
evolved from the ancient Greek
models of visual mathematics

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and geometry, to linear
sequential mathematical

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:90%
formulas.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Today's students
accelerate their learning

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
much more rapidly in 3D
video game environments.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:84%
What if we were to
develop learning tools

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that simulated the 3D
video game environment,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
but instead of
war games, we were

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
teaching literature, history,
science, math, and even art?

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Would we see a lower
dropout rate in our schools?

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
More creativity, and a greater
enthusiasm about learning?

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The difference between
holographic awareness,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:10%
and linear sequential thinking--

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:10%
we're beginning to realize more
and more that when we first

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:10%
come in here as newborn
babies, because our whole body,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:10%
our whole nervous system
is connected together

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:10%
into a single unit, and
every single pore and morph

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:10%
in our body is
picking up information

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:10%
about the world around us,
than our nervous system builds

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:10%
a hologram, a whole picture
of awareness, simultaneously,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:10%
instantaneously, in the moment.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
In this hologram
for babies, includes

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.900 align:middle line:84%
them not feeling separate
from their environment.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Not separate from their
parents, not separate

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
from their crib, the room
that they're living in--

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.880 align:middle line:84%
they feel, in a sense, a
non-dualism and at one-ment

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.203 align:middle line:90%
with their whole environment.

00:04:52.203 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that children
have the power to enter

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
the conscious field of
the universe more easily,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and more readily than
full-grown adults?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Russian and European physicists
have conducted studies

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
into a force called
torsion that may

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
help explain the creative
and psychic forces

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:90%
of the conscious universe.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Torsion may become a new
identified force in physics

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that can explain what the father
of quantum physics, Max Planck,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:90%
discovered in the early 1900s.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Max Planck believe
that this consciousness

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
was responsible for the
creation of all matter

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:90%
at the subatomic level.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I talk about torsion in
the two chapters in my book,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Life Force.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a relatively new
theory that in the West,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:90%
we don't know much about.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The Russians discovered this
theory about, in the '50s,

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:84%
really, and Kozyrev,
an astrophysicist,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
discovered it by
watching star systems.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
What he concluded
is that whenever

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
there are
electromagnetic fields,

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.774 align:middle line:84%
whenever particles are
flipping their spin--

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:84%
which is the fundamental
way that this torsion

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:90%
field gets created--

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
that it really generates
a new kind of force

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:84%
that Western physics doesn't
understand very well,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
but appears to be
really basic for life.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
From what I've
been looking at, it

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
couples with the bio photons,
which are inside our body,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and all the DNA in
our body generates.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It couples to those, and
it really exists primarily

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:90%
outside the body--

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:90%
it's what makes up the aura.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:90%
It also permeates all of space.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:10%
It can travel both forward
and backward in time,

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:10%
and is really probably in a very
deep sense what keeps particles

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:10%
in place, and defines the
existence of particles,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:10%
and probably their mass.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.666 align:middle line:10%
It might be a
little bit like what

00:06:57.666 --> 00:07:00.170 align:middle line:10%
modern physics calls
the Higgs-Boson,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.081 align:middle line:10%
but it behaves differently.

00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:10%
The Russians know quite
a bit about this--

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:10%
they have equations, they have
theories, they have patents,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:10%
they have devices that
make use of this force.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's important because
the aura outside our body,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
which is made up of
this field, governs

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what goes
on in the body--

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
the health, the well-being, it
governs how we send thoughts,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
most likely, over long distances
with ESP, and things like that.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It governs how healers are
able to project their healing

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:90%
energy over long distances.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very important field.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
The most basic
effect that it has

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
for the present discussion,
of people disappearing

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and teleporting, and
things like that,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
is that this force
appears to be generated

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
at the very smallest scales
of motion of particles,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
as they zigzag back and forth
interacting with the vacuum

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It's this torsion
wave energy that's

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
probably the most important
force that's operating.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:90%
So if you talk about--

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Einstein talked about
gravity, in terms

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
of how the space bends, the
idea of curvature of space as

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:90%
defined in gravity.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
What the torsion
adds is the concept

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:90%
that space can also twist--

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that's why it's
called a torsion.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And probably the very
matrix of reality,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
what we call space time, or
physicists call it the metric--

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
which tells us how space
time has been curved--

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
is really defined
by this energy.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So although we have it
surrounding our bodies,

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and we generate it with
our minds, that gives us

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:84%
a way of affecting the
nature of space time--

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
we can affect it directly
through these torsion fields.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really
fundamental force that's

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.837 align:middle line:90%
pretty much a new discovery.

00:08:58.837 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:10%
>> In the book, The
GOD Experiments,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:10%
where G-O-D stands for guiding,
organizing, designing process,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:10%
I review a series of different
kinds of experiments that,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:10%
together, all point to the
conclusion that there is some

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:10%
sort of a higher universal
intelligence that's expressed

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:10%
in everything, in all things,
that any of us can tap

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:10%
into if we are open to doing
so, and with the appropriate

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:10%
intentions.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
idea of the all is

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
in the small, that general
principle, literally the word

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:90%
small has the word all in it.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, to the extent that there
is this universal intelligence,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
this creative process,
that is, if you would,

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
holographic that exists in
the quantum field, zero point

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:84%
energy field, as
physicists sometimes

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
like to think of it,
then to the extent

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that we seek information, which
we can do inside ourselves,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
we should be able to get, to
various degrees, information.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
we can get information

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:90%
that we can validate-- i.e.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:84%
it actually applies
to the real world.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of observations

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
about what are called
precognitive dreams, dreams

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:84%
about seeing the
future, or having

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:84%
either daydreams or conscious
awareness of things that might

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
happen in the future, including
intuitions and hunches, come

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:84%
from, in part, tapping into
this what Catherine Young calls

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:90%
the knowing field.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And that this is an area
that is like oxygen--

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:90%
it's available to all of us.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Or light, if we're willing
to breathe it in, or go out

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%
into the sun.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> If creativity comes out
of the relationship between

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:84%
the mind interfacing with super
giant fields of consciousness,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be wise to teach
mind expansion techniques?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:84%
If we introduce mind-expanding
concentration and meditation

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:84%
techniques to children, high
school, university students,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and at places of business,
would we see more creativity?

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Increased ability to problem
solve, and greater inventions

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:90%
for our civilization?

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Are today's students
demanding a new way

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
of expanding their
horizons, while we

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
are trying to make them
fit into a model that

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work anymore?

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So to carry this
understanding of the hologram

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
a little bit further, now
picture that your awareness

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
system has become so open that
you are picking up information

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
not only from your
whole body internally,

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:84%
but you're picking up
information from all four

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:84%
directions, all around
you simultaneously,

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And your awareness system
is building a hologram.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So as that hologram
becomes more powerful,

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:84%
as you understand
that way of being

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:84%
aware in the present,
what happens is,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
you start to develop a
non-separateness between you

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and a huge informational
field which surrounds you.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And so your body of knowledge
starts to, in a sense,

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:10%
interact with the body of
differentiation in the world

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:10%
all around you.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
You start to pick up
informational bytes, like

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
at quantum speed, instead
of this linear sequential,

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure it out way.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So you're picking up
all of these bytes.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that this field,
as your awareness field

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
grows, as your
hologram grows, you

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
start to connect with
the giant hologram.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
By the giant
hologram, let's even

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:90%
start out with planet Earth--

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:84%
imagine that planet
Earth, which we saw,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
when they looked
at planet Earth,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
those famous shots of planet
Earth from the spaceship

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
travels, and you see
that, oh, my god, planet

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Earth is a hologram--
it's not divided

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:90%
into sections, and countries.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a whole field.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So picture that you start
to pick up information

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
about the whole field of
your planet Earth, just

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
like, in a sense, that the
web does, the worldwide web.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
We can communicate with people
from everywhere on the planet

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously now.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And so this field of
all this information,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
as you open your
own hologram, begins

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the larger
hologram of information that's

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:90%
available on the planet.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And it even gets bigger
than that-- you start to go,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
my goodness, planet Earth
is within a solar system,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
it has other planets,
it has the sun.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the sun,
in a lot of ways,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is what makes planet
Earth hum the way it does,

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and able to vibrate
with the lifeforms

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:90%
that we, ourselves, are.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And you start to become
much more in tune with that.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
you gain access,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
as you expand your
own hologram, you

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.010 align:middle line:84%
begin to gain access to
wider and wider and wider

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
fields of information,
which begin

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to come through the quantum
processor that you are.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And we already know, in
modern psychophysiology,

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that there are probable--
your brain, in itself,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is capable of containing
as many bits of information

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
as there are grains of
sand on planet Earth.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And imagine you start
to encourage your brain

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:84%
to fire holistically into all
hemispheres simultaneously--

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
left, right, frontal cortex,
and the visual cortex.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So now that the whole
brain is beginning

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:84%
to fire like that, into
those billions of bits

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
of information, and is
able to fire simultaneously

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:84%
interconnectively into all
of those bits of information,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and pull them together into
a holographic vision, that's

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.700 align:middle line:84%
what starts to happen as
you learn to holograph,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
you become a
visionary, you start

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
to see things, you start to see
solutions in your mind's eye,

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to trying
to figure things out.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is when we
really start to generate--

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
we know, in the modern
study of genius,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.740 align:middle line:84%
that the greatest
breakthroughs seem

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to happen exactly
when a person is

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of a restful,
whole-being, open state,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.465 align:middle line:84%
and the brain suddenly
explodes with a huge insight.

00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The famous example is
that, in one instant,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Einstein saw the whole
theory of relativity,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and it took him two and
a half to three years

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:90%
to try to explain--

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
linearly, sequentially,
rationally, logically, what he

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:90%
saw in an instant.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I see, as we understand

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
holographic solution
formation, is that we're

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%
going to create the next
generation of computers,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
we already know, are going to
be called quantum computers.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be able
to fire like our brains do,

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
instead of down
either or choices,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be able
to fire simultaneously

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in all directions,
simultaneously.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So on your computer screen,
you're going to see a hologram,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.830 align:middle line:84%
like you're going to
see a whole person,

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.810 align:middle line:90%
from all sides and all angles.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
be able to rotate

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:90%
that person with your cursor.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
be able to manipulate

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:84%
some object, in
three dimensions,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
make changes to it,
adjustments, as a hologram,

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
instead of having to go through
a whole linear sequential,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.482 align:middle line:84%
cut and paste, shift to
change, in two dimensions,

00:17:17.482 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
going to be looking

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:90%
at imagery in three dimensions.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
able to create solutions

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:90%
in three dimensions.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what our visionary
brain, our whole brain,

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
is able to do, and that's what
our kids are beginning to grok,

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.990 align:middle line:84%
like never before in the
history of the planet.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for us to catch
up, and really understand

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%
where they want to lead us.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Where does
creativity come from?

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:84%
How do we expand
our consciousness,

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
so that we can invent solutions
that have never existed before?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:84%
If we expand our awareness
through meditation

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and concentration, and reach
higher and higher levels

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
of the conscious
universe with our minds,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:84%
can we communicate with the
supreme intelligence that can

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:90%
really teach us how to evolve?

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it even possible
to learn from anything

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
other than what we can perceive
with the five physical senses?

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> All of us have this
unlimited potential within us.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:10%
Even the scientists say we
only use a very small portion

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:10%
of our brain.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:10%
And if you believe in
a spiritual reality,

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:10%
then you have access
to all information

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:10%
within the universe.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
To tap into these
unlimited possibilities,

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you have to
do is believe that you can.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you
can't, you will not,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and you will never be able
to tap into these qualities.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Our research is pointing to
at least two areas where people

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:90%
are getting information from.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:10%
One is, if you would directly--

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:10%
picking up energy
from the environment,

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.860 align:middle line:10%
from living systems, from
other people, from plants--

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:10%
literally detecting
what's here directly.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But there's a second
level, and this

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is where the really psychic,
certainly young adults

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and adults showed this, is
that they report receiving it

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
from their quote, higher
guides, from, if you would,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual realm.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we're now
actually investigating,

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:10%
the testing, the quote,
guide hypothesis,

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:10%
to see whether or
not there is evidence

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:10%
that this is a mechanism
in the same way

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:10%
that we've done
research documenting,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:10%
the mediums can actually
receive communication

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:10%
from individuals who have died.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:10%
So there seems to be
at least two sources

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.796 align:middle line:10%
of the information-- directly
in the physical environment,

00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:10%
and indirectly, if you would,
to a larger spiritual reality.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And my hunch is we're going
to find that both sources are

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:90%
where it comes from.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> If you believe you can
tap into these possibilities,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:90%
that's a first step.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:10%
You absolutely have to
have the belief system,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.752 align:middle line:10%
or else you will never
be able to tap into them.

00:20:18.752 --> 00:20:21.210 align:middle line:10%
The second thing you want to
do is ask the right questions.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.626 align:middle line:10%
Because a question
to the universe

00:20:22.626 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:10%
will always bring
about an answer.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask yourself,
how can I become an artist?

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:84%
You will, within a
week, have an answer.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The first step will
be provided to you.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.513 align:middle line:84%
For example, you may meet
someone who's an artist,

00:20:34.513 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
you may meet someone who points
you towards an art class,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you may have an inspiration
to walk in the craft store

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and pick up some paints.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.742 align:middle line:90%
If you ask, how can I heal?

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start receiving
the answers, and the hopes,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and the inspirations
from the heavens.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So you must believe in it,
and you must absolutely

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:90%
ask the right questions.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:10%
>> If we picture everything
that humanity currently knows,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:10%
and visualize it
inside of a cube,

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:10%
and we realize that our
education is limited

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:10%
to the inside of the cube, how
can we find the solutions we

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:10%
seek, remaining inside
the laws of the cube?

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
If we have to expand our
vision beyond the cube,

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
to learn that which has
not yet been discovered,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and we keep creating limitations
in our laws of science,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
laws of physics, laws of
government, laws of banking,

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
laws of education,
laws of religion,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.684 align:middle line:90%
how will we ever evolve?

00:21:31.684 --> 00:21:34.100 align:middle line:10%
>> There is an unprecedented
amount of children being born

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:10%
on this planet with a
high-functioning intuition--

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:10%
children who remember previous
lifetimes, and children

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:10%
that recall being
here before, children

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:10%
who see their aunts and
uncles who have passed on.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
we're evolving.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
The word apocalypse means, it's
French, for releasing the veil,

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:90%
or removing the veil.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And these children
are very sensitive.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:10%
And if you notice that these
children have very large eyes,

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:10%
their eyes are very
oval, and they're

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:10%
being born all over the
planet, all over the world--

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.097 align:middle line:10%
places like China, and Japan.

00:22:06.097 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:10%
And we're seeing this
because it's a natural state

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:10%
of evolution of the planet.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:10%
Our conscious is evolutioning.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.979 align:middle line:10%
And the point is that
we have become so busy

00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:10%
that we're not seeing it.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:10%
We have these gifted
and amazing children

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:10%
who are here to help us,
as Turnbull Melchizedek

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.432 align:middle line:10%
has said many times, that
children will show us the way.

00:22:23.432 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:10%
This is what they're
doing-- they're showing us

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:10%
the natural state
of being, they're

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:10%
showing us our abilities
that we've long

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:10%
forgotten, our
abilities that we've

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:10%
tuned out due to pressures from
growing up and being adults.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:10%
And this is why they're
here, they're here now.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:10%
And this is why we
created this conference

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:10%
to help them and
support their families.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so what is going
on is the return of the inner

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:90%
child.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, even
the Bible says how,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:10%
only one who possesses
a heart of a child

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:10%
may enter the Kingdom of God.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:10%
And this is happening
with a lot of adults--

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:10%
they're bringing forth
their inner child,

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:10%
and also our children are born
able to keep their innocence

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:09.440 align:middle line:10%
and wisdom intact to inspire
and bring us forward.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.624 align:middle line:84%
And also it says, only a
child will lead the way.

00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's also where
we're at right now

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and what we're witnessing.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It's really neat, because we
all are really just light,

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and we mirror the stars in that,
we are light in dark places.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time, we've had
masculine energy ruling things,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:90%
calling the shots.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And now we have the
feminine energy returning.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's really not about the
masculine or the feminine as

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:84%
one over the other, it's really
about the balance of the two

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:84%
within us, which brings
about the inner child.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like how
we call our children

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.610 align:middle line:90%
our sunshine, our light.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the more we
shine our light,

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:84%
the more we will be emulating
and mirroring the stars.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And particularly when all
these lights come together

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
in one area, it will
look like one big light,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:84%
like one giant
sun spelled S-U-N,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.372 align:middle line:84%
or S-O-N, the return of
God's son, androgynous.

00:24:13.372 --> 00:24:16.372 align:middle line:84%
It's really beautiful
and an exciting time.

00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And you look at some of
these young artists today,

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
like Akihyon, and you're seeing
children who are claiming

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to have dialogues
with God and angels.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're putting it
on canvas, and you think,

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
are we are we able
to accept this?

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Do we know how to
accept that children

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.380 align:middle line:84%
are dialoguing with beings
from beyond this world?

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we can accept that,
and we're not just saying,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is just myth, or this
is just children's fantasy

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
land, then maybe we can
start asking questions

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
to beckon the
solutions that we're

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:90%
looking for on the planet.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.782 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked a few of
these kids these questions.

00:24:54.782 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, where are you
getting your information?

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a big part of
it, is how does a child come

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
into this world at
age four or five,

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:84%
the parents have no
structure or belief

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:84%
system around a religion,
and they're not artists.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So how does a child
come into this world,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:84%
just pick up the
palette, know the colors,

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and how to mix the colors to
make the flesh tones, and all

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.330 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:90%
like Akhiyon, for instance.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:90%
How do they have this knowledge?

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Where does that
wisdom come from?

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people would say they're
reincarnate of perhaps Leonardo

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
da Vinci, or someone
might say that they're

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:90%
channeling this information.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The kids oftentimes don't
know, they just do it.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't even think,
they don't hesitate.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the kind
of a new generation,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:84%
this wave of children that are
coming into this world that

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:90%
just are totally aware.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:90%
They just remember.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody
actually can probably

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.400 align:middle line:84%
do what these kids are doing,
if we just simply think out

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of the box, and we open
ourselves up to realize

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.787 align:middle line:90%
the true essence of our being.

00:25:55.787 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, what's amazing at
this point in history is we

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.782 align:middle line:84%
have the potential to super
merge at a level of exponential

00:26:02.782 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:84%
increase that we've never seen
in the history of the world.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.830 align:middle line:10%
We have the internet.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.949 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to
search online on Google.

00:26:09.949 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Google is the largest
number ever counted--

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.850 align:middle line:90%
that's what Google means.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like the brain
of the universe.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
You can search in any
library, any manuscript,

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:84%
any mathematical formula,
any medical formula, anything

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.157 align:middle line:90%
you want is online.

00:26:23.157 --> 00:26:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And we've never had this before.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you had to
go to the library

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
before, and know a
book by certain author,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and look it up in the catalog,
and then go check it out,

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and then come home and read it.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Now this information is
right at our fingertips.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think this new generation
is not only our greatest hope,

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
if we can open some
doors in places

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:90%
we've never seen it before.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But their ability to
go far beyond anybody

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the world is
unprecedented-- if we allow it.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:90%
If we allow it.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And there is no way we're going
to make it, unless we just

00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:90%
turn right or turn left.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to do something
radically different.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And can you imagine
these children,

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:84%
with all this information,
just imagine there are

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of thousands of them.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And actually what's
happening is an evolution

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.680 align:middle line:84%
of our species on a
level of consciousness.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, we talk about
technology, and yes, we're

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:90%
in the information age.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Computers, within
a nanosecond, you

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:84%
can talk to somebody
around the world.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Everything is moving faster
and faster and faster now.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So with that given, that
any time one of these kids

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
gets on a computer and
shares information,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
think how it's
being disseminated

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:84%
amongst the populations
of the entire planet

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:90%
quickly, in just a nanosecond.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very powerful
tool, is our internet,

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:84%
as far as information stream,
or the network that gets out

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:84%
there, is their knowledge is
being shared with the many

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:90%
rather than the few that way.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> How can we tell our children
that there is no money to build

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:90%
their new world with?

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:59.257 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.257 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, we look at, what are
our big problems in the world

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest problems
we have is the economy.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
amazing statistic,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
because we have more
genius in the planet today

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
than we've ever had in
the history of the world.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, according to
Mensa and IQ testing,

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
there's at least 125 million
people on the planet,

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
out of over 6 billion people,
who are at the genius level.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
If we were to mobilize
125 million geniuses,

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and give them funding to do
anything they wanted to solve

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84%
the world's problems, from
new fossil fuels to zero-point

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
energy, new sources of
energy, safe nuclear energy,

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravity, going to
the stars and beyond,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:84%
solving the next biological
crisis, solving--

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, virtually everything
that is a limitation

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:90%
that we can see right now.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:84%
When you look at that,
the idea that, OK,

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:84%
we have more wealth in
services and knowledge

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:84%
than we've ever had, yet
our economy is saying,

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:90%
there's no money.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:90%
But what is money?

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Money is a note that's supposed
to move goods and services.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no shortage
of goods and services,

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:84%
we actually grow enough food
to feed the world three times

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
over, and we let literally
billions of tons of food rot

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.340 align:middle line:84%
every year in the United States,
that we're not delivering.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So the problem
isn't that we don't

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:90%
have enough food and resources.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that we don't
have enough timber, and rock,

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and steel to make houses with.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We have 10% unemployed in
the United States, alone.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So you think of,
why aren't we moving

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:90%
our goods and our resources?

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And even more importantly,
is why aren't we

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:90%
paying people to think?

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of
the number of ideas

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:84%
that people have every
day, an invention.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.601 align:middle line:84%
Something that could solve
this problem or that problem.

00:29:53.601 --> 00:29:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to the bank,
they say, well, we're

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
not going to give you money
to fund your crazy idea, that

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:90%
would be crazy.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Because there's only
a little bit of money.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But we've bought into
this mechanism that

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.200 align:middle line:84%
says that money is what rules
the planet, when actually it's

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.320 align:middle line:84%
what money represents--
which is goods and services

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and inventions, and
thinking and knowledge.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.045 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of attacking
the Federal Reserve,

00:30:18.045 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
or the central
banks of the world

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:90%
is now very popular in Congress.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Senator John Kerry, and
representative Ron Paul,

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.650 align:middle line:84%
want to audit the
Federal Reserve.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
This was recently on
MSNBC, and basically

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:84%
take them to court for robbing
the war and hijacking us.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:84%
They are saying,
there's so much debt,

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.380 align:middle line:84%
we owe them so much money,
that we can't move forward.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
That there is so much debt
that we can't move forward

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:90%
with our economy.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.280 align:middle line:84%
When there's
actually more genius,

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.266 align:middle line:84%
and there's more resources,
and more goods than

00:30:47.266 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:84%
ever in the history
of the world.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:90%
We have to get beyond money.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's going
to be an iconoclasm

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:90%
to just get beyond money.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Something that if we don't
do it, so we don't do this,

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.877 align:middle line:84%
what they're saying is
the debt is so huge,

00:31:01.877 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
they say, sorry, you
can't do anything

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:84%
because you owe
us all this money,

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and all the food
is going to rot,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.449 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
build a build a house,

00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:90%
yet the materials are there.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to do anything
until you pay us this money.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get beyond
the concept of money.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:27.480 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>> When you start
to understand that,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.300 align:middle line:84%
as our field of awareness grows,
what we do is we connect with

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.980 align:middle line:90%
the infinite field.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We connect with the
infinite quantum

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:90%
field, which is endless.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:10%
In fact, what we're discovering,
and thanks to David's genius,

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.720 align:middle line:10%
we're discovering that it's
the way that the electron spins

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:10%
in a condenser of ever
smaller direction,

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.370 align:middle line:10%
into minuscule micro
matter, or micro energy.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The positron spins in
the opposite direction,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and keeps expanding to
infinity and beyond.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:84%
His theory, for the first
time, explains to us

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:90%
why the universe is expanding.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Why planet Earth is getting
slightly bigger every year.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Why the moon is getting bigger.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Why human beings get bigger.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Because in a sense,
it's like source,

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:84%
it's like the infinite source
quantum energy mystery field,

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
out of which
everything manifests.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Said, you know what?

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:90%
The field isn't closed.

You just have to be willing
to make that creative leap

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%

>> Imagine for a moment,
if a hurricane was coming

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But now, as people, instead
of what we're doing with

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:84%
the weather forecasts-- which
is we're amplifying the fear,

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and looking at all the
blowing of the winds and all

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:90%
the torments, and so on--

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.040 align:middle line:84%
imagine it said, we had
millions, or billions

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:18.969 align:middle line:84%
of people simultaneously engaged
in an organized, synchronized,

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
guided imagery over the media
of sending loving intentions,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and calming
intentions to a storm.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.969 align:middle line:84%
Or even with redirecting
it to a safer environment.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:33.219 align:middle line:84%
Would we find that the
storm was diminished?

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Would we find that the
storm might be moved?

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.676 align:middle line:84%
Well we'll never discover
it, unless we look for it.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2006, Professor Gary
Schwartz proposed that

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:56.650 align:middle line:10%
the power of global
consciousness just might be

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:10%
able to steer hurricanes
away from the Gulf of Mexico.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.750 align:middle line:84%
That is because scientists
have proven the mind's ability

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to effect change in the
structure and pH of water

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.140 align:middle line:90%
over any distance.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:84%
As hurricanes are made
of water and wind,

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.000 align:middle line:84%
the theory holds true that mass
consciousness could possibly

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
redirect hurricanes,
even if those minds are

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:90%
at a great distance removed.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, three
hurricanes moved right

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:84%
through the Gulf
of Mexico, causing

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:84%
billions of dollars in damage,
and claiming hundreds of lives.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:52.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:84%
In 2010, after
the Gulf oil spill

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.410 align:middle line:84%
released over 300 million
gallons of crude oil,

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.770 align:middle line:84%
the greatest fears of
hurricanes emerged.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.930 align:middle line:84%
If a category three
or four hurricane

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.190 align:middle line:84%
entered the Gulf of Mexico,
with maximum sustained winds,

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.800 align:middle line:84%
the millions of gallons
of oil would quickly

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
stir into a frenzy, causing
serious extensive damage.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:10%
As the 2010 Gulf hurricane
season beckoned the world,

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:24.480 align:middle line:10%
millions of meditators
assembled consciousness groups

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:10%
worldwide through the internet,
and live in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:10%
to protect the region
from powerful hurricanes.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.810 align:middle line:84%
The meditations and intentions
of millions of minds,

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:84%
focusing like a
powerful giant lens,

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to protect the Gulf waters
were very, very powerful.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:10%
Miraculously, not one of
the 2010 category three

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:55.130 align:middle line:10%
or higher hurricanes made
it into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as Hurricane Irma tried
to approach the Gulf on August

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
22, it got turned away
by high pressure winds,

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:90%
as did Hurricane Danielle.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:84%
On September 12th,
Hurricane Igor

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.880 align:middle line:84%
became a category
four hurricane,

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
heading towards
the Gulf of Mexico.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Once again, high pressure
winds pushed it away

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.150 align:middle line:90%
from the entire US coast.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:84%
On September 17th,
Hurricane Karl

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.240 align:middle line:84%
became a category three
hurricane, just skimming

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:84%
the lower Gulf of
Mexico, clear out

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.830 align:middle line:90%
of the way of the oil spill.

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Did the power of
collective consciousness

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:84%
protect the Gulf of Mexico
from hurricanes in 2010?

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Are human minds that powerful?

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.910 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.940 align:middle line:84%
The need to find new
sources of energy

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.670 align:middle line:84%
is paramount to
our very survival.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Solar power and
hydrogen fuel cells

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.960 align:middle line:84%
were used successfully by NASA
during the Gemini and Apollo

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:84%
missions from the
1950s to the 1970s,

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and today in the
space shuttle program.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:84%
While we are led to
believe that solar

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and wind power our best
solutions to sustainable

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.020 align:middle line:84%
energy, there are
hidden discoveries

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:16.420 align:middle line:84%
in zero-point energy that would
make such technology obsolete.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:84%
The future of energy,
transportation, architecture,

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:84%
agriculture, communication,
and human civilization.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Would radically transform
upon the release

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:32.530 align:middle line:84%
of classified zero-point energy
and anti-gravity technology.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Gravity research is
an area of physics

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that has been ignored
more than any other.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is the most
obvious of all the forces,

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:84%
yet it is the least understood,
and the least studied.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
While there are secret
government programs currently

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:84%
doing research
into anti-gravity,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.020 align:middle line:84%
human civilization
has yet to benefit

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.450 align:middle line:90%
from this amazing technology.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:10%
Many eyewitnesses to UFOs,
or anti-gravity flying craft,

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:10%
have been deeply moved
by the experience

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:10%
of seeing spacecraft
defy the currently

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.145 align:middle line:10%
known laws of physics.

00:39:06.145 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Max Planck, the father
of quantum physics,

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.140 align:middle line:90%
is also Einstein's mentor.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
Einstein without him.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Planck proposed the discovery
of zero-point energy in 1912.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.130 align:middle line:84%
If we are really looking
for new energy sources,

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:84%
tapping into zero-point energy
would be the holy grail.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.780 align:middle line:84%
If we could tap into this
inexhaustible energy source,

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:37.400 align:middle line:84%
we would eliminate the need for
burning fossil fuels entirely.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:84%
In 1913, pursuing Max
Planck's discovery further,

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein, and Otto
Stern published a paper

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:84%
revealing the great
significance and existence

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.540 align:middle line:90%
of zero-point energy.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
To this date, the
public is entirely

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.400 align:middle line:84%
unaware of any
government research

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.290 align:middle line:84%
into zero-point energy as a
viable, future energy source.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we using all of
our resources to find it?

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Only the alternative scientists
are pursuing this holy grail.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Does the Bible warn us of an
enormous cosmic transformation

of the solar system,
the Earth, and the sun,

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.690 align:middle line:90%
at the Day of Atonement?

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:84%
In 2 Peter, 3:10-13, "But
the day the Lord will come

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.320 align:middle line:84%
as a thief in the night, in
which the heavens shall pass

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:84%
away with a great noise, and
the elements shall melt with

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:53.280 align:middle line:84%
fervent heat, the earth, also,
and the works that are therein,

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:90%
shall be burned up.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Look for an hasting unto the
coming of the day of God,

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.611 align:middle line:84%
wherein the heavens, being
on fire, shall be dissolved.

00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless we,
according to His promise,

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.260 align:middle line:84%
look for new heavens,
and a new earth."

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Can science explain
this grand cosmic event?

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.950 align:middle line:84%
The orbits of atomic
and subatomic particles

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
behave like tiny planets,
orbiting around stars,

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating a synchronicity
between the micro

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.330 align:middle line:90%
and the macrocosms.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.570 align:middle line:84%
We can see just how the
electrons in an atom

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:84%
travel in orbits
around the nucleus,

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.920 align:middle line:84%
just as planets
travel around our sun.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
If we understand invisible,
but mathematically

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.870 align:middle line:84%
proven dynamics of electrons
on the atomic scale,

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.960 align:middle line:84%
will we be able to
mathematically explain

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.250 align:middle line:84%
unforeseen changes on the
scale of our solar system?

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.410 align:middle line:84%
According to Niels
Bohr's atomic model,

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:08.360 align:middle line:84%
when an electron crosses the
border from an outer, lower

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:84%
frequency shell orbit, and goes
to an inner, higher frequency

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:84%
shell orbit, the electron gives
up some of its mass energy,

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and the electron, in a
sense, becomes lighter.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these
lighter electrons

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:84%
will spin faster than
the speed of light inside

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.200 align:middle line:84%
of the new, higher
frequency shell,

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.980 align:middle line:84%
defying the currently
known laws of physics.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:84%
In particle accelerators,
quantum physicists

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.340 align:middle line:84%
look at photographs of
particle explosions.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:84%
This amazing photo
reveals a hidden secret--

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:middle line:84%
each particle has
been color coded.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Lower frequency orbits are
longer wavelength spirals.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Higher frequency orbits are
smaller wavelength spirals.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> A yellow anti-proton comes
in from the right to left with

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:10.350 align:middle line:84%
a mass of 938 million
electron volts.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So we are starting with a
particle with a lower frequency

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:90%
orbit, and a lot of mass energy.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It then generates a
green positive pion

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:84%
in a higher frequency
orbit, with a lower mass now

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:90%
of 140 million electron volts.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.190 align:middle line:84%
We already see a
huge drop in mass

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:84%
as the particle goes into
a higher frequency mode.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:84%
The green positive
pion transforms

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.470 align:middle line:84%
into an even higher frequency
orbit, generating a red muon

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.790 align:middle line:84%
with a lower mass, again, of
105 million electron volts.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Next, the red muon spins into
a super high frequency orbit,

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and transforms into a blue
positron, positive electron,

00:43:54.260 --> 00:44:00.720 align:middle line:84%
with a super low mass of
0.511 million electron volts.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Lower frequency orbits are
longer wavelength spirals.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Higher frequency orbits are
smaller wavelength spirals.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What this tells us is
that the higher the frequency

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the orbit of the
subatomic particle,

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.950 align:middle line:84%
the lower its mass
energy becomes.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:20.060 align:middle line:84%
In essence, it becomes
lighter, the higher

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.580 align:middle line:90%
its orbital frequency becomes.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we
superimpose this model

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.490 align:middle line:84%
onto the size of the
galaxy, what happens?

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that
Einstein's law says

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.730 align:middle line:84%
the closer we get to a black
hole, the highest frequency

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:84%
domain In the galaxy,
as a planet, the greater

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.960 align:middle line:84%
the mass of the planet in the
presence of the black hole?

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.240 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it is thought
that black holes

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.190 align:middle line:10%
have super giant mass energy,
thus increasing their gravity.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.410 align:middle line:10%
It appears the quantum
model disagrees

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:53.540 align:middle line:10%
with the astrophysical model.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Only one of them can be right.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we cannot actually
travel to a black hole,

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:03.420 align:middle line:84%
we have to rely on the data
we have in front of us,

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.080 align:middle line:84%
which says, the reason black
holes devour whole stars

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and planets with ease is not
because of their increased

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:13.370 align:middle line:84%
gravity, it is because, as
the planets and stars enter

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.500 align:middle line:84%
the higher frequency
domain of the black hole,

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.340 align:middle line:84%
they lose their mass energy, and
do not weigh anything anymore--

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the black hole devours
them with ease.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
This means, as our solar system
spirals around the Milky Way

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.900 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, and slowly enters
into a higher frequency

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:34.340 align:middle line:84%
orbit, our sun, planets,
and bodies are transforming

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.470 align:middle line:90%
into a lighter form of energy.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Hence, the new earth.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:43.040 align:middle line:84%
This transformation is
sudden at certain points,

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.440 align:middle line:84%
just as we see in
the photograph.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The point of the yellow coded
anti-proton losing its mass,

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and transforming
into a green pion,

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.410 align:middle line:90%
is sudden and not gradual.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:84%
When the green pion turns into
a red muon, it is sudden, again.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.990 align:middle line:84%
These transformations take
place in less than a nanosecond.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:06.050 align:middle line:84%
This tells us that when
our solar system crosses

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:08.790 align:middle line:84%
that fateful shell
in the galaxy,

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:84%
the transformation
will be sudden--

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.060 align:middle line:90%
in the twinkling of an eye.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:31.330 align:middle line:84%
In theory, this may be precisely
what happens on a grand scale,

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:35.410 align:middle line:84%
with our own solar system, as
it migrates through the galaxy.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.800 align:middle line:84%
When we spiral from a lower
into a higher frequency

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.490 align:middle line:84%
shell within the galaxy,
and cross the shell line,

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, the sun,
the planets, and the Earth

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.620 align:middle line:84%
will undergo a major,
sudden, transformation.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Does this explain the
meaning of the new heaven

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and the new Earth in
the Book of Revelation?

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth spins at
approximately 1,000 miles

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.110 align:middle line:84%
per hour at the
equator, while the speed

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth around the sun
is approximately 67,000 miles

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.530 align:middle line:90%
per hour.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.870 align:middle line:84%
The orbital velocity
of the solar system

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.450 align:middle line:84%
around the center
of the galaxy is

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:17.350 align:middle line:84%
approximately 137
miles per second,

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:21.040 align:middle line:84%
or nearly 500,000
miles per hour.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:84%
In a 24-hour day, we travel
nearly 12 million miles

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.870 align:middle line:90%
around the Milky Way galaxy.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Our vertical ascension velocity
comes to 370,000 miles per day,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.800 align:middle line:84%
moving north of
the galactic plane.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Both velocities are faster
than any spaceship thus far

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.580 align:middle line:90%
developed has ever traveled.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We are entering new
space every single day

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that no human civilization
has ever ventured into.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers have discovered
that our very own Milky Way

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.250 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, and our nearest
neighboring galaxy, Andromeda--

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:84%
nearly 2.2 million
light years from us--

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:04.600 align:middle line:84%
are being pulled simultaneously
at enormous speed

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.040 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of a super
gravity field of dark matter

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.170 align:middle line:90%
in the constellation of Virgo.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:16.820 align:middle line:84%
What effect will this have on
our microcosmic solar system?

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And even more mysteriously,
our consciousness?

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.720 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the really exciting
discoveries that comes along

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:29.270 align:middle line:10%
with the Russian torsion
science that they've developed,

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.420 align:middle line:10%
is that there are two
types of torsion--

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:10%
a right handed
and a left handed.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They correspond to the Chinese
version of yin and yang,

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.677 align:middle line:84%
because this torsion is
really the same thing as chi,

00:48:38.677 --> 00:48:40.760 align:middle line:84%
it's just that they have
a little more information

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.490 align:middle line:84%
about it, and more hard
science information

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:45.020 align:middle line:90%
about how it behaves.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.229 align:middle line:84%
It's found in
space, and floating

00:48:47.229 --> 00:48:48.770 align:middle line:84%
in the vacuum of
space, and really it

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:52.370 align:middle line:84%
shows up as areas
where the space time is

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:54.740 align:middle line:84%
a little bit different
from what we have come

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.230 align:middle line:90%
to expect from our physics.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So that if you look
out into space,

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.770 align:middle line:84%
you'll find regions where
there's more dark matter--

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:06.080 align:middle line:84%
which is what they would
call a left handed torsion.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.420 align:middle line:10%
And also more of the
other form, which

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.340 align:middle line:10%
is dark energy, which is
what we would call a right

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.627 align:middle line:10%
handed torsion.

00:49:12.627 --> 00:49:14.960 align:middle line:84%
The right handed torsion,
there's a repulsion of matter,

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.150 align:middle line:90%
or reduced gravity.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Left handed torsion is increase
of gravity, more traction.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:26.660 align:middle line:10%
So in Virgo right now, there
is a large concentration

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.590 align:middle line:10%
of dark matter, or the
attractive left handed torsion

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.600 align:middle line:10%
component.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
What Kozyrev, who is the
inventor of this theory,

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.855 align:middle line:84%
talks about is that left
handed torsion increases ESP--

00:49:41.855 --> 00:49:45.710 align:middle line:90%
it improves psychic abilities.

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:48.830 align:middle line:84%
This has been backed up by
some of the magnet healers,

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.320 align:middle line:84%
like Davis and
Rawls, who also show

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that you take the south-pointing
end of the magnet,

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and put it on your
third eye, for example,

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.240 align:middle line:84%
they find that it increases
psychic ability, or ESP.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same type of
energy we're talking about.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, it so happens
there's a time of day

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:15.110 align:middle line:84%
which Spotiswood has discovered
when Virgo is overhead.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:19.090 align:middle line:10%
And when that happens,
psychic reception is better,

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:22.460 align:middle line:10%
and ESP is better, and remote
viewing is more accurate,

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.740 align:middle line:10%
by about a factor
of four, compared

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.210 align:middle line:10%
to the rest of the day.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:30.050 align:middle line:84%
That happens to be the time
when the dark matter in Virgo is

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:33.830 align:middle line:84%
overhead, the Earth is not in
the way--it's not blocking it.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is confirmation
that the dark matter has

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
an effect on ESP, and
our psychic ability.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It has been proposed that there
are great cycles in history--

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.930 align:middle line:84%
we have the golden
ages and the dark ages.

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:56.060 align:middle line:84%
They have been correlated with
about a 26,000-year cycle,

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.720 align:middle line:84%
about the same as a
procession of our pole.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that it's our
motion compared to dark matter

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.180 align:middle line:84%
sources like Virgo,
that determines

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.500 align:middle line:84%
when these effects are
increased or decreased.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So if we happen to be
to pointing right now,

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.050 align:middle line:84%
or moving more
rapidly toward Virgo,

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.100 align:middle line:84%
that might increase the
influence of this dark matter.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.600 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Our solar system has been
charted to be about one third

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:28.040 align:middle line:84%
of the way from the outer rim
of the Milky Way galaxy to its

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.210 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.460 align:middle line:90%
We are ever spiraling inwards.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But we are also spiraling in
another dimension of spin.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.630 align:middle line:10%
In a paper on this study of
the solar system's migration

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:42.980 align:middle line:10%
through the galaxy, physicists
found that every 64 million

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.300 align:middle line:10%
years, our solar system dips
south below the galactic plane,

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:10%
and rises north above
the galactic plane.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:55.190 align:middle line:10%
We are currently moving north
about 10 parsecs of true north,

00:51:55.190 --> 00:52:00.560 align:middle line:10%
or 190 trillion miles of
the precise galactic plane--

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.600 align:middle line:10%
still inside the thickness
of the upper plane.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We are in the same position
that the dinosaurs went extinct

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.100 align:middle line:90%
some 64 million years ago.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.180 align:middle line:84%
This study also found that most
major extinction-level events

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:84%
occurred when the
solar system was moving

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.260 align:middle line:90%
north of the galactic plane.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.840 align:middle line:84%
The further we move
north, the more exposed

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.980 align:middle line:84%
we are to super cosmic rays
from the galactic center.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.080 align:middle line:84%
When we were south, or
inside the galactic plane,

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.210 align:middle line:84%
we are more protected
from this cosmic energy.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.550 align:middle line:84%
When we emerge from the
thickness of the plane,

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:38.330 align:middle line:84%
we will see a sudden
influx of cosmic rays,

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:43.340 align:middle line:84%
thus affecting all life forms,
forcing our DNA to evolve--

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:47.630 align:middle line:84%
or possibly even die
if it does not evolve.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:84%
No human species
has ever existed

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.850 align:middle line:84%
north of the galactic
plane in our ancient past.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:55.510 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's certainly true that
if there is a big solar flare

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that's aimed at the Earth,
coronal mass ejection hits

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:07.740 align:middle line:84%
the Earth for example,
it will affect the Earth.

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It can, for a time,
weaken our magnetic field,

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:84%
or could greatly
weaken it, which

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.920 align:middle line:84%
means that cosmic
rays can rain down

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.220 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth at a much
stronger level than normal.

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.950 align:middle line:10%
And that would cause mutations.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:24.500 align:middle line:10%
One problem is that
there's no guarantee

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.579 align:middle line:10%
they'll be beneficial.

00:53:25.579 --> 00:53:27.120 align:middle line:10%
We'll probably get
a lot of mutations

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.620 align:middle line:10%
that are not beneficial.

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe produce species that are
not viable-- they'll just die.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So you may get a few
people, or a few mutations

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:38.480 align:middle line:90%
that might be beneficial--

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.730 align:middle line:84%
but you'll have a lot of cost
there, in terms of lives.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
other possibility

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.340 align:middle line:84%
is that when large solar
flares like that hit the Earth,

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.960 align:middle line:84%
they induce stresses on
the crust of the Earth.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.850 align:middle line:84%
As they change the
magnetic field,

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:59.420 align:middle line:84%
you may even get a pole reversal
happening because of one

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.652 align:middle line:90%
of these large solar flares.

00:54:01.652 --> 00:54:03.110 align:middle line:84%
If we have that,
we're going to get

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:08.910 align:middle line:84%
huge changes of mass, of the
land masses, and earthquakes,

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and volcanoes, maybe even
a shift of the orientation

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.120 align:middle line:90%
of the poles, themselves.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of loss of
life would happen,

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.030 align:middle line:84%
if you have a direct hit
by a coronal mass ejection.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may end up
leading to a new age where

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:26.690 align:middle line:84%
those who get through it
may lead to a golden age,

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:28.190 align:middle line:90%
but it's a hard way to do it.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not a very gentle
thing to go through.

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:39.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, the idea of the
torsion field in both in Virgo,

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and other sources of
torsion, is more benign,

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.780 align:middle line:84%
because we know there that
increase of this field

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.240 align:middle line:84%
will definitely lead
to increased intuition,

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and you have a better ability
to have ideas, to have insights,

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.300 align:middle line:84%
to tap into the akashic
record, that would be improved.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So access to the torsion
field on an increased basis

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:07.270 align:middle line:84%
would be a more promising way
to do it, if I had my choice.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:11.170 align:middle line:84%
One more thing on
this whole subject,

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:16.150 align:middle line:84%
we do see right now
indicators in the solar system

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that we are moving into a region
where the background of space

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.440 align:middle line:90%
is different than it was before.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:29.200 align:middle line:84%
The planet, such as Mars,
the whitecaps, the snow caps,

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.560 align:middle line:84%
are disappearing from places
throughout the solar system--

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.400 align:middle line:84%
which means that the planets are
heating up, not just the Earth,

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.440 align:middle line:90%
but other places, as well.

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The output of the sun has
not changed, measurably.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So the best explanation
for these effects

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.770 align:middle line:84%
is that the torsion background
that our solar system is moving

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:51.310 align:middle line:84%
through is changing, as though
we were moving through a region

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:55.526 align:middle line:84%
where the background left
handed torsion is increased.

00:55:55.526 --> 00:55:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
that would explain

00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:00.910 align:middle line:84%
why there might be
an increase in ESP

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:03.250 align:middle line:90%
and intuition on the Earth.

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And you'll also see physical
effects, such as these warming

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:07.720 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Because all the
physical processes

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.889 align:middle line:84%
that we take for granted,
that we have constants

00:56:13.889 --> 00:56:15.430 align:middle line:84%
we've measured over
hundreds of years

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:17.800 align:middle line:84%
in our scientific
laboratories, we're

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.110 align:middle line:84%
going to see some of
those perhaps changing

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:23.530 align:middle line:84%
as we move into a different
background of torsion.

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> As Einstein has proven, the
field is the sole governing

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.035 align:middle line:84%
agency of the
particle of matter.

00:56:29.035 --> 00:56:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It is the fields of energy
that our sun and planets

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:36.400 align:middle line:84%
encounter that brings
change to the solar system.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Just as electrons
encounter change

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.320 align:middle line:84%
when they encounter
different fields of energy

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.730 align:middle line:90%
within the atom.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Because our solar
system is moving

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:84%
into new fields of
energy every single day,

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.430 align:middle line:84%
no one can predict how those
fields may affect our sun

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and planet Earth.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.800 align:middle line:84%
If our solar system crosses a
major membrane in the galaxy,

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.920 align:middle line:84%
just as electrons do
when they jump shells,

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.060 align:middle line:84%
the sun and planets may undergo
a major sudden transformation,

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.280 align:middle line:90%
just as electrons do.

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.950 align:middle line:84%
This transformation
may be what the Bible's

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.890 align:middle line:90%
2 Peter is referring to.

00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:15.310 align:middle line:84%
"Wherein the heavens being
on fire shall be dissolved,

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat."

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears from everything
going on that we are speeding

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:26.860 align:middle line:84%
up, that knowledge is speeding
up, insights are speeding up,

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.740 align:middle line:84%
technology and science
is speeding up.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So things that seemed
impossible even 10 years ago,

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:37.810 align:middle line:84%
such as this torsion
science that's

00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:40.570 align:middle line:84%
coming out of Russia,
which actually, then,

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:45.250 align:middle line:84%
has implications for
how you can levitate

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and teleport things like that--

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.190 align:middle line:84%
some of these discoveries
that the psychic children that

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:54.790 align:middle line:84%
are showing up, the crystals,
and all the other types

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of children, that
are appearing, that

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.070 align:middle line:84%
are just very wise,
and much more advanced,

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.660 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their intuitive
abilities than most of us.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:09.160 align:middle line:10%
The types of information that
we're getting from many sources

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:14.860 align:middle line:10%
just tell me that the
evolution of the planet

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.040 align:middle line:10%
is really growing exponentially.

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.010 align:middle line:10%
At the same time, there are
all these more dark forces

00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:23.620 align:middle line:10%
and pessimistic forces,
and violent forces

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:28.100 align:middle line:10%
that are also present, so it's
a tug of war between these two.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:32.520 align:middle line:10%
And if you just look rationally
at all the forces in play,

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.520 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to know what's
really going to happen,

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:40.790 align:middle line:10%
how we're going to evolve
into a golden age with all

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:44.820 align:middle line:10%
these other dark and warring and
war-like forces still present.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of a
splitting universe,

00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of a split or a
shift, where there

00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:53.420 align:middle line:84%
is some change of dimension
between these two groups,

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.240 align:middle line:84%
would certainly be
a nice clean way

00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.620 align:middle line:90%
to resolve the contradiction.

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Either that, or
perhaps they'll all

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:90%
become enlightened overnight.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Or possibly we'll
have a mass appearance

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.910 align:middle line:84%
by beings that are
much more advanced.

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And if they show up, we'll all
have to learn really quickly

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.960 align:middle line:84%
about what else is
possible in the universe.

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really
claim to know, but I

00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.050 align:middle line:84%
do think-- so some
kind of ET appearance,

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or appearance by advanced beings
that is widely acknowledged,

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:34.100 align:middle line:84%
would be a spark that would
change people's belief system,

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and will change their
idea of what's possible,

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:41.649 align:middle line:84%
and of what our true
nature is as human beings.

00:59:41.649 --> 00:59:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of
consciousness shift like

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that, I would not be at all
surprised to see by 2012.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> On December 21, 2010, seismic
stations all over the earth

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.190 align:middle line:84%
recorded a strange
cosmic vibration,

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.950 align:middle line:90%
ringing Earth like a giant bell.

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:06.440 align:middle line:84%
The next day, December 22, NASA
reported the largest storm ever

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.940 align:middle line:90%
erupted on Saturn.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:13.600 align:middle line:84%
The storm is larger
than the planet Earth.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.960 align:middle line:84%
These new emerging energy fields
may have a profound effect

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.680 align:middle line:90%
on our consciousness.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They may even be the precursors
to sudden unexplained leaps

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:26.350 align:middle line:84%
in human consciousness
evolution.

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
That is because energy
always carries information.

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.090 align:middle line:84%
The human brain
and consciousness

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:35.120 align:middle line:84%
receive this
information, and evolve.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
The new children being
born into the new sun

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.370 align:middle line:84%
may harbor the kind of
genius and dramatic changes

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.935 align:middle line:84%
we need to survive
the next millennium.

01:00:43.935 --> 01:00:46.910 align:middle line:90%


01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be possible
that the rapture may happen,

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
as we enter the new energy
field within the galaxy?

01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:08.130 align:middle line:90%


01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of a rapture,
where large numbers of people

disappear, or shift to
some other dimension,

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
has been proposed
by other writers,

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
besides the Christian groups
that talk about the rapture.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Canon has written about
the Anasazi, who also appear,

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have disappeared
without leaving

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.560 align:middle line:90%
much of a trace.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Also the dwellers
in Machu Picchu,

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
another possible example, where
we have cases of civilizations

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.865 align:middle line:84%
just vanishing in a very
short amount of time.

01:01:43.865 --> 01:01:45.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, of course, it might
have been migration,

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.870 align:middle line:10%
it might be something
more worldly.

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:55.600 align:middle line:10%
But the idea has been proposed
that dimensions can split,

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.990 align:middle line:10%
and the idea in our synchronous
universe model would be,

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:02.040 align:middle line:10%
here we are one moment, we're
all synchronized-- our matter,

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.280 align:middle line:10%
my body, all the molecules
in the matter around me,

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.760 align:middle line:10%
is all synchronized with
everyone else in the society.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.130 align:middle line:90%
So I see them, they see me.

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:12.570 align:middle line:90%
That's normal.

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But we know that certain
adeps and yogis can cause,

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
by location or teleportation,
by meditating, and shifting

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:27.120 align:middle line:84%
the phase of their frequency
of their vibration,

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they can just pop
out into another dimension,

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
or move to another
location, which

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
might be far away from where
they are at that moment.

01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So the Synchronized Universe
model explains that.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
People, en masse,
has been proposed

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
by prayer or
meditation, may also

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
be able to generate some kind
of collective shift of phase,

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
or shift of frequency-- which
would cause then suddenly

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:56.965 align:middle line:84%
to disappear, to the first
people in the first reality.

01:02:56.965 --> 01:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
They would appear in
another dimension,

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
or another parallel
reality, or could

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
be another location, that may
even be on another planet,

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:04.770 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So this idea of shifting phase,
and thereby shift in position,

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
or shift in parallel
reality, really

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
fits in very naturally with the
Synchronized Universe model.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And it might be one way that
events will transpire as we

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:25.290 align:middle line:90%
go through the next few years.

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:26.230 align:middle line:90%
So we will see.

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But certainly the
model offers a way

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
to understand that, from
a physics point of view.

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> If a single person can travel
physically to another dimension

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and back, as Akhiyon
and others have,

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
certainly we can understand how
it is possible for the higher

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
dimension of the heavens to
separate off millions of higher

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
vibration people
into that dimension.

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
If millions of us
left this dimension,

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
would we become just a
statistic of missing persons?

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Or would it be obvious
that all of those

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that are not of
higher consciousness

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:05.070 align:middle line:90%
suddenly found themselves alone?

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
If such a rift occurs
between worlds,

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:12.060 align:middle line:84%
for those of us who do go into
the higher vibrational Earth,

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:17.780 align:middle line:84%
we will live in a new Earth, and
we will perceive new heavens.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:05:23.456 align:middle line:90%
