The electromagnetic

that the exact same

itself into matter

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
is inherent in every
grain of this stuff.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I was
told that this deposit

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:84%
had the creative force
of the entire universe.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:90%

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:10%
>> The story of
Ormus starts in 1976,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:10%
with a cotton farmer from
Arizona called David Hudson.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:10%
He'd begun analyzing the
mineral content of his land,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:10%
specifically searching
for precious metals, when

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:10%
he began to find strange white
powder that no one seemed

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:10%
to be able to identify.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
His anomalous substance had
some very strange properties.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
In the sunlight, it would
explode in a flash of light.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the dark, it would
float away from his hands.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And at different temperatures,
it would change weight

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.312 align:middle line:84%
and would sometimes
disappear altogether.

00:09:47.312 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Hudson spent millions trying
to find out what he had.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Yet according to
all the analysis,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
his white powder
was pure nothing.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, I was really curious.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Could Ormus be real?

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I began to reason if it's
so difficult to detect Ormus

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
directly, perhaps
measuring its effects would

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
be the easiest way to prove
it does actually exist.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle line:10%
And so I decided to
try and do just that.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Relax.

00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:29.363 align:middle line:90%

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%

power, which is
interesting to me,

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:10%
monoatomic elements."

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:10%
But because it can't be measured
and therefore can't be proven,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:10%
the scientific community
ignored his findings.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:10%
And then in 1992, Hudson
goes a step further

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:10%
and announces that his
white powder is in fact

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:10%
the legendary Philosopher's
Stone, mythical prize

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:10%
of the alchemists, an
elixir of life that

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:10%
will cure all illnesses, bring
about spiritual enlightenment,

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:10%
and turn base metals into gold.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.933 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.933 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
He set out to produce
it for human consumption

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:90%
on a really large scale.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But a disastrous acid leak
caused Hudson's facility

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to shut down just days
before it became operational.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:10%
And then Hudson
simply disappeared.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:22.292 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in the
fact that it's apparently

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
completely new to science or
whether it is actually alchemy.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So I need to try and figure
out how to make gold.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's such
a big thing to ask, is it?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, it turns out it is.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Frustratingly, Arthur won't
show me how he makes gold

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:90%
or even how he makes Ormus.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think there's so
much secrecy around Ormus?

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if anyone is actually
putting Ormus minerals

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
into metallic form on
a commercial scale,

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I can understand why they would
be extremely secretive about

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I'm
secretive about

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
are my own original methods that
I've discovered and developed.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:90%
I protect my methods.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at least now I have a
possible way to prove without

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:90%
a doubt the existence of Ormus.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do is find a
way to turn it into gold.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:10%
A few weeks after
visiting Arthur,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:10%
I finally managed
to find someone who

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:10%
will show me how to make Ormus.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Is this my first step in
learning how to make gold?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> This is our lab, where we
process essential oils and make

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:90%
our products.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.112 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.112 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we're researching

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
is how Ormus and essential
oils work together.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to clear
something up here.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:90%
You're making Ormus.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:90%
What are you making?

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> What are we making?

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what
we're doing is we're

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:84%
taking salt from
various sources,

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:90%
precipitating out the--

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
what we believe to be
the Ormus elements.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Like everyone else I visited,
Peter can't give me a clear

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
definition of what
Ormus actually is.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> This is one-day lye
solution, food-grade lye.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.842 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.842 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to do now
is start dropping it in slowly

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:90%
as I stir.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you now
put the camera in,

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
you'll see it's like
it's snowing in there.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that?

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.805 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to precipitate.

00:19:45.805 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And we'll keep going.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I am slightly surprised to
learn that it takes nothing

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
more than distilled
water, sea salt,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and lye or caustic
soda to make Ormus.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Yet, Peter is absolutely
convinced in its power.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen rapid healings
in myself and others.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I've seen increases in energy,
increases in states of mind.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that doorway open
up many other doorways.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>> With very little science
to back any of this up,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I decide the only way forward
is to continue testing it

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.805 align:middle line:84%
on myself, to become
a human guinea pig.

00:20:27.805 --> 00:20:30.472 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we're going to do is
treat all of the energy centers

00:20:30.472 --> 00:20:32.826 align:middle line:90%
of our bodies, the main ones.

00:20:32.826 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Just one drop?

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Here?

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:84%
As instructed, I
rub Peter's mixtures

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
of essential oils and
Ormus onto my body.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine, like, if you
have that the whole weekend.

00:20:45.144 --> 00:20:52.524 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.524 --> 00:20:55.968 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSHING]

00:20:55.968 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter put a drop of
something on my head.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:90%
I am feeling pretty spaced out.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, kind of like an intensity
to stuff at the moment.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It's really not dissimilar to
the first stages of coming up

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
on an acid trip, like
completely lucid but just

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:90%
a bit spasticated.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.412 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:30.806 align:middle line:84%
And I like my little
hut that I found.

00:21:30.806 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.156 align:middle line:84%
I think I should just
sit down for a minute.

00:21:36.156 --> 00:21:39.144 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.144 --> 00:21:41.449 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:21:41.449 --> 00:21:42.435 align:middle line:90%
Flipping heck.

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:47.365 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.365 --> 00:21:50.816 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:50.816 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.955 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think so few
people have heard about Ormus?

00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they probably
have heard about it,

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.372 align:middle line:84%
but it just goes by
a different name.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:13.122 align:middle line:84%
And you know, these
days, we haven't heard

00:22:13.122 --> 00:22:14.213 align:middle line:90%
about a lot of traditions.

00:22:14.213 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
These substances have
been celebrated and used

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Some, like Peter, believe
the discovery of Ormus was most

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:90%
likely only a rediscovery.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt,
a precious mineral

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
referred to in many
temples and stiles

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:84%
was used by the
priests and pharaohs

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:90%
in many of their rituals.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
The powder was
made by the priests

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and used to make ceremonial
bread cakes for the pharaohs

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
so that they might live
longer and be closer to God.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Centuries later, in 1904,
British archaeologist Sir

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Flinders Petrie stumbled
across a hidden temple

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Serabit in the
middle of the Sinai Desert.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Inside the temple, he
found huge quantities

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of an unknown white
powder that resembled ash.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Yet strangely, he found
no evidence of the fires.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:10%
A few wayward
historians have dared

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:10%
to suggest that this is the very
mountain in the Sinai Desert

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:10%
under which the Hebrews in 1400
BC, led by Moses out of Egypt,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:10%
camped during the
time of the Exodus--

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:10%
Moses, who according to
the unlikely Bible story

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:10%
had been found in the rushes
and adopted by and raised

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.220 align:middle line:10%
in the Egyptian
royal family, Moses,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:10%
who is much more likely to
be the half-Israelite pharaoh

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:10%
Akhenaten, grandson
of Tuthmosis,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:10%
banished to the
Sinai around 1400 BC

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:10%
for trying to ban
the worship of idols

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:10%
and who developed the
notion of a single faceless

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:47.430 align:middle line:10%
god named "Atan."

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:10%
As a pharaoh, Moses
would have known

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:10%
all of the secrets of
the priests and pharaohs.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Moses would have known all
about the bread of life, made

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:90%
from the white powder of gold.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptians called
the powder "mfktz,"

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:10%
but they knew it was
no ordinary mineral.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:10%
"Mfktz" means "what is it."

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:10%
But literally translated,
the hieroglyph

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:10%
reads "spirit, fire,
stone," part magic,

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:10%
part precious mineral.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:10%
"Manna" in Hebrew is also
translated as "what is it,"

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:10%
manna, miraculous edible
substance that God

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.930 align:middle line:10%
provided for the Israelites
during their travels

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:10%
in the Sinai.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was stored by Moses
in the Ark of the Covenant.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.310 align:middle line:10%
Does this also shed light
on a strange story in Exodus

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:10%
when Moses, furious that
his people were worshipping

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:10%
an idol of a golden calf, took
the golden statue, burnt it

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:10%
in the fire, ground it to a
powder, mixed it with water,

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.628 align:middle line:10%
and made the children
of Israel drink of it?

00:24:47.628 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Was knowledge of the
secret arts of alchemy

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:10%
what the Hebrews
had been chosen for?

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:10%
Did Jesus know about
these processes?

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Was he an alchemist?

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:10%
And his alleged progeny,
the Knights Templar,

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:10%
who took their name
from Solomon's temple,

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:10%

And notice the vortex
inside as it goes.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the water
comes in here at an angle.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Because that angle
causes it to spin,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that means that that
vortex is literally

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:84%
holding that air inside
and keeping it there.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
These magnets repel anything
that's super conductive.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They repel anything
that's anti-magnetic,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.090 align:middle line:84%
or it's also called
"diamagnetic."

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And when they repel it,
they drive it to the center.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Since the return flow is
coming down the center,

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:84%
that's where this
stuff comes out.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:90%

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> These are a group of
previously unknown minerals.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
The reason that they're
unknown to science

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't show
up spectroscopically

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
in spectroscopic assay,
like ordinary minerals do.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%

that they're probably

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But then the reality of
what they're willing to show

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:84%
is a water that perhaps
is slightly oilier

is it theoretically possible

to turn one element
into another,

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:10%
but it has been done before.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.186 align:middle line:10%
And it's called "transmutation."

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:10%
The periodic table

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:10%
arranges the elemental
atoms according

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:10%
to their atomic
number, the number

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:10%
of protons in the nuclei.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
On the whole, this will also
be the number of electrons

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.820 align:middle line:90%
in the electron cloud.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Those negatively
charged electrons

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:84%
will balance the positive
charge of the protons.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen, the most
abundant element

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.910 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, for example,
has the atomic number one.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It has one proton, no neutrons,
and a single electron.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Gold has the atomic number 79.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So it has 79 protons, 79
electrons, and 180 neutrons.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Next along is mercury.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, atomic number 80,
has 80 protons, 80 electrons,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and 121 neutrons.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So to make mercury into
gold, all you have to do

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.330 align:middle line:84%
is subtract one proton, one
electron, and three neutrons.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.110 align:middle line:90%
It can be done.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It has been done.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
As far back as 1901, when Ernest
Rutherford and Frederick Soddy,

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%

thorium was converting itself

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.640 align:middle line:84%
into radium, Soddy
later recalled

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.750 align:middle line:84%
shouting at Rutherford,
"Rutherford, this

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:90%
is transmutation!"

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Rutherford snapped back,
for Christ's sake, Soddy,

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.035 align:middle line:90%
don't call it "transmutation."

00:33:55.035 --> 00:33:57.298 align:middle line:84%
They'll have our heads
off as alchemists.

00:33:57.298 --> 00:34:01.170 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.423 align:middle line:84%
So why is it so few
people are doing it?

00:34:04.423 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, because as far as the
scientific establishment

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.860 align:middle line:84%
is concerned, you need
a particle collider

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
or a nuclear reaction
to make it happen.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
there's so much secrecy

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.179 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the subject?

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:26.139 align:middle line:84%
>> People-- most people who are
aware of Ormus realize that it

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:84%
has the potential of
bringing a lot of change.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And any structure that's
been set up to resist change

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:90%
will resist that.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:84%
So people are careful about
sharing too much information

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:84%
about it or careful
about putting it

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:84%
in certain places,
because they don't

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:84%
want to encounter a structure
that is resisting change.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Barry is another dead end.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Whatever he knows about
low-energy transmutation,

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:90%
he's keeping to himself.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They all feel like people
will die because of this.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.590 align:middle line:84%
People have been
killed because of this.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's true,
but it seems to me

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:25.140 align:middle line:84%
he feels he has the
secret to something that

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.372 align:middle line:84%
can make him wealthy or
that can change the world

00:35:28.372 --> 00:35:30.276 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:35:30.276 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:90%


00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to you, oh, about
two, three weeks ago.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:90%
You know who I am then.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.718 align:middle line:90%
Then my luck changes.

00:35:43.718 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:10%
I manage to get
through to Don Nance,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.690 align:middle line:10%
a well-known and
respected alchemist.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:10%
And he invites me to come
to his home in Florida.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Don tells me he has not
only successfully made gold

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:90%
using Ormus.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But he has had his results
tested in scientific assays

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.690 align:middle line:90%
to back it up.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:07.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:36:07.674 --> 00:36:08.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Don.

00:36:08.658 --> 00:36:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you?

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.358 align:middle line:84%
The first item on here
is spa Dead Sea salt.

00:36:17.358 --> 00:36:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And here, you see
that the salt itself

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:28.881 align:middle line:84%
contains of silver less
than 0.05 parts per billion,

00:36:28.881 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and with gold, 0.36
parts per billion.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:39.270 align:middle line:10%
Well, I took this
same dried material,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:10%
and I did King
Solomon's process on it.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And I sent it off for another
assay after doing that.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.490 align:middle line:84%
On the silver, the
fire assay came out

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:90%
to 279.4 ounces per ton.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start to see
the huge astronomical difference

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:07.320 align:middle line:84%
between what we started with and
what we, so far, have ended up

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.690 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It's all real.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's making
these results up.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And here's the certified assay.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.375 align:middle line:90%
It's signed, dated, and stamped.

00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:26.080 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> For Don, these results
conclusively prove

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:90%
the existence of Ormus.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>> How can someone say
that it doesn't exist?

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.460 align:middle line:84%
That's extreme denial to
the point of insanity.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a scientist
sitting there saying that,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.415 align:middle line:84%
you need to go and
talk to a therapist,

00:37:44.415 --> 00:37:46.415 align:middle line:84%
because you're really out
of touch with reality.

00:37:46.415 --> 00:37:55.730 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
That's all that's left of it,
since I've been digging in it

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.120 align:middle line:90%
and getting gold out of it.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like it would
contain any gold or silver

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.290 align:middle line:90%
But I have 279 ounces per ton.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:16.140 align:middle line:90%


00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> When Don was diagnosed
with cancer 10 years ago,

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.570 align:middle line:84%
he started taking
Ormus as a last resort.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.417 align:middle line:90%
>> I got out of bed.

00:38:22.417 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
literally like somebody

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:90%
turned the light switch on.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to
the same doctor,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and I was miraculously
clear of cancer.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I've seen too many
things happen, too many

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.040 align:middle line:90%
things that are just--

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.350 align:middle line:90%
cannot be ignored.

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:50.986 align:middle line:84%
And yet, science tends to
largely want to ignore them.

00:38:50.986 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a question
that needs to be asked.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you can make gold,
why aren't you richer?

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I about killed myself
making the half of a bucketful

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:14.710 align:middle line:90%
that I made.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:84%
That was five years
ago, and I still

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:90%
haven't recovered from it.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Think the radiation-damaged
beaker will show up?

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.592 align:middle line:84%
It was radioactive
for quite a while.

00:39:29.592 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It's what made me sick.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to tell people
how to make the gold the way

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that I did it, because it's
the wrong way to do it.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:84%
You can see what
it did to the brand

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:53.200 align:middle line:84%
new stainless steel container
when you're trying to force it

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.840 align:middle line:90%
back down to metal--

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.555 align:middle line:84%
peeled it like an onion
below the boiling temperature

00:39:58.555 --> 00:40:01.178 align:middle line:90%
of water.

00:40:01.178 --> 00:40:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the kind
of radiation that

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:08.530 align:middle line:84%
does this at low temperatures
is beta and gamma.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And they will kill you.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:90%
It nearly killed me.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And finally, Don shows me
what I've been waiting to see.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can imagine what
happened to me when I was

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
forcing them down with high
heat and stuff to make this gold

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:90%
metal.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:90%
That's gold, is it?

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.781 align:middle line:90%
>> It's at least 24-karat.

00:40:32.781 --> 00:40:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure what
to believe anymore.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But Don tells me
of a guy in Utah,

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.630 align:middle line:84%
who supposedly uses a more
modern and safer technique

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:90%
to-- to make gold.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.740 align:middle line:10%
So I decide, what the hell?

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.140 align:middle line:10%
In for a penny, in for a pound.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.250 align:middle line:10%
Would you consider
yourself an alchemist?

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, technically,
I am an alchemist.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you're
making gold, aren't you?

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Actually making gold?

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually physically making
gold in gram-sized and even

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:90%
ounce-sized quantities of gold.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And sure enough, right there
on his bookshelf is more gold.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:26.650 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We can take a bar of silver
and get 30% to 40% conversion

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of it into gold.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Champion tells
me he made it himself,

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
using a kind of homemade
nuclear reactor.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- you're
working in a garage.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> This is it?

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> This is it.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm amazed.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:10%
It's-- you're making
gold in a garage.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What else can you show me?

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I tell you what.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Not on camera, I can
show you what's inside.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll turn the camera off.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why he asked
me to turn the camera off.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Inside, all I saw was
what looked like a Subway

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.670 align:middle line:90%
sandwich wrapped in tinfoil.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I brought a piece of silver
with me, as you requested.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Six ounces.

00:42:18.835 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And what's going
to happen to it?

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.185 align:middle line:90%
That we're going to--

00:42:21.185 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:90%
I convert it to 30%--

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.260 align:middle line:90%
to 40% gold.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> These nuclear reactions
you're talking about--

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes--

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this cold fission?

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Cold fusion.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Cold fusion.

00:42:32.902 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not, but it's
very similar to it.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.380 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're not
going to just paint it?

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I do-- well, you'd be able
to scratch it and find out that

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.898 align:middle line:84%
the go runs all
the way through it.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I have no idea
what to make of that.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.388 align:middle line:90%
Is he absolutely mad?

00:42:54.388 --> 00:42:56.305 align:middle line:84%
Or is this-- is he going
to get a Nobel Prize?

00:42:56.305 --> 00:43:00.943 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.943 --> 00:43:03.378 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:03.378 --> 00:43:04.840 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.310 align:middle line:90%
That is insane.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:10.402 align:middle line:84%
That was crazy,
absolutely crazy.

00:43:10.402 --> 00:43:11.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Three, two, one.

00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> A week later, it's
time to collect my gold.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.610 align:middle line:90%
You've got something to show me?

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know how
well you can see that,

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.290 align:middle line:90%
as far as the gold in it.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But this is that six-ounce
silver bar you bought me.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:90%
We tested.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:36.960 align:middle line:84%
It tested eight- to 10-karat
gold by electronic tester.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And we did a
physical test today.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I actually drilled it, as you
can see the drill holes in it

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:47.070 align:middle line:84%
at different places,
two drill holes.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And did the spot test on the
drill holes with nitric acid.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, the inside
of the drill holes are gold.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't understand how it
can be physically the same size,

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:84%
yet be more gold now and
not have changed its shape

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.620 align:middle line:90%
if the density's higher.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I tell you what, it's--

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:11.490 align:middle line:10%
well, try to put your
mind around it this way.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.490 align:middle line:84%
If you've got two
atoms of silver--

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.210 align:middle line:90%
silver's a diatomic molecule--

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and you form those two
atoms in silver into gold,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:90%
they're going--

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the actual physical
outside is going

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.358 align:middle line:84%
to occupy close
to the same space.

00:44:26.358 --> 00:44:28.275 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to change
just from my reactor.

00:44:28.275 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:35.588 align:middle line:84%
>> I have no idea how that
went, what to think of that.

00:44:35.588 --> 00:44:37.130 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really
give me any answers.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:84%
What he did give me
is some bars, which

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:45.510 align:middle line:84%
if they really are gold, I mean,
that's absolutely outstanding.

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:49.290 align:middle line:84%
He's either mad as a teaspoon
or an absolute genius.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I could only think of one
quick way to find out which.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:59.270 align:middle line:90%


00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pure silver's all it is.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.020 align:middle line:90%


00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It looks pretty silver to me.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> That guy's so
full of baloney.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.416 align:middle line:84%
You sure he's not out of
some sort of institute?

00:45:11.416 --> 00:45:14.392 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:45:14.392 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Heard a lot of
stories in my life.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:23.830 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And so after a year
spent crisscrossing America,

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out
how to make gold,

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.140 align:middle line:84%
all I have to show for it is
a fucked-up silver bar with

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.090 align:middle line:90%
a hole drilled in it.

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It really feels like
the end of the road.

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:44.910 align:middle line:90%
[PHONE RINGING]

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I get a
major breakthrough.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.490 align:middle line:84%
David Hudson, the guy who first
discovered Ormus on his farm

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:57.300 align:middle line:84%
back in the 1970s and then
disappeared, contacts me.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.540 align:middle line:90%
That sounds good.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.432 align:middle line:84%
He said he-- the
main points of what

00:46:01.432 --> 00:46:03.200 align:middle line:84%
he spoke about was that
he's not interested in being

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.000 align:middle line:90%
interviewed.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.360 align:middle line:90%
He'll chat to me.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:12.500 align:middle line:84%
He will chat to me,
but not on camera.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.450 align:middle line:90%
He wants to meet me in Phoenix.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So despite being out
of time and money,

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I drop everything and
get back on the road.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It feels like this
is my last chance

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:25.970 align:middle line:84%
to get to the heart
of this mystery.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.038 align:middle line:90%


00:46:29.038 --> 00:46:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I'm
meeting David Hudson.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a car park
waiting for him.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to meet in a
restaurant and have a chat.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:43.370 align:middle line:90%


00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, he wouldn't talk to
me, not on camera, anyway.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.580 align:middle line:90%
He's a very nice guy--

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.730 align:middle line:90%
had a really long chat with him.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But he wouldn't talk
to me, which is a pity.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.660 align:middle line:84%
He's definitely very much
involved still in-- in Ormus.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.720 align:middle line:84%
He has very little regard
for any of the people

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.907 align:middle line:90%
I've spoken to so far.

00:47:01.907 --> 00:47:03.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, actively dislikes
quite a number of them.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:12.530 align:middle line:84%
He says he's working with some
very, very wealthy, very, very

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.040 align:middle line:90%
connected people out in Taiwan.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And maybe later down the line--

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:20.360 align:middle line:90%
maybe later on, he'll--

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.900 align:middle line:90%
he'll get back to me.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.662 align:middle line:90%
But for now, he's not going to--

00:47:27.662 --> 00:47:28.620 align:middle line:90%
he's not going to talk.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.980 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:44.147 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.147 --> 00:47:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> (ON PHONE) Hello.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.950 align:middle line:84%
You have reached the office
of David and Brannon.

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:50.425 align:middle line:84%
Please leave a message
for David after the tone.

00:47:50.425 --> 00:47:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Or press "two" to leave
a message for Brannon.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:53.890 align:middle line:90%
[BEEP]

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.620 align:middle line:90%
This is a message for David.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.710 align:middle line:90%
It's Joe--

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:84%
After we had met, Hudson
didn't return my calls

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:01.960 align:middle line:90%
or answer any emails.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself shut
out of the Ormus community.

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I can't
seem to let this go.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
one rumor I've heard

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.758 align:middle line:84%
is that there's going
to be another Ormus

00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:13.630 align:middle line:90%
conference in a few weeks.

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, David Hudson
is going to speak there.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.290 align:middle line:90%
So I'll have one last attempt.

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.880 align:middle line:84%
See if I can get
him to talk to me.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I took a chance
and bought a ticket

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.410 align:middle line:90%
for the Ormus conference.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.593 align:middle line:84%
Tickets to these events are
not cheap at $500 a head.

00:48:26.593 --> 00:48:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Neither are all of the
Ormus products on sale.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I arrive,
there is the man himself,

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.842 align:middle line:90%
David Hudson, holding court.

00:48:38.842 --> 00:48:40.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Precious metals are rare.

00:48:40.009 --> 00:48:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But precious elements
are everywhere.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.295 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a lot of questions.

00:48:44.295 --> 00:48:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But surprisingly, Hudson
refuses to talk to me

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.432 align:middle line:84%
or let me use any footage
of him in this documentary.

00:48:49.432 --> 00:48:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell him he needs to stop.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.640 align:middle line:90%
You need to stop.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.824 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I can't have
the primary upset, OK?

00:48:55.824 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:10%
There is a very strong
request not to film this, OK?

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.000 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.010 align:middle line:10%
>> From who?

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:02.970 align:middle line:10%
>> From everybody.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:06.407 align:middle line:10%
I was like, I'm trying to
get why are you getting this?

00:49:06.407 --> 00:49:07.490 align:middle line:10%
Who are you in the matter?

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.722 align:middle line:10%
What do we all get from this?

00:49:09.722 --> 00:49:13.327 align:middle line:90%


00:49:13.327 --> 00:49:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> But I stayed, anyway, to
listen to his talk and watch

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.570 align:middle line:84%
the audience gobble
up his every word.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:21.420 align:middle line:84%
His talk started well, a
point-by-point breakdown,

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.810 align:middle line:84%
with evidence of his
initial discovery.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And then-- well, let
me quote for you.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.180 align:middle line:90%


00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.780 align:middle line:84%
"You will telepathically
know the thoughts of others

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.550 align:middle line:90%
that are in the room with you.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.950 align:middle line:10%
You are going to
be like an angel.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:37.990 align:middle line:10%
You will literally be
able to take a sick child

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.080 align:middle line:10%
in a hospital, hold him in your
arms for two or three minutes,

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and place him down.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And he will be cured, and you
will literally stop aging."

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:50.450 align:middle line:84%
He concluded his talk
by inviting donations

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:51.700 align:middle line:90%
to help with further research.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Barry was also at
the conference,

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.040 align:middle line:84%
but it was Don who seemed
the most pleased to see me.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him again if
he'll show me how to make gold.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Pardon?

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:08.188 align:middle line:84%
>> You understand why I chose
to follow the gold, don't you?

00:50:08.188 --> 00:50:10.930 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You want to demonstrate
the anomaly there.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And I understand you
wanting to do that.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:22.440 align:middle line:10%
But it creates a tremendous
amount of pollution.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.220 align:middle line:10%
It creates radiation.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:30.540 align:middle line:10%
And anybody that tries it,
in my opinion, is an idiot.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> But after explaining that
if I can't make gold out of it,

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.200 align:middle line:84%
no one will believe that
Ormus really exists,

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Don finally agrees to
show me how to make gold,

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.310 align:middle line:84%
but only if I don't
reveal the entire process.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have any problem
actually doing the work

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and having you, yourself, and
maybe some other people watch

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:55.610 align:middle line:84%
it, verify it, say that, yeah,
you saw this with your own two

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.675 align:middle line:84%
eyes so you know there
wasn't any funny business.

00:50:57.675 --> 00:51:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So two weeks later,
I fly back to Florida,

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.320 align:middle line:84%
ready to finally
make my own gold.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>> What's up, dude?

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.009 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:51:13.009 --> 00:51:28.478 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.478 --> 00:51:29.476 align:middle line:90%
Raw gold.

00:51:29.476 --> 00:51:36.961 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:38.458 align:middle line:84%
>> You make it look
very easy, Don.

00:51:38.458 --> 00:51:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool, brother.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's stage
one done, isn't it?

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:54.626 --> 00:52:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is what Don says
we got to put out in the--

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:90%
in the sunlight.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:27.035 align:middle line:90%


00:52:27.035 --> 00:52:27.835 align:middle line:90%
That's all of it.

00:52:27.835 --> 00:52:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:32.564 align:middle line:90%
>> You shall be gold.

00:52:32.564 --> 00:52:33.364 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:52:33.364 --> 00:52:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:46.830 align:middle line:84%
You talk to a lot of people
that, if they know something,

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.000 align:middle line:90%
won't talk.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.668 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:52:49.668 --> 00:52:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trusting you to
do this in the right way.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.840 align:middle line:84%
There really is low-energy
transmutation going on.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.011 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.011 --> 00:53:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've told
you personally more

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.560 align:middle line:84%
about this than any other
person on the planet.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:12.150 align:middle line:90%


00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:14.990 align:middle line:10%
The reason I think that this
is going to be a good location

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:24.570 align:middle line:10%
to do the burn is it's about
as far removed from people

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.660 align:middle line:10%
as we can get within 100 miles.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you a once-around.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.632 align:middle line:90%
That one in the-- right there.

00:53:33.632 --> 00:53:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.364 align:middle line:90%
We can make gold here.

00:53:39.364 --> 00:53:40.816 align:middle line:90%
This is nice.

00:53:40.816 --> 00:53:41.784 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:53:41.784 --> 00:53:49.060 align:middle line:90%


00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.412 align:middle line:84%
You don't mind if the air smells
funny for a few days, do you?

00:53:52.412 --> 00:53:55.304 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:53:55.304 --> 00:53:58.680 align:middle line:90%


00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got-- the Geiger
counter's just there that

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.810 align:middle line:90%
arrived at Don's.

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I feel vaguely ridiculous buying
these things, to be honest.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm setting
myself up to believe

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that Don's going to create
something radioactive in a pot

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.250 align:middle line:90%
by just burning it.

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know, most of the
rational side of my being

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.975 align:middle line:84%
is saying, it's complete
crap, obviously.

00:54:31.975 --> 00:54:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
through, figure out how

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.808 align:middle line:90%
to use these Geiger counters.

00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:38.260 align:middle line:90%


00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.060 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.602 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that
rests on tomorrow.

00:54:40.602 --> 00:54:48.010 align:middle line:90%


00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:49.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:54:49.002 --> 00:55:03.386 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.386 --> 00:55:04.874 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing yet.

00:55:04.874 --> 00:55:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.450 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:47.890 align:middle line:90%
It's all about this envelope.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Over the last three
years, I have come up

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.630 align:middle line:84%
against secrecy,
pseudoscience, and, at times,

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:58.500 align:middle line:90%
downright quackery.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And I still have very
little real evidence at all

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.390 align:middle line:90%
that Ormus exists.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.606 align:middle line:84%
And so it all
comes down to this.

00:56:05.606 --> 00:56:07.064 align:middle line:90%
>> It's round two.

00:56:07.064 --> 00:56:15.820 align:middle line:90%


00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So with my journey
now at its end,

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.950 align:middle line:90%
did I learn how to make gold?

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:21.575 align:middle line:90%
Well, sort of.

00:56:21.575 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get the
kinds of results

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that Don got five years ago
and certainly not enough

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:27.210 align:middle line:90%
to make me rich.

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:29.460 align:middle line:10%
But I did get something.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.010 align:middle line:10%
The first stage of the process
caused the gold content

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:34.750 align:middle line:10%
to increase 100-fold.

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.690 align:middle line:10%
But by the end, the
analysis that came back

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.960 align:middle line:10%
had 2,000 times the
amount of gold and silver.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It is very small amounts
I'm talking about,

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:44.690 align:middle line:90%
parts per billion, in fact.

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:46.340 align:middle line:10%
But it is enough
to be considered

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:50.540 align:middle line:10%
real empirical data, data that
supports the theory that there

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:54.290 align:middle line:10%
is a substance, called "Ormus"
by some, that we don't yet

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:58.550 align:middle line:10%
know how to analyze but that
can, under certain conditions,

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:02.220 align:middle line:10%
become a recognized metal.

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.348 align:middle line:84%
And if that part of
the story is true,

00:57:04.348 --> 00:57:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm inclined to join in with
the believers and the alchemists

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:11.140 align:middle line:84%
of past and of the present
and say that Ormus really

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.820 align:middle line:90%
does exist.

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And making chunks of gold
out of it, well, why not?

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.180 align:middle line:90%
After all, anything is possible.

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:22.830 align:middle line:90%
