00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine for a moment
historians of the distant

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.780 align:middle line:84%
future grappling with the
question of which event best

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.750 align:middle line:84%
described the
latter 20th century.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Would it be the explosion
of the first atomic bomb?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Or the emergence
of the internet?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Or even the astonishing
creation of 500 channels

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:84%
of television without
anything much worth watching?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But then again, it just might
be the moment on June the 24th,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
1947 when the pilot of a single
engine plane, a salesman named

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold,
was amazed to see

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
nine metallic objects
zooming past Mount

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Rainier at impossible speeds.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Flying, he said,
like saucers would

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:90%
if you skipped them on water.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
In the following
weeks, thousands

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:84%
of reports of flying
saucers flooded

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:90%
in from much of the world.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
In the shadow of the atomic
age, the era of UFOs had begun.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) We lived
our little drama.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:90%
We kissed in a field of white.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:90%
And stars fell on Alabama.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But why is this event so
important that it should even

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
be mentioned alongside the
most expressive milestones

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:90%
of the last century?

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We bring you this special
radio television broadcast

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
in order to give you the
very latest information

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:90%
on an amazing phenomenon.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, perhaps it's because
it was the first portent

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of the time when our
world will change forever,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the cataclysmic instant when
certainty dawns that there are

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
others out there far
more advanced than us,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
that we are not the pinnacle
of creation we have taken

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to be, that we are
only mere babes emerging from

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:90%
our planetary cradle.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it's important
because the story

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of how the momentous question,
are we being visited,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
arose, evolved, and was
eventually dismissed

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:90%
by much of mainstream culture.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
It is a story that
tells us a lot

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
about our civilization,
its hopes, its fears,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.245 align:middle line:90%
and its secret workings.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Like all good tales,
it needs a teller.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:90%
I was probably born for it.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at those
hands pointing to the sky.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:10%
By age eight, I was
a boy astronomer,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:10%
a certified outer space junkie.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
At 13, having precociously
chosen a career

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
path in astrophysics, I was
home from school for lunch

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
when I heard the tail
end of a news report

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that a flying saucer had
been seen over the city

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and children were
hiding under their beds.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I left early to walk
back to school eagerly

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.045 align:middle line:90%
scanning the skies.

00:02:57.045 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
As I crossed the
playing field, I

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
spotted a red dot at
12:00 o'clock high.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And like a balloon,
it just sat there

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
not moving in the slightest.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
When I came out later
for recess, it was gone.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
That night, I went
to the public library

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and took out every book I could
find about flying saucers.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I followed the subject
off and on ever since.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a strange and
fascinating mystery

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that's hard to penetrate because
there are no good one stop

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:90%
sources of information.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And the gold is
almost impossible

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.405 align:middle line:90%
to separate from the dross.

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Flying saucers have
invaded our planet.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>> The evidence,
as we shall see,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:10%
that some UFOs are from
somewhere else may be very

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:10%
compelling.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's no smoking gun,
no landing on the White House

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.172 align:middle line:90%
lawn.

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:10%
>> They've set up an
electronic screen.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:10%
>> However, it is precisely
this absence of proof that has

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:10%
allowed us to turn the UFO
phenomenon into a Rorschach ink

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:10%
blot, an amorphous shape
on which we have projected

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:10%
our hopes and fears.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:90%
We have mythologized it.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> People of Earth, attention.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the process,
we've made it difficult,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
if not impossible, to address
the question of its reality.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is the story
of how that happened.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And it begins, if
it has a beginning,

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific Northwest
on the 24th of June 1947.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:84%
While he was flying
home to Idaho

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a business
trip, Kenneth Arnold

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
spent an hour searching for a
downed plane in the wilderness

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%
of Washington state.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a bright sunny day
with perfect visibility,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:90%
but he had no luck.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Arnold sold forest
firefighting equipment

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
hopping about the Northwest
in his single engine CallAir.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
As he turned towards home,
a blinding flash of light

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:90%
caught his attention.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:84%
He located its source as
sunlight reflecting off

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
the metallic surface
of nine objects flying

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:90%
south past Mount Rainier.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Arnold clocked their speed
over the 47 mile distance

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to Mount Adams at
1,800 miles an hour,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
almost four times
faster than any plane

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:90%
known to be flying at the time.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Thinking they might be test
craft and 1,800 miles an hour

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
was too fast to
even contemplate,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
he cut it to 1,200
miles an hour when

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
he reported what he'd
seen to a local newspaper.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The story was picked up
by the AP wire service,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and a headline writer
labeled them flying saucers.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>> He certainly had to be flying
in a very strong inversion.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:10%
The possibilities of there
being optical illusions

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:10%
in that situation was something
that was a possibility.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Mirages do seem to be
moving and moving fast.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:10%
>> If it's a mountain mirage
which he's talking about,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:10%
they stay above the
tops of the mountains.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:10%
They don't move laterally.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And they fade in and out.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:10%
And of course, they appear
to be inverted images

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:10%
of the top of the mountain.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Another more recent
explanation was geese.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
The most recent one,
which has actually

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:84%
led to a new
terminology, and Ufology

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
called pelicanism where you
take a explanation which

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.990 align:middle line:84%
seems, to me anyway,
and a careful analysis

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.052 align:middle line:90%
to be totally ridiculous.

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And you push it as
hard as you can.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Ornithologists think
it could be pelicans.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.245 align:middle line:84%
Pelicans can be very bright
when reflecting sunlight.

00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And apparently, they
can move quite fast,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:84%
clocked on Arnold's watch
merrily gliding along at 1,800

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
miles an hour.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Meteors have also
been suggested.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:10%
Though, how meteors could
have traveled for 47

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:10%
plus miles
horizontally has never

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:10%
been explained,
nor how they could

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:10%
resemble what Arnold drew.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Even though there
had been dozens

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of local reports of strange
aerial objects in the preceding

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.930 align:middle line:84%
months, Arnold's sightings
seemed to open a floodgate.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:10%
Within weeks, there were
more than 3,000 reports

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:10%
from across North America
and around the world.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, it's been
suggested, people

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
were collectively suffering
some trauma induced delusion,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
a reaction to the threat of mass
destruction of a scale never

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:90%
seen before.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is the motion picture
spectacle of all time,

00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
a million tons of water
alive with deadly rays,

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:84%
awe inspiring in its
significance for man who

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
learned how to control the atom
but must now learn to control

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> In the midst of the
1947 flying saucer wave,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
on July the 7th, the Army
Air Force Base at Roswell,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, the home of the only
atomic bomb wing in the world,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.595 align:middle line:84%
issued a press release that it
had recovered a crashed disk.

00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
The DJ at radio
station KGFL says

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
he was the first to get
the release from Walter

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Haut, the base PR officer.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:10%
>> He hands me this release.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.625 align:middle line:10%
And he runs around.

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:10%
He said, you got 30 minutes.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And he's practically
running out the door.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at it,
and I saw a flying saucer.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a minute.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Walter, you know.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going out
hollering after him.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, I got to
get back to the base.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:90%
You got 30 minutes.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.390 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get him to stop.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So I had to wait because he said
he's going back to his office.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I had his number,
called, got him.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.552 align:middle line:84%
I said, Walter,
don't run this story.

00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:84%
If you do, you're
going to be in trouble.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:90%
They'll ship you off to Siberia.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I remember mentioning that.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.760 align:middle line:84%
That was a common
phrase in those days.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:90%
And he said, look.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, the old man
has cleared this.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to use it.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The Army Air Force has
announced that a flying disk

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:84%
has been found and is now in
the possession of the Army.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> About that time,
all hell broke loose.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:90%
The wire went dead.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.857 align:middle line:90%
And the phones began to ring.

00:09:02.857 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And the cavalry
came to the rescue.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
The next day at Fort Worth
headquarters, General Roger

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Ramey informed a
breathless media

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that the intelligence
officers of the only A bomb

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:84%
base in the US arsenal had
mistaken a common weather

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
balloon for a crashed
flying saucer.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
The press ran the story without
so much as an arched eyebrow.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was the last we'd
hear of Roswell for another 35

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
years, when it would
begin to blow up

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
into the culture with all
the power of an atomic bomb.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The long awaited unification
of the armed services comes

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:90%
a step nearer.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> A few weeks after Roswell,
the signing of the National

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Securities Act reorganized the
Armed Forces and established

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the CIA and the National
Security Council.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> An iron curtain has
descended across continent.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The Cold War was
officially underway.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
By August, flying saucer
reports had dropped,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and the press had pretty
well assigned the subject

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:90%
to the crank file.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
After all, no one had seen
or photographed one close up.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And the military was at
least publicly making

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:90%
light of the whole idea.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But behind the scenes,
things were different.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.890 align:middle line:10%
>> This was something that the
intelligence community took

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:10%
seriously immediately.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:10%
There was a desk called
the collections desk

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:10%
in the Pentagon
that was interested

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:10%
in dangerous possible
invasions of American airspace.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:10%
And this looked
like that well could

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:10%
be what this was all about.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pentagon sent a request
for an evaluation to Air

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Materiel Command at Wright
Field in Dayton, Ohio.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:10%
After a preliminary
intelligence gathering,

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:10%
a memo was sent
back to the Pentagon

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:10%
by Lieutenant General Nathan
Twining, the commanding officer

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:10%
of Air Materiel Command.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:10%
It concluded that the phenomenon
is something real and not

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.460 align:middle line:10%
visionary or fictitious
and that the extreme rates

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:10%
of climb, maneuverability,
and motion, which

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:10%
must be considered
evasive when sighted

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:10%
or contacted by friendly
aircraft and radar,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:10%
lend belief to the possibility
that some of the objects

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:10%
are controlled.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The natural belief was that
this must be Soviet technology.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:84%
The idea that it
was extraterrestrial

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
did not really come up
there at the very beginning.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Finally, Twining's memo
went on to recommend a detailed

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:10%
codenamed study.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Project Sign was approved
at the end of December

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
as part of the Air Technical
Intelligence Center

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
at Wright Patterson
Air Force Base.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It immediately had to
contend with a disaster,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
an Air Force plane had
gone down chasing a UFO.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.200 align:middle line:84%
On January 7, 1948, Kentucky Air
National Guard Captain Thomas

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
F. Mantell's F-51
fighter fell to earth.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
He had been chasing a
strange object in the sky.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
People have always seen
mysterious things in the sky

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and attributed them
to unearthly beings.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
In biblical times, it
would appear that angels

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:90%
zipped about quite frequently.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:10%
In one Old Testament tale
often construed as a UFO event,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:10%
a fiery wheel carried
the prophet Ezekiel off

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:10%
to the heavens.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
From the Middle Ages up to
the Industrial Revolution,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
ecclesiastical symbols found
their way into works of art

00:12:54.890 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:84%
as celestial events interpreted
today by many as UFOs.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
In the 18th century,
possibly as a reaction

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to the rationality
of the Enlightenment,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
there emerged a whole genre
of fantastic voyage tales.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The most prominent
one we know of is

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:90%
"Gulliver's Travels."

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:10%
But in the fantastic
voyage tales

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:10%
of which there were
hundreds published,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:10%
people go traveling to all
kinds of different places,

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:10%
including outer space.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> In the last decades of the
19th century, many astronomers,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:84%
even such luminaries
as Percival Lowell,

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
observed a fantastic network of
canals on the surface of Mars.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:10%
Around the same time,
there were thousands

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:10%
of reports of airships
throughout much

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:10%
of North America,
almost all of which

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:10%
are now accepted as hoaxes,
mistaken natural phenomena,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:10%
or the inventions of readership
hungry newspaper editors.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:10%
>> One newspaper in one town
would play a joke on another

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:10%
town and say they would give
this elaborate article about

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:10%
this fantastic airship
sighting in the other town.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
The town where it actually
happens would say,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:90%
nobody here saw that thing.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:10%
It was a form of entertainment.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Moving from the
profane to the sacred,

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
at least one of the famous
apparitions of the Virgin Mary

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:84%
at Fatima Portugal could
easily have been a classic UFO

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%
sighting.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
The clouds broke
and the sun appeared

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:84%
as an opaque spinning
disk in the sky.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It was significantly
less bright than normal,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and it careened towards the
earth in a zigzag pattern.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But it could also read like
religious believers fired up

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
with faith staring
too long at the sun.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:10%
Though the notion of
life on other worlds

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:10%
had been around since at least
the ancient Greek Atomos,

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:10%
it was the scientific and
technological breakthrough

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:10%
explosions of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:10%
that provided fertile
ground for the idea

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:10%
to take wide hold
in popular culture.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:10%
Pulp science fiction magazines
filled the newsstands,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:10%
their covers often showing
prescient illustrations

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:10%
of what would be
described in the 1947 wave

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.955 align:middle line:10%
as flying saucers.

00:15:11.955 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The broadcasting system and
its affiliated stations present

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Orson Welles and the Mercury
Theater on the Air in "The War

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:90%
of the Worlds" by H.G. Wells.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We know now that in the
early years of the 20th century,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
this world was being watched
closely by intelligences

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:90%
greater than man.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Orson Welles' 1938 Halloween
broadcast sent thousands

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:90%
of listeners into a panic.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.884 align:middle line:90%
>> There's something happening.

00:15:45.884 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Some shape is rising
out of the pit.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:90%
--the advancing men.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It strikes them head on.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Oh lord, they're
turning into flames.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It quite clearly showed that
beneath the surface of things

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial lay
something darkly visceral,

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the fear of the other, a
theme that would emerge again

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.233 align:middle line:90%
in those early days of 1948.

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and gentlemen,
due to circumstances beyond

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
our control, we are unable--

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The Air Force accident
investigators concluded that

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Captain Thomas F. Mantell had
blacked out from lack of oxygen

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:90%
at 25,000 feet.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes earlier,
he had radioed

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that he had spotted the
object high above him

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and was climbing to
get a closer look.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
He described it as metallic
and tremendous in size.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
After Mantell apparently
lost consciousness,

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
his plane had climbed to 30,000
feet when it stalled and began

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
its death spiral to earth.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
News that a pilot had died
chasing a flying saucer

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:90%
shot across the wires.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force
investigators announced

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that Mantell had died
chasing the planet

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
Venus, an explanation
that seemed ridiculous

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
given his description
and eyewitness

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
accounts of a large, slow
moving, cone-shaped object.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:84%
In the early '50s, the Air
Force's Project Blue Book

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
revisited the case and
concluded that the object

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
was a top secret Navy
skyhook balloon used

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:90%
to study cosmic rays.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:84%
However, it was under the
shadow cast by the tragedy

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that the members of the
Air Force's Project Sign

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
began their investigation
into flying saucers.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the winter and spring
of 1948 at Wright Patterson Air

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Force Base in building T2, they
began to grapple with the fact

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that whatever they were,
the saucers weren't

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
foreign or secret
domestic technology.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Investigators went
out into the field

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:84%
to quietly talk to
people, many of them

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.145 align:middle line:90%
military who had filed reports.

00:18:08.145 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
By March, they had over
300 made by observers

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:90%
they considered competent.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
By summer, a debate was
raging within the Sign team

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.981 align:middle line:84%
whether some of the objects
reported were extraterrestrial.

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Then one night in July,
an extraordinary incident

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:90%
unfolded.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The case that turned the
corner for Project Sign has

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
gone by the name of the
Chiles-Whitted case,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
out of the two airline pilots
that were the prime witnesses

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
in the case.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Eastern Airlines flight
576 was 20 miles south

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
of Montgomery, Alabama at 2:45
in the morning of July the 24th

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
when Captain Clarence S. Chiles
and first officer John B.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Whitted saw an elongated
wingless craft flash

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:84%
by their plane at what they
estimated as 700 miles an hour.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Both men describe the object
as metallic with two lighted

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:90%
rows of windows.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
On Pentagon instruction,
Sign investigators

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
hurriedly flew off to
interview Chiles and Whitted.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:84%
They were impressed with
the two men's certainty

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
that what they saw was
a manufactured object.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The Sign team was also
aware of a report the week

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
before from the Netherlands
of a similar two-tiered craft

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and other reports from across
Europe of wingless planes.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Within days of the
Chiles-Whitted sighting,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:84%
the Sign team had
committed to a conclusion.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason why Project
Sign saw this case as being

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial was that this
was an object flying freely

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and apparently maneuverably
in our environment that had no

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:90%
wings.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So where would the lift for
a piloted craft of some kind

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
What they knew as
technologists at Wright Patt

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
was the only way such
an object could fly

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.837 align:middle line:84%
is if it had a tremendously
powerful energy source.

00:20:18.837 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
they could think of

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:84%
would be something
like nuclear, but they

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
knew that they had
nothing nuclear

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:90%
and no one else did either.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
They were stuck
with a conclusion

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that this was an
extraterrestrial device.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:10%
>> As traffic backed up with
employees leaving Wright Patt

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the
midsummer workdays,

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:10%
the Sign team was hunkered down
writing what they must have

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:10%
seen as one of the most
important documents ever

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:10%
written.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:10%
It was an estimate of
the situation required

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:10%
of all military investigations
once they reach a conclusion.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
The estimate was then
sent to the Pentagon

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
where it circulated to
a very mixed reaction.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The majority of the people
in the Pentagon at the time

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
thought that this was not
a message that they wanted

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.930 align:middle line:84%
to send out into the world
or even into the military

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:84%
community itself, that this
was just too strange and too

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:90%
dangerous.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It was like a unknown
wild card that they

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to let
psychologically

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:90%
loose within their people.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The estimate worked its way
up to the desk of Air Force

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg,
who was, we can assume,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:90%
thrilled to see.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
As what he did with
the estimate is

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:84%
a crucial juncture
in this story,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
it's worthwhile to consider
his decision options.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
He could, one, reject the
estimate straight away

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and bury its conclusions,
two, order further study,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
which would serve to keep
its conclusions alive

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
with the possibility
of leaks, or, three,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
accept the conclusions,
which would

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
mean admitting to the
Congress, the president,

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and the American people
that the Air Force was

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
powerless to prevent
extraterrestrials

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
of unknown origin and,
worse, unknown intent

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.405 align:middle line:84%
from overflying
the United States.

00:22:09.405 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers who believe
that a flying saucer crashed

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
at Roswell are of the opinion
that Vandenberg's decision was

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:90%
made to perpetuate a cover up.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But Roswell is not
necessary to understand

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:90%
why the estimate was quashed.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Simple convenience suffices.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
The idea it advocated
was dangerous.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
The effect on the
population unpredictable.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Authority fears and loathes
one thing above all.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Vandenberg let it be
known to the Sign team

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:84%
that their conclusions had
no supporting evidence.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:84%
All copies of the estimate
were ordered destroyed.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:10%
The Sign team was
disbanded and replaced

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:10%
by Project Grudge,
whose mandate apparently

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:10%
was to give the public mundane
explanations for all sightings

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:10%
and shift the emphasis
from the reports

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.620 align:middle line:10%
to the people making them.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.695 align:middle line:84%
Flying saucers were to be
a psychological problem.

00:23:14.695 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.780 align:middle line:84%
In December of 1948,
just as Project Sign

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
was being replaced by the
saucers don't exist Project

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Grudge, a series
of sightings called

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
the green fireballs began
over sensitive military

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:90%
installations in New Mexico.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:10%
They were seen by dozens of
scientists at the Los Alamos

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:10%
Nuclear Research
Installation and by hundreds

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:10%
of military personnel.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
At least 39 reports were sent
to Grudge by April of '49.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
There was great concern in
the scientific community

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:90%
about what they were.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But Project Grudge,
true to its name,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.860 align:middle line:84%
seemed to begrudge all
requests to investigate.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:84%
A few months later, Grudge
cooperated with the Saturday

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Evening Post on a major two
part article debunking saucers,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
only to see
sightings immediately

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:90%
hit an all-time high.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Two days after the
article, a fateful telegram

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
arrived on the desk of a retired
Marine major and former aide

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to Charles Lindbergh, now
a successful journalist.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Have been investigating
flying saucer mystery.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
First tip hinted gigantic hopes
to cover up official secret.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Believe it may have been
planted to hide real answer.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Looks like terrific story.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you take over
Washington end?

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Ken W. Purdy, editor
True Magazine.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Initially skeptical, Donald
Keyhoe took the assignment

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and began six months
of research drawing

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
on his extensive
contacts in the military.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
The subject of flying saucers
would never be the same.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, through
the rest of 1949,

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
the team at Project
Grudge did their best

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to shoot down any
and all sightings.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
They were aided in their
mission by their new astronomer

consultant, J. Allen Hynek.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Hynek was very skeptical.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:84%
From the beginning, he
assumed that all reports

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.590 align:middle line:84%
were explainable in
conventional terms.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:10%
And that is, in
fact, what he did.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:10%
That was his function
for the Air Force.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:10%
They would take the
cases to him, say,

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:10%
we can't explain this.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:84%
We can't trace a
weather balloon.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Is this a comet, a
meteor, a planet?

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And Hynek would provide
the explanation.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Donald Keyhoe's True Magazine
article appeared just before

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:90%
New Year's 1950.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:84%
It was the largest selling
issue in the magazine's history.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:10%
>> This was a sensation.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.400 align:middle line:10%
This article got press
coverage all over the world.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Keyhoe concluded from
interviewing his Air Force

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
contacts, interviewing pilots,
other credible witnesses,

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that flying saucers
were coming to Earth,

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and they'd started watching us
intensely because they began

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:90%
monitoring our atomic bombs.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1950, men throughout
the world learned to look

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:90%
on the brutal face of communism.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:84%
The pictures that Paul
Trent and his wife took

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:84%
would be among the most highly
analyzed UFO photos ever taken.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And while there have
been many attempts

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
to expose them as
faked, the efforts

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:90%
have been far from convincing.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was also the lifelong
character of the Trents.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody says,
straightforward, honest.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The chance of them making
up a hoax like this is zero.

August in Great Falls, Montana,

Nick Mariana, the general
manager of the city's baseball

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:84%
team, shot some 16 millimeter
film of what he described

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:90%
as two silent disk like objects.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Mariana showed the film
around town numerous times,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
including at club meetings
at the Park Hotel.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:84%

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:84%
of the club, later to
become the team's announcer,

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.010 align:middle line:90%
remembers being at a screening.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Good view.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:10%
Shiny, saucer shaped things.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Though his recall is
spotty after five decades,

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:10%
like others who saw the film,
what impressed him was how they

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:10%
were stationary disks that
took off at a great speed.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Hovering.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Standing still?

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But as he's standing
there holding the camera,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.952 align:middle line:84%
they all just started
to go up, very slowly,

00:27:56.952 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and then went shew.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> In September, the Air Force
heard about the film and asked

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Mariana for the footage.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:90%
He was happy to oblige.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.780 align:middle line:84%
In October, Project
Grudge announced

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
their photo analysts
were unable to find

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:90%
anything of an unusual nature.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Mariana, in a huff,
asked for his film back.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.090 align:middle line:84%
When it was returned,
he claimed the first 35

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:90%
frames were missing.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The frames he and others
who'd seen the film

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:30.020 align:middle line:84%
said that clearly showed two
spinning disk-like objects.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force denied the
frames were tampered with.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Mariana pointed
to a splice where

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.190 align:middle line:90%
the leader joined the film.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.305 align:middle line:90%
His splicer was perpendicular.

00:28:39.305 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The splice at the head
of the film was diagonal.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:84%
The missing frames,
if Mariana and others

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
were telling the truth, have
never surfaced to this day.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:10%
Around the same time
the Grudge was publicly

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:10%
dismissing the Mariana
film, a foreigner

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:10%
was visiting Washington with
flying saucers on his mind.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:10%
Wilbert Brockhouse Smith,
a senior radio engineer

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:10%
at the Canadian
Department of Transport

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:10%
was attending a conference.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Smith was doing research
into geomagnetism

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and had been interested
in flying saucers

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.910 align:middle line:90%
from the first reports in 1947.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.660 align:middle line:84%
According to a confidential
memo to his transport superiors

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
that was discovered
in the late '70s,

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Smith made discreet inquiries
through the Canadian embassy

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:84%
to a high ranking US Defense
Research Board scientist

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Doctor Robert I. Sarbacher.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
The memo described
what he learned.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:84%
The matter is the most
highly classified subject

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
government, rating higher even

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:90%
than the H bomb.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Flying saucers exist and their
modus operandi is unknown,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:84%
but concentrated effort is being
made by a small group headed

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.720 align:middle line:90%
by Doctor Vannevar Bush.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:10%
The entire matter is
considered by the United States

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.830 align:middle line:10%
authorities to be of
tremendous significance.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Smith received permission from
the Department of Transport

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to set up a flying
saucer detection

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
unit at the Shirley's Bay
installation just north

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:90%
of Ottawa.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
The unit was shut down a
few years later not having

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:90%
had any success.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But Smith's memo would
become of huge importance

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
when it came to light
in the late '70s.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
It appeared to confirm
the existence of a crash

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
recovered saucer and an
above top secret control

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:84%
group, ideas that
would loom large

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.815 align:middle line:84%
in the UFO landscape of
the '80s and the '90s.

00:30:41.815 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.280 align:middle line:84%
1951 would be a slow
year for saucers.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But a striking multiple
radar and visual case

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
over the New Jersey coast
involved the local Air Force

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Base at Fort Monmouth.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Project Grudge was now moribund.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And the commanding officer
sloughed off the incident

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:90%
calling it radar artifacts.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:84%
When this came to
light at the Pentagon,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.810 align:middle line:90%
it caused a major stink.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Major General Charles
Cabell, the head of Air Force

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence, went ballistic.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.390 align:middle line:10%
>> And he stormed around
pointing at various people who

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:10%
were also there in
his audience saying,

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I've been lied to and
lied to and lied to.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:84%
He says, I demand that this
subject be taken seriously.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Cabell had Grudge reorganized
under more open minded officers

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and renamed Project Blue Book.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And at that time, probably
the most sympathetic Blue Book

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:84%
chief at Wright Patterson
Air Force Base was installed.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was Captain
Edward Ruppelt.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Ed Ruppelt was an
aeronautical engineer

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.670 align:middle line:90%
and a good organizer.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
More importantly, he
had a sense of history.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Much of what we know
about the early years

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.140 align:middle line:84%
comes from the book he wrote
when he left the service.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Around the same time
the winds of change

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:84%
were blowing through
the Pentagon,

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:84%
"The Day the Earth Stood
Still" was released.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Directed by Robert Wise,
the message of the film

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
was as old as the New Testament
complete with crucifixion,

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:84%
a robotically
assisted resurrection,

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and a pointed sermon
from the mount.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I came here to
give you these facts.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.170 align:middle line:84%
It is no concern of ours
how you run your own planet.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you threaten to
extend your violence,

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.170 align:middle line:84%
this Earth of yours will be
reduced to a burned out cinder.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The film was the flip side
of the message in another A-list

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.160 align:middle line:84%
movie of that year, Howard
Hawks' "The Thing From Another

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:90%
World."

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Spread out everybody.

00:32:53.465 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to figure
out the shape of this thing.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Where an alien monster lies
frozen under the Arctic ice

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.458 align:middle line:84%
waiting for the naive
humans to come by.

00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:05.434 align:middle line:90%
>> It's round.

00:33:05.434 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> We finally got one.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
We found a flying saucer.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Thus begins Hollywood's
projection of flying saucers

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.700 align:middle line:84%
onto the ancient
myth of the other,

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.010 align:middle line:84%
the stranger who mirrors our
deepest hopes and our most

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.300 align:middle line:84%
terrifying fears, a myth that
would continue to play itself

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:84%

Lead us--

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:10%
>> If the history of
UFOs has movements,

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:10%
each with its own dramatic
arc, the year 1952 would be

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.210 align:middle line:10%
the climax of the opening act.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The tumultuous events would
set the course of the history

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.980 align:middle line:90%
for the next 15 years.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) And
lead us on to love.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In the spring, Life Magazine
openly wondered if we have

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:06.209 align:middle line:84%
visitors from space and became
as talked about as the 1950

00:34:06.209 --> 00:34:07.009 align:middle line:90%
True article.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:10.159 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
The New York Times, hostile to
the whole idea from the start,

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
sneered that the subject had as
much reality as the Loch Ness

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.685 align:middle line:90%
Monster.

00:34:19.685 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:10%
And the first debunker appeared.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Donald Menzel was a
prestigious Harvard astronomer

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.010 align:middle line:84%
who employed all his political
and media connections

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:84%
to discourage anyone from
taking the subject seriously.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:10%
>> He had enough cachet as
a Harvard astronomer to get

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:10%
into Time Magazine and places
like that with his idea that it

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:10%
was all oddball radar
reflections and plasma effects

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:10%
and a bunch of
misinterpreted nonsense.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Ed Ruppelt,
Menzel and his strained

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:58.120 align:middle line:84%
explanations garnered little
more than contempt at Air Force

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They had their hands full
with the practical problem.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The great saucer wave of
1952 had broken in June

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.120 align:middle line:84%
sending everyone
scurrying to keep up.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Reports for the month totaled
144, the highest number ever.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.630 align:middle line:84%
July would more
than triple that.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:21.300 align:middle line:84%
On July 14th, the
pilot and co-pilot

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.240 align:middle line:84%
of a Pan Am flight off
the coast of Virginia

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:84%
watched six bright orange disks
flying in a line, flip on edge,

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:84%
get joined in their echelon
by another two disks,

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and disappear off
into the distance

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:84%
at a speed they clocked at
an astounding 12,000 miles

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.790 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Donald Menzel would toss out
many explanations for the Nash

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Fortenberry incident.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
That old standby
meteors was one.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
irony that the scientists

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:84%
of the 18th century
couldn't accept that rocks

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:90%
could fall from the sky.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Menzel also suggested
searchlights playing on clouds.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Although a quick check of
the weather would have shown

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.880 align:middle line:90%
it was a cloudless night.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Then he tossed out
reflections in the cockpit

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:84%
glass of lighted cigarettes
in the passenger cabin.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And finally, in what may have
been a stretch for the ages,

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:84%
fireflies trapped between the
windshield panes of glass.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But the Nash
Fortenberry incident

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
was just a harbinger of what was
to come less than a week later

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:84%
with a series of events
that would completely change

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.803 align:middle line:90%
the history of the phenomena.

00:36:36.803 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The midsummer of '52 was
when everything changed.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking about
massive wave of sightings.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were getting 20
or more sightings per day.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They are flying all up
and down the East coast.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:10%
And some people actually
predicted, because of the way

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:10%
they were doing it,
that they would probably

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:10%
show up in Washington DC.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And there, in the middle
of July, they did.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> A cluster of seven blips 10
miles southwest of the capital

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:18.640 align:middle line:84%
was first noticed at 11:40 PM
Saturday July 19th on the long

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.630 align:middle line:84%
range radar at Washington
National Airport.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:26.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the operators looked out
and saw a bright orange light.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:84%
When the blips started showing
up over the White House,

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Harry Barnes, the senior
traffic controller,

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:84%
called Andrews Air Force
Base 10 miles to the east.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.720 align:middle line:84%
An Andrews controller was soon
seeing bright orange objects

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:90%
flashing through the sky.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
As the runways at Andrews
were under repair,

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
jets would have to be dispatched
from Newcastle Air Force Base

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:90%
30 minutes away in Delaware.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, a Capital Airlines
flight taking off from National

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:84%
was vectored towards some
radar blips to the west.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
As they approached the area,
they saw nothing unusual.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, a bluish white
light flashed in front of them

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:90%
on a 25 degree dive.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Then another one
shot from behind them

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:90%
zooming up and out of sight.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:84%
In the next seven minutes,
they watched seven more lights

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:21.570 align:middle line:84%
all being simultaneously tracked
on the radar back at National.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The most spectacular
incident happened

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:26.080 align:middle line:84%
when National tower
informed Andrews

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that they had a target
right over the base.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:84%
The operators looked out and
saw huge a fiery orange sphere.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.060 align:middle line:84%
When the jets finally
arrived from Delaware,

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
all the blips disappeared
only to return

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.160 align:middle line:90%
when the jets departed.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Harry Barnes would later
tell the newspapers

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:84%
that he felt the
targets were somehow

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:90%
aware of their communications.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> A little dance went
on for a couple of times.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:90%
And it boggled everybody's mind.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
The night of Saturday July
19th, dramatic though it was,

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:90%
would just be the warm up act.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.200 align:middle line:10%
The following Saturday at
9:30, both radars at Washington

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.420 align:middle line:10%
National and the one
at Andrews started

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:10.450 align:middle line:10%
getting returns as
visual sightings poured

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.360 align:middle line:10%
in from all over the area.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Al Chop, the public
information officer

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:19.320 align:middle line:84%
at the Pentagon for UFOs who
was a confirmed skeptic when

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.150 align:middle line:84%
he started the job, was
called out to the tower

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.990 align:middle line:84%
at Washington
National at midnight.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:84%
There was total confusion
as reports of objects

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:90%
were coming in droves.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of the radar blips
were solid, some less so.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:84%
One airline pilot, after
making multiple passes

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.640 align:middle line:84%
over the spot he'd
been vectored to,

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.680 align:middle line:84%
concluded the target was a
river boat plying the Potomac.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Two jets had arrived earlier.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, the objects
had disappeared.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Now a Chop was present,
a second pair arrived.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:84%
One was vectored to an area 10
miles out of the city, which

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.740 align:middle line:90%
showed radar targets.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:84%
As he approached, he
described four white globes

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and began to close in for a
much anticipated intercept.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But as Chop and the controllers
watched on the scope,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.380 align:middle line:84%
the object shot right at
the jet and surrounded it.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:84%
According to Chop,
the pilot radioed them

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.630 align:middle line:84%
for instructions asking,
what do I do now?

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.430 align:middle line:90%


00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Then the glowing
orbs zipped off.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
After that, Al Chop was no
longer a skeptic about UFOs.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Monday's banner headline
in the Washington Post

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:84%
caused mounting concern
of a public panic.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:84%
On Tuesday morning, the largest
and longest Air Force press

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:84%
conference since the Second
World War took place.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The brass, all carefree
smiles, suggested

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.710 align:middle line:84%
that a temperature
inversion could

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.840 align:middle line:84%
have caused the radars
to pick up ground

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.230 align:middle line:90%
vehicles as airborne objects.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.260 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the
media ran with this.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:10%
But behind the walls of the
Pentagon in the offices of Air

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.770 align:middle line:10%
Force Intelligence,
all explanations

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.430 align:middle line:10%
were still very
much on the table.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.260 align:middle line:84%
During the height of
the flap, Ed Ruppelt

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
had taken a call from
Harry Truman's military aid

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.580 align:middle line:84%
General Robert P. Landry
demanding answers.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And he told them that they
didn't know what they had

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:90%
on their hands.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, it took Harry
Truman one day

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to order Landry to go to the
Joint Intelligence Committee

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and to order a study of this.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Aside from the question
of what had just happened,

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.240 align:middle line:84%
the Washington flap had caused a
major communications breakdown.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The hysteria, the jamming of
the telephone lines where you

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.890 align:middle line:90%
couldn't even call the Pentagon.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> When the request at the Joint
Intelligence Committee came

00:41:54.370 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:84%
down to take a look at UFOs, the
logical place for that request

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:07.810 align:middle line:84%
to be studied was some agency
other than the one studying it

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:84%
already, which
was the Air Force.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.933 align:middle line:90%
And so, they picked the CIA.

00:42:13.933 --> 00:42:16.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Fred Durant, a
rocket engineer,

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:20.170 align:middle line:10%
was in the CIA's Office of
Scientific Intelligence.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.210 align:middle line:10%
>> The ball was handed to me.

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Did the CIA have concerns
about the competence of Blue

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:26.650 align:middle line:10%
Book?

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as competence, well,
it was obvious it do not have

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.000 align:middle line:84%
professional competency
above an engineer.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> While Ruppelt was an
aeronautical engineer,

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
he was just a lowly
reserve lieutenant.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And his understaffed
little project

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.290 align:middle line:84%
was now in the glaring spotlight
of the entire Cold War security

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:90%
apparatus.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Durant and his cohorts from
the CIA went to Wright Patt

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:84%
to examine Blue
Book's methodology.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.320 align:middle line:84%
After sniffing around,
the CIA decided

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to have a scientific panel
to evaluate the Air Force

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.170 align:middle line:90%
evidence.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> CIA wanted to keep this
as an internal project,

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:84%
which they had
complete control over.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So rather than going to a
good high tech science group,

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.320 align:middle line:84%
out of which we
might have gotten

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.170 align:middle line:84%
a rather nice estimate again
of what the phenomenon was,

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
what happened was that they went
to internal CIA consultants.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The most well-known
of which, and a person

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.350 align:middle line:84%
who had been chief consulting
scientist for the CIA

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:40.030 align:middle line:84%
in the past, was a guy named
Doctor Bob Robertson, H.P.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Robertson, a nuclear
scientist, more or less

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.350 align:middle line:90%
a mathematician from Cal Tech.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The Robertson panel met
in secret over four days

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.240 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of January 1953
and spent a total of 12 hours

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.140 align:middle line:84%
reviewing in depth only eight
cases of the hundreds that Blue

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Book had on file as unknowns.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:84%
As an example of
their in-depth review,

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:84%
they concluded that
the Great Falls Montana

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.780 align:middle line:84%
film taken by Nick
Mariana was of two fighter

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:84%
jets in the area, this, despite
Mariana's claim he observed

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.320 align:middle line:90%
the jets a few minutes later.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And had Ruppelt's
reinvestigation

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that concluded the planes
were nowhere as near Mariana

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.820 align:middle line:90%
as the objects on the film.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The Robertson panel
report was basically there

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.070 align:middle line:84%
for everybody to
sign the next day.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:10%
And it had already been passed
to the chief of Air Force

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.160 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence for his approval.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The Robertson panel concluded
that as reasonable explanations

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.070 align:middle line:10%
could be suggested
for most sightings,

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:46.030 align:middle line:10%
all sightings might be
explained in a similar manner.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:10%
It also recommended that to
eliminate national security

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:10%
communications problems and the
communists using UFO hysteria

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:57.040 align:middle line:10%
to their advantage that
the subject be debunked

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.740 align:middle line:10%
and ridiculed, so the
public would no longer

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.630 align:middle line:10%
take it seriously.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If you wanted to eliminate a
national security problem with

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.610 align:middle line:84%
this, you needed to change the
attitude of the American public

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:90%
to this phenomena.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only effective
way of doing that

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.230 align:middle line:90%
was to make it be a joke.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:22.810 align:middle line:84%
There was no science in this
science committee report.

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
national security.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The world's
first hydrogen bomb,

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.950 align:middle line:84%
housed in this
barn like building,

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.320 align:middle line:84%
was to be exploded on
a tiny target island.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> In the wake of the Robertson
panel's recommendations,

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book
was repurposed.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Its funding shrank.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And Ruppelt soon
left the service.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Blue Book continued,
but its role now

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be to carry
out the Robertson panel's

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:90%
recommendations and debunk UFOs.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Behind the walls
of the Pentagon,

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:57.040 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial debate
at the top levels of Air Force

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence petered out.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.390 align:middle line:84%
The Washington flap
had rattled the windows

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:84%
in the corridors of
power and raised concerns

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:10.660 align:middle line:84%
about public hysteria in the
perilous times of the Cold War.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.570 align:middle line:84%
A brief period of open
inquiry had come to an end,

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:19.838 align:middle line:84%
and a dark curtain of denial
had once again descended.

00:46:19.838 --> 00:46:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) See the
USA in your Chevrolet.

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.430 align:middle line:90%
America' asking you to call.

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> By the early '50s, even
with a new administration

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, it was evident
that any revelations about

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:37.560 align:middle line:84%
the UFO mystery would not be
forthcoming from government.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And civilian
investigation groups

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.350 align:middle line:84%
were started up by people
who wanted answers.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But the day was also
dawning on people

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:51.260 align:middle line:84%
who claimed to already know
the answers, the contactees.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.070 align:middle line:84%
In 1952, a man born
in Poland named

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:57.670 align:middle line:84%
George Adamski had walked
out into the Mojave Desert

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and met Orthon, a man born on
Venus or so Adamski claimed.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And many thousands
would believe him.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It didn't take very long once
people started seeing flying

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.330 align:middle line:10%
saucers to present stories
that saviors were actually

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.570 align:middle line:10%
descending from the sky, which
is where saviors usually come

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.280 align:middle line:10%
from anyway.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, they came
in a technological form

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.700 align:middle line:90%
in a spaceship.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Georgia Adamski's
visiting aliens

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:32.530 align:middle line:84%
incorporated so much angelic
imagery that it's obvious.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> As his fame grew, Adamski was
soon joined by others claiming

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.520 align:middle line:84%
physical and telepathic
contact with the space brothers

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and sisters and writing books
about their joy rides with them

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.690 align:middle line:90%
to other planets.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.180 align:middle line:84%
1954 saw their first
convention at Giant Rock

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.360 align:middle line:90%
in the Mojave Desert.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.290 align:middle line:10%
The contactee
movement was a feast

00:47:55.290 --> 00:48:00.820 align:middle line:10%
for the media, an easy
snack of assorted nuts.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This tended to confirm
the suspicions of many

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that there was nothing to
flying saucers of any substance.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.850 align:middle line:10%
Among the serious
UFO research groups,

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:10%
the need was seen for a
high profile organization

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:17.060 align:middle line:10%
in Washington DC to lobby
Congress and press for hearings

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:17.860 align:middle line:10%
into UFOs.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.430 align:middle line:10%


00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:23.710 align:middle line:10%
The National Investigations
Committee on Aerial Phenomena

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:28.860 align:middle line:10%
or NICAP was formed in 1956.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It was soon being directed
by that UFO crusader Donald

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Keyhoe.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:39.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Keyhoe was a
master at publicity.

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.110 align:middle line:10%
He was good on radio.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.730 align:middle line:10%
He was good on television.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.260 align:middle line:84%
He had a certain kind
of personal charisma.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.510 align:middle line:90%
He was intensely sincere.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.970 align:middle line:84%
He attracted all kinds of people
with solid professional and

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:55.055 align:middle line:84%
middle class
credentials to lobby

00:48:55.055 --> 00:48:56.180 align:middle line:90%
for congressional hearings.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.970 align:middle line:90%


00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, a new
moon is in the sky.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The Soviet launch of Sputnik
shocked America and ushered

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:09.990 align:middle line:84%
in the 1957 wave, notable for
the many close range vehicle

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:15.570 align:middle line:84%
interference cases and
reports of landed craft.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.550 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the
decade, the numbers

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:21.840 align:middle line:84%
at the contactee conventions
at Giant Rock were dwindling.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.120 align:middle line:10%
But the bright eyed
naivete of the '50s

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.980 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't come to
a definitive end

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:30.750 align:middle line:10%
until the events of
November the 22nd, 1963.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Dark forces now seemed to
be lurking in the shadows,

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and they underscored
the four year UFO wave

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.900 align:middle line:90%
that began the same year.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Visual sightings of
distant UFOs were

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:47.820 align:middle line:84%
about to become up
close and personal.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.390 align:middle line:84%
In mid-decade, one such strange
and disturbing encounter

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.980 align:middle line:90%
came to light.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It would gain even
greater significance

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.870 align:middle line:84%
two decades later
because it involved

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:02.470 align:middle line:84%
missing time, hypnotically
recovered memories

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.250 align:middle line:84%
of being abducted, and
the taking of samples

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.530 align:middle line:84%
from the human
reproductive system.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.950 align:middle line:10%
>> In a way, it's really
extraordinarily important

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:15.610 align:middle line:10%
for the fact that it
laid down the terms,

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:10%
although they didn't
know that at the time,

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.100 align:middle line:10%
for what the shape the
phenomenon was about to take.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Betty and Barney Hill,
returning from a vacation

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.230 align:middle line:84%
through the White
Mountains of New Hampshire,

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.830 align:middle line:84%
had seen a UFO following
them at close range.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Inexplicably, they arrived
home three hours late.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Betty called her
sister and niece over

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:39.880 align:middle line:84%
to see some strange things
that had occurred that night.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:46.030 align:middle line:10%
>> The tops of Barney's
shoes were deeply gouged.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:50.530 align:middle line:10%
We saw the watches that had
stopped working that night.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We saw the highly magnetic
spots, very shiny spots

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.540 align:middle line:90%
on the trunk of the car.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> In separate
hypnosis sessions,

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.850 align:middle line:84%
a terrifying ordeal was recalled
where the couple was taken

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:08.345 align:middle line:84%
aboard a craft and subjected
to something like examinations.

00:51:08.345 --> 00:51:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> A needle was
put in her navel.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.385 align:middle line:84%
They told her it was some
sort of pregnancy test.

00:51:14.385 --> 00:51:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And a sperm sample
was definitely

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.070 align:middle line:84%
taken from Barnney Hill
even though that was not

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.880 align:middle line:84%
mentioned in the book, because
it was seen as unseemly.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:25.570 align:middle line:10%
>> One story just not
a phenomenon make.

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:10%
And what you're looking
for, of course, is patterns.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And with Barney
and Betty Hill, we

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.490 align:middle line:84%
didn't quite know how to
approach it, how to study it,

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.930 align:middle line:84%
how to understand
what was happening.

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> As strange as it was,
the Hills' incident was just

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:44.100 align:middle line:84%
an inexplicable blip on
the UFO map of the decade.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:47.130 align:middle line:10%
If the mid '60s wave
had a climactic event,

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.310 align:middle line:10%
it was the infamous
swamp gas incident.

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:54.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Not that it was the
most fabulous of UFO cases,

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:58.380 align:middle line:10%
but it occurred at sort of an
emotional peak that had a lot

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:03.480 align:middle line:10%
of momentum to it as far as
the public was concerned.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> In March of '66, a localized
wave had hit southern Michigan

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.690 align:middle line:90%
lasting over a week.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
In one of the more
spectacular incidents,

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:84%
40 people, including
a dozen policemen,

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.660 align:middle line:84%
chased after something
flying around a swamp.

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And less than a mile
away over this field,

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.830 align:middle line:84%
a patrolman reported a
low flying object approach

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:26.780 align:middle line:90%
and zip 10 feet above his car.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was what
happened the next night

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.790 align:middle line:84%
at a girls' dormitory at
Hillsdale College that

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:35.560 align:middle line:90%
sparked a media frenzy.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of an evening,
87 coeds, their dorm mother,

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and a civil defense
director watched something

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.890 align:middle line:84%
closely resembling what
the policemen saw zip

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:47.670 align:middle line:90%
around the arboretum out back.

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:50.080 align:middle line:90%
First to spot it was Jo Wilson.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.230 align:middle line:84%
She called her roommate
Sarah Robechek to the window.

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>> There were three lights.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And this one was bigger
than the other two.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And it pulsated from
white through yellow

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:01.540 align:middle line:90%
to orange to red and back.

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anything move that fast.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Did it have any sound?

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:06.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Not that we could hear.

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't remember
any sound that night.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:08.500 align:middle line:10%
>> It was very quiet.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:10.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was a mild spring night.

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.520 align:middle line:90%
It was very mild and cold.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>> What happens the next day?

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:19.640 align:middle line:10%
>> CBS, ABC, and NBC fly
into Hillsdale, Michigan.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, they loved
that, didn't they?

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I do know when we got
back to our room that day,

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:29.420 align:middle line:10%
there was a CBS camera man
with his giant camera sitting

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.630 align:middle line:10%
on my desk with the camera
pointing out to the arb saying

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:34.370 align:middle line:10%
he was staying all night.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:37.820 align:middle line:10%
And a TV camera
back then was huge.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Blue Book sent Allen Hynek
into the fray to deal with

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the media and to
find an explanation.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> On the basis of a very brief,
literally over the phone piece

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:84%
of information, and sort of an
accident where he was talking

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.630 align:middle line:84%
to a friend from the
scientific community of his,

00:53:56.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:middle line:84%
this friend wondered about
the possibility of swamp gas

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:08.000 align:middle line:84%
as being ignited and showing
kind of a bulbous glowing ball

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that people unfamiliar with
it might be confused by.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And Allen, not to
his great credit,

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.800 align:middle line:84%
decided that that's what he
was going to go with on this.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And he came out in
public with the idea

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:22.745 align:middle line:84%
that this was a
swamp gas phenomenon.

00:54:22.745 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Where we were looking,
there was no swamp.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It was an arboretum,
for goodness sakes.

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> The arboretum, yeah.

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> They would go in
there and prune and mow.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:31.820 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.770 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't swampy.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> He stuck his
foot in his mouth.

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And people didn't let
him get away with it.

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And people were railing on
him across the whole country

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:84%
right on up to Congress
and Jerry Ford,

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:84%
who was speaker of
the House at that

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:51.590 align:middle line:84%
time and a rather important
man who felt that his Michigan

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:55.070 align:middle line:84%
constituency had been
publicly embarrassed

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:57.590 align:middle line:84%
by this so-called
government employee.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to know
how that had happened.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Jerry Ford called for the
long sought after congressional

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.500 align:middle line:90%
hearing into UFOs.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It took place over one day
in front of the House Armed

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Services Committee.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Highly embarrassed with
the stigma of swamp gas,

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Allen Hynek joined
those calling for

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.910 align:middle line:84%
an independent scientific
study of the problem.

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force readily
agreed and offered

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to fund it, which
probably should

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.570 align:middle line:90%
have raised a cautionary flag.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.930 align:middle line:10%
But among the civilian
investigation groups,

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.560 align:middle line:10%
there was euphoria.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It appeared there
would finally be

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.170 align:middle line:90%
an independent scientific study.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:37.510 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:41.110 align:middle line:84%
In the wake of the
1966 swamp gas fiasco,

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.170 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force approached a
number of A-list universities

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:48.010 align:middle line:84%
to conduct a serious
scientific study of UFOs

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:50.050 align:middle line:90%
and was turned down flat.

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.030 align:middle line:10%
Finally, the
University of Colorado,

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:55.960 align:middle line:10%
running low on federal grant
money, considered accepting.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Heading the study would be
the respected physicist Edward

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Condon.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Edward Condon didn't want
do this for the Air Force,

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.980 align:middle line:84%
even though he'd done a lot
of military consultancy work

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:84%
before because he was like most
other people in the scientific

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:12.510 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:15.780 align:middle line:84%
He thought the whole thing was
nonsense, not worth his time.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But University of Colorado
needed some money.

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Lowe, the person who
would administer the project,

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.690 align:middle line:84%
pitched it to one of the
university trustees thusly.

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The trick would
be, to the public,

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:31.770 align:middle line:84%
it would appear a
totally objective study.

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But to the scientific
community, it

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:36.930 align:middle line:84%
would present the image
of a group of nonbelievers

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:38.910 align:middle line:84%
trying to be
objective but having

00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:43.390 align:middle line:84%
an almost zero expectation
of finding a saucer.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was Bob Lowe,
the used car salesman,

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.650 align:middle line:84%
saying what he had to to the
board of trustees to relax

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:54.120 align:middle line:84%
them, so they could put their
imprimatur on the project.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> When discovered later, the
memo would have disastrous

00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.780 align:middle line:84%
consequences and convinced
the civilian research groups

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:04.170 align:middle line:84%
who'd enthusiastically
cooperated up to that point

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.480 align:middle line:90%
that a fix was in.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.570 align:middle line:84%
It turned out they were right
but not because of the Lowe

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.180 align:middle line:90%
memo.

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.040 align:middle line:84%
As the study was
getting underway,

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Condon and Lowe met with
their Air Force liaison.

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, they
asked him what result

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.020 align:middle line:90%
the Air Force would like.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.330 align:middle line:84%
The leaders of what's
supposed to be an inquiry

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:28.160 align:middle line:84%
into the reality of UFOs asking
for direction from the agency

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.710 align:middle line:84%
who'd been proclaiming
for two decades

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:35.420 align:middle line:84%
that there was absolutely no
reality to them whatsoever.

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.970 align:middle line:84%
The liaison officer
replied that the Air Force

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:40.910 align:middle line:84%
was tired of funding
project Blue Book.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And what he
says to Condon is,

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.760 align:middle line:84%
this project has been a source
of a lot of irritation really

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:84%
to the Air Force and
a lot of expanse.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And we really need
to get rid of this.

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you find that you
don't have enough money

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:02.370 align:middle line:84%
to come to a proper
conclusion, reapply,

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:03.600 align:middle line:90%
and you'll get more money.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The Colorado study brought
onboard a team of eight

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:11.970 align:middle line:84%
scientists, engineers,
and psychologists.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Alan Hynek consulted
as did Keyhoe and NICAP

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and an atmospheric physicist
from the University

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.450 align:middle line:90%
of Arizona, Dr. James McDonald.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1954, he had a UFO
sighting in what we would call

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:26.910 align:middle line:90%
a daylight disk.

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was really a
very puzzling sighting,

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:32.880 align:middle line:84%
a good sighting, obviously
a very good trained witness.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't do
anything with it,

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:38.760 align:middle line:84%
because he was starting
his scientific career.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.220 align:middle line:10%
>> In the mid '60s,
McDonald picked up the study

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.290 align:middle line:10%
of the phenomenon
with a vengeance,

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.020 align:middle line:10%
reading through all the Blue
Book files and the extensive

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.850 align:middle line:10%
public literature.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> He went through all of
this in a period of months,

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:55.230 align:middle line:84%
began talking with witnesses,
was really impressed with

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:56.250 align:middle line:90%
the quality of evidence.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that this
was the most important

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:01.680 align:middle line:84%
overlooked scientific
question of the century, maybe

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.220 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
of the millennium.

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> McDonal was fearless,
vocal, and tireless.

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>> He began giving
hundreds of talks.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And I mean hundreds of talks.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:17.040 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of scientists in
these prestigious organizations

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:22.110 align:middle line:10%
began to take an open interest
in the subject of UFOs.

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.020 align:middle line:10%
>> But even as McDonald was
raising awareness in the wider

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.800 align:middle line:10%
scientific community, the
Colorado study researchers were

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.940 align:middle line:10%
learning how unusually unaware
Edward Condon appeared to be.

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.360 align:middle line:10%
>> He couldn't understand why
people were so upset that he

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.970 align:middle line:10%
had talked about trying to
debunk the UFO phenomenon.

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, to most
people, that sounds

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:45.540 align:middle line:84%
like somebody that's
already got his mind made up

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and how can we discredit it.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Still hoping for
an objective study,

00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the Colorado researchers went
into the field to investigate

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:57.480 align:middle line:84%
both old classic incidents and
some new ones as they cropped

00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.450 align:middle line:84%
up during the
course of the study.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:03.870 align:middle line:10%
One such case was the Falcon
Lake Manitoba incident,

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:07.320 align:middle line:10%
where a weekend prospector
named Stefan Michalak told

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.440 align:middle line:10%
of how he had approached
a landed disk thinking

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.020 align:middle line:10%
it was an American
test craft in trouble.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.700 align:middle line:10%
>> He saw two of them.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.780 align:middle line:84%
One stayed in the sky and
then headed off to the north.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And the other one landed over
there on that rock outcropping.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
He progressed and walked up to
the door of this thing, which

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
was situated
somewhere about here,

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and put his hand on
the side of the door,

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and poked his head in, saw
that there were some flashing

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.290 align:middle line:84%
lights like on a computer,
saw that his hand, his glove

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:45.760 align:middle line:90%
was melted very, very hot.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, he had
already shouted in, come on,

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Yankee boys, need some help?

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Let me help you
fix your machine.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.450 align:middle line:90%
And the voices stopped.

01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:58.920 align:middle line:10%
At this point, the
doors on this thing

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.400 align:middle line:10%
slid shut, kind of like an iris.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And the entire
object rotated, so

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that there was a grille
or exhaust vent right

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:09.690 align:middle line:90%
in front of him.

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And as he stood right close
to it, a blast of hot gas

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
shot out, knocking
him down, and then

01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
actually setting
some of his clothes

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:22.800 align:middle line:90%
on fire with the intense heat.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And the object took
off, rose into the air.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And because he was
disoriented and distracted,

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't tell which
direction it went.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But he spent some time rolling
on the ground putting out

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
his clothes, taking them off.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.250 align:middle line:90%


01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the ordeal of
getting back to civilization

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:46.060 align:middle line:84%
began, because he was
feeling very nauseous,

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.960 align:middle line:90%
very, very disoriented.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Michalak staggered out of the
bush and got back to Winnipeg

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.030 align:middle line:90%
extremely sick.

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:55.150 align:middle line:10%
And I remember going
into their bedroom.

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And even before I stepped
in over the threshold,

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:02.970 align:middle line:10%
the smell in the house and the
smell coming from the bedroom

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:05.200 align:middle line:10%
was horrible.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
But for days afterwards,
the smell lingered.

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And the more I visited with
him, the more we chatted,

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:15.580 align:middle line:84%
the more it felt as though the
smell was coming out of him,

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that he was exuding this
stink, that it was pouring out

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.330 align:middle line:90%
of his pores.

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:22.900 align:middle line:10%
>> He also had some
fainting spells.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.870 align:middle line:10%
He had a recurring
skin condition

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:28.540 align:middle line:10%
as a result and some
burning to his legs

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.770 align:middle line:10%
too, because when
he fell backwards,

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:33.760 align:middle line:10%
the blast also caught
him on the legs.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Two weeks later, Roy Craig,
a Colorado study chemist,

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
accompanied Michalak,
a "Life" photographer,

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and Canadian authorities in
a journey out to the site.

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
They found it suspicious that
Michalak couldn't find the rock

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
outcrop where he claimed the
encounter had taken place.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
There was also a forest
ranger tower a mile away,

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and the ranger hadn't noticed
anything unusual in the air.

01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
For these reasons, Roy
Craig dismissed the incident

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.000 align:middle line:90%
as a hoax.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But in the following
months and years,

01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Michalak's health
suffered immensely

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
from no diagnosable cause.

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
That, and the
official skepticism,

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
affected him for the
remainder of his life.

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What bothered him most
was being let down by all

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of the people he turned to
and said, this happened to me.

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he got,
well, we're not sure.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You burned yourself
on a barbecue.

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.590 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Meanwhile, back at the
University of Colorado,

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Condon was spending little
time with the project.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Instead of doing any
field investigation,

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
he was enjoying the
company of contactees

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and regaling his
professional colleagues

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
with their absurd tales.

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
When Jim McDonald gave a
seminar in the summer of '67,

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Condon fell asleep twice.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
That same summer, Roy Craig
happened upon Lowe's trick memo

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
in the files, the one written
to sell the university

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:03.520 align:middle line:90%
trustees on the project.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Disturbed, Craig showed it
to Norman Levine and David

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Saunders, two of
the project's staff

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
who were most bothered
by Condon's behavior.

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Saunders showed
it to Keyhoe, who

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:17.400 align:middle line:84%
gave it to Jim McDonald, who
mentioned it in a long letter

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to Lowe about the negative
direction the project seemed

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:22.260 align:middle line:90%
to be taking.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Bob Lowe was very,
very worried about this.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But Ed Condon, typically of
him, was explosive about it.

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
He considered this
to be an issue

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
of betrayal on the
part of what should

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:38.220 align:middle line:90%
be a private in-house team.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And he called David Saunders
and Norman Levine in,

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:43.070 align:middle line:90%
and he just fired them.

01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And he not only fired them, but
he told them that if he could,

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
he would ruin their
academic careers over this.

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> As threats of suits and
counter-suits filled the air,

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Lowe's assistant
administrator resigned,

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
citing an almost unanimous
lack of confidence in his

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.980 align:middle line:90%
objectivity.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> All these people are falling
out of this so-called objective

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:06.240 align:middle line:90%
scientific project.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.220 align:middle line:90%
They're dropping like flies.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And what you have left over
is Ed Condon, and Roy Craig,

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of other
people who've basically

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
been added on at the
last second, trying

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.640 align:middle line:84%
to cobble together a
mishmash of documents

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that they called the
scientific study of UFOs.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a
terrible piece of work.

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The report was immediately
hailed by "The New York Times"

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.970 align:middle line:84%
science reporter, who had
turned out had already written

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
a laudatory introduction
to the paperback edition.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Its 1,485 pages were
prefaced by Condon's 50 pages

01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of negative
conclusions, conclusions

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
that dismissed or ignored
much of the analysis

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.290 align:middle line:90%
in the body of the report.

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Bill Hartman, extremely
skeptical about UFOs,

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
had nevertheless concluded
about the Trent pictures

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that all factors appear to be
consistent with the assertion

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
that an extraordinary
flying object flew

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
within the sight
of two witnesses.

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> He, in his conclusions,
completely ignores--

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.023 align:middle line:90%
>> --ignores talking about that.

01:06:08.023 --> 01:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, infers the
opposite, no question.

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:12.900 align:middle line:90%
I think infers the opposite is--

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Infers the opposite--

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> --fair.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I don't know
quite what to say.

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I think what you're
saying is basically right.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether those
conclusions should have

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
been written
totally differently,

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I suspect they
should have been--

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
you don't write those
things without sort

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
of knowing what the
consequences are going

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.890 align:middle line:90%
to be for people at his level.

01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:38.880 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's just more,
even more deviously canny

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:44.700 align:middle line:90%
than I'm saying.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe he just figures,
well, if I, Edward Condon,

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.960 align:middle line:84%
say there's nothing
here in this report,

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%

qualities in common.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.859 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, many researchers
embraced this idea,

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that a UFOs were the modern
face of an old phenomenon, one

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that was psychosocial in
nature, not extraterrestrial.

that these things couldn't be

01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It was a period of flux,
when the modern history

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
of the phenomenon was about to
make a radical course change.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
A fateful moment
arrived as a tip

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:29.407 align:middle line:84%
from a television
station manager.

01:15:29.407 --> 01:15:30.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Out of the blue,
he says, you know,

01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:33.380 align:middle line:10%
the guy you ought to
talk to is Jesse Marcel.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:36.270 align:middle line:10%
And brilliant investigator
that I am, I said, who's he?

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:38.677 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, he
handled the wreckage of one

01:15:38.677 --> 01:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of those saucers
you're interested in.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:41.760 align:middle line:90%
He was in the military.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.860 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.380 align:middle line:10%
>> The events related
by Major Jesse Marcel,

retired former intelligence
officer of the 509th atomic

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.370 align:middle line:10%
bomb wing at
Roswell, New Mexico,

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:56.970 align:middle line:10%
would provide the seed for a
crashed saucer story that would

01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:00.660 align:middle line:10%
take root and grow like an
enormous weed to overrun

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.210 align:middle line:10%
the UFO landscape.

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Witnesses were discovered who
reported a massive recovery

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:07.530 align:middle line:90%
operation.

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:10.080 align:middle line:10%
More witnesses came
forward, claiming

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.170 align:middle line:10%
they saw wreckage and bodies.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:15.490 align:middle line:10%
>> By 1980, we
talked to 62 people.

01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:19.290 align:middle line:10%
By '85, it was 92 people.

01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:21.990 align:middle line:10%
Around the same time, the
memo that Wilbert Smith

01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:25.290 align:middle line:10%
wrote to his superiors
in Ottawa back in 1950

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:28.350 align:middle line:10%
was discovered in his
papers, the one reporting

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:31.770 align:middle line:10%
on his conversation with Defense
Research Board scientist Dr.

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Robert Sarbacher that a crashed
saucer was being analyzed

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:39.060 align:middle line:10%
by a small group of top
level scientists led

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.810 align:middle line:10%
by Defense Research Board
chief Vannevar Bush.

01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:44.500 align:middle line:10%
Sarbacher was still alive.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:49.260 align:middle line:10%
And when contacted, he confirmed
the contents of the Smith memo.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.220 align:middle line:10%
It seemed that a cover up was
finally beginning to unravel.

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Then, in the mid-'80s--

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Documents began to appear--

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.570 align:middle line:84%
documents of unknown
provenance, for the most part.

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The MJ-12 documents seem
to confirm the Roswell crash

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.420 align:middle line:90%
in the New Mexico desert.

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.910 align:middle line:84%
They purported to be an
eyes-only briefing given

01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:13.320 align:middle line:84%
in 1952 to Dwight Eisenhower
about Operation Majestic

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.150 align:middle line:84%
12, an above top secret project
dealing with crashed saucers

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:20.220 align:middle line:90%
and their occupants.

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Prominently mentioned
was Dr. Vannevar Bush,

01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
thus seeming to confirm
Wilbert Smith's memo.

01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Also present, others
who weighed heavily

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the phenomenon,

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
including the arch
debunker, Dr. Donald Menzel,

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.240 align:middle line:84%
confirming many a
UFO researchers'

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
suspicion that debunkers are
really government agents.

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.630 align:middle line:84%
For most researchers,
though, the documents

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:45.370 align:middle line:90%
looked like a plant.

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Suspicion fell on an agent named
Richard Doty in the Air Force

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Office of Special Investigations
at Kirtland Air Force

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Base near Albuquerque.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The Office of Special
Investigations

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
is the Air Force's
counterintelligence unit.

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And a few years before,
at their Kirtland offices,

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Doty had met with a
producer preparing a program

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.940 align:middle line:90%
on UFOs for the HBO network.

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And with cloak and
dagger theatrics,

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
he had shown her a
very similar document.

01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:17.590 align:middle line:10%
>> There it was,
written in dry English,

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:20.950 align:middle line:10%
about the United States
government's efforts

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:27.040 align:middle line:10%
to retrieve crashed disks
and non-human bodies,

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.910 align:middle line:10%
both dead and alive, from
a variety of locations.

01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And I recall seven,
at least, were listed.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Linda Howe was also promised
long-rumored Air Force footage

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.850 align:middle line:84%
of a UFO landing at White
Sands, New Mexico in 1964.

01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:46.360 align:middle line:84%
After a six-month runaround,
the footage never materialized,

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and HBO canceled
her documentary.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.870 align:middle line:84%
With such a pedigree,
the MJ-12 documents

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
were suspected of being
disinformation, possibly

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
intended to keep the
increasing numbers of Roswell

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
researchers busy
chasing shadows,

01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and well away from whatever
real secrets the Air Force had,

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.370 align:middle line:90%
UFOs or otherwise.

television special claimed

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.870 align:middle line:84%
to shed light on MJ-12
and the UFO cover-up.

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:18.695 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you acquire
the MJ-12 documents?

01:19:18.695 --> 01:19:21.070 align:middle line:10%
>> They were mailed to me in
a plain brown envelope which

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.640 align:middle line:10%
contained a--

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.640 align:middle line:10%
>> The two researchers
who'd been the recipients

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.160 align:middle line:10%
of the MJ-12 documents
introduced us to the Aviary.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> MJ-12 was a group of
people within the government.

01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
MJ-12 was created
by President Truman.

01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>> A silhouetted operative
codenamed Falcon,

01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:41.140 align:middle line:10%
claimed later by the producer
to be Richard Doty himself,

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:44.920 align:middle line:10%
informed us of the structure
of MJ-12 and the startling news

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:48.730 align:middle line:10%
that aliens had been held
since the Truman administration

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:53.350 align:middle line:10%
in a top secret underground
installation called Area 51.

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Their internal
organs are quite simple.

01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Among the details given about
their bodies, civilization,

01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and culture were their
partiality to Tibetan ritual

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:07.010 align:middle line:90%
music and strawberry ice cream.

01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> They have a religion, but
it's a universal religion.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It didn't really require an
alien crystal ball to perceive

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
that with this event, UFO
mythology was veering sharply

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
towards the
conspiratorial fringes.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Less evident was how much
this would be lapped up

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:24.060 align:middle line:90%
by popular culture.

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1953, the
CIA Robertson Panel

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
had recommended debunking
the phenomenon's reality

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and thereby its ability
to affect the population.

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.780 align:middle line:10%
That had obviously failed.

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:44.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the light of
the MJ-12 documents,

01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:46.730 align:middle line:10%
one had to wonder if
the phenomenon was being

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:48.770 align:middle line:10%
deliberately manipulated--

01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:53.270 align:middle line:10%
possibly to hide any real UFO
secrets, but just as possibly

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:57.140 align:middle line:10%
to provide a useful cover
for things more earthly,

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:00.740 align:middle line:10%
like top secret black projects.

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the reasons
behind the MJ-12 documents,

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
they did marginalize
UFO mythology

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to the outer fringes of the
culture, which might have

01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:11.810 align:middle line:90%
been their intent all along.

01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:15.470 align:middle line:90%


01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But by happenstance,
the late '80s

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
saw a new wrinkle
in things that would

01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:22.400 align:middle line:90%
serve much the same purpose.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.030 align:middle line:10%
>> After 1987, the media
became much more interested

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:28.760 align:middle line:10%
in the abduction phenomenon, and
there was sort of an avalanche

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.920 align:middle line:10%
of shows that featured it.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a very good ratings
getter, and so forth.

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> UFO abductions seemed to
strike a deeply resonant chord

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
when they appeared in the mass
media in 1987 with the release

01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:44.630 align:middle line:90%
of two books.

01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Budd Hopkins's
"Intruders" expanded

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
on the similar
memories of people

01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:52.820 align:middle line:84%
who claim missing time
around a UFO encounter.

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The aliens' interest in the
human reproductive system that

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
first appeared with the Betty
and Barney Hill incident

01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:01.850 align:middle line:84%
back in the '60s now
apparently included

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
a production line of hybrid
children, part human, part

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.560 align:middle line:90%
alien.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I was, in a certain
sense, sticking my neck out,

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.020 align:middle line:10%
because other researchers
are going to say, well,

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.320 align:middle line:10%
I've never found anything
like this myself.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.660 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to this.

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Or counter-intuitive
evidence is going

01:22:21.230 --> 01:22:23.130 align:middle line:90%
to come forward, and so forth.

01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet in actual fact,
people began saying, my gosh.

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.620 align:middle line:84%
When I explore
these other avenues,

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding the
same thing he found.

01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> At the same time,
almost in the same week,

01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
the book "Communion" came
out, written by an abductee,

01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
a person who claims to be an
abductee, Whitley Strieber.

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And it hit the top of "The New
York Times" Best Seller list.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It was on "The New York Times"
Best Seller list for 32 weeks.

01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was number one in
the country for 19 weeks.

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
That book had a tremendous
impact societally.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And the impact was
not so much what

01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
he had to say, which
was important enough,

01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:08.300 align:middle line:84%
but was the illustration
on the cover,

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:14.360 align:middle line:84%
the sort of staring alien
that absolutely frightened

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
the devil out of
people who might

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.960 align:middle line:90%
have had these experiences.

the book in a bookstore,

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and they just ran.

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
They ran out of the
mall and kept running.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.590 align:middle line:90%
They were so frightened.

from repressed memories.

01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But the consistent
themes in the abduction

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
narrative also
appeared to express

01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:41.400 align:middle line:90%
the concerns of the times--

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the individual's
loss of control,

01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
genetic manipulation,
and the emerging worries

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.500 align:middle line:90%
about the health of the earth.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Real or not, abductions
were touching

01:23:51.630 --> 01:23:53.160 align:middle line:90%
on something deeply mythic.

Up to this time,
crop circles had just

01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
been indistinct ground markings,
apparently of landed saucers.

Now they began to appear
as elaborate mandalas,

01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:08.980 align:middle line:84%
mostly in England,
where it should

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:13.320 align:middle line:84%
be noted that landscaping
is a form of religion.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Those who believe
some of the circles

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
were more than the work of
nocturnal serial artists

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:22.347 align:middle line:84%
saw them as coded messages
from extraterrestrials.

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:32.720 align:middle line:10%
Also looking for coded messages
from the stars, the search

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:36.560 align:middle line:10%
for extraterrestrial
intelligence, or SETI projects,

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.000 align:middle line:10%
were getting underway.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the major objections
by the scientific community

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of flying saucers
zipping around our planet

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
was the limiting
factor of the speed

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.862 align:middle line:84%
of light, a consequence of
Einstein's special theory

01:24:50.862 --> 01:24:52.022 align:middle line:90%
of relativity.

01:24:52.022 --> 01:24:55.270 align:middle line:90%


01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:57.710 align:middle line:84%
If nothing could travel
faster than light,

01:24:57.710 --> 01:25:01.190 align:middle line:84%
a jaunt to just the nearest star
would take an absolute minimum

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:02.420 align:middle line:90%
of 4 and 1/2 years.

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%


01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, scientists reason,
that if anyone traveled

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.980 align:middle line:84%
the vast distances, even
in our local neighborhood,

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.130 align:middle line:90%
it would be very rarely.

01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't look
like the seeming traffic

01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:19.880 align:middle line:90%
jam being reported.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So SETI projects
started up with the idea

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.050 align:middle line:84%
that smart aliens would
stay home and contact us

01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:32.530 align:middle line:84%
by an interstellar version of an
inexpensive long distance card.

01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all this assumes that
the speed of light cannot be

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
sidestepped in ways unknown
to our present physics.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.240 align:middle line:10%
Given the ever-changing
history of physical laws

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.360 align:middle line:10%
over the last few hundred
years, that assumption

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.080 align:middle line:10%
would appear to be more a
leap of faith than science.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.880 align:middle line:10%
>> It's also part of the
in-training of a scientist

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.140 align:middle line:10%
to set borders on what
that scientist believes is

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.750 align:middle line:10%
the nature of reality.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot more comfortable,
if you have the arrogance

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that you think you're
going to explain everything

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later, to have a
rather narrow set of fences.

01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.920 align:middle line:90%


01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The early '90s saw growing
media fascination with

01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:middle line:90%
the Roswell incident.

New Mexico house
representative Steven Schiff

01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
asked the Air Force about it and
hit a bureaucratic stonewall.

01:26:26.190 --> 01:26:28.020 align:middle line:10%
Annoyed by the lack
of response, he

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:30.060 align:middle line:10%
requested the General
Accounting Office

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.910 align:middle line:10%
to investigate Air Force
communications in and out

01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:36.420 align:middle line:10%
of Roswell in 1947.

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.820 align:middle line:10%
The Air Force
subsequently decided

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:42.310 align:middle line:10%
to conduct their own inquiry.

01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, the
report was prepared

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:48.240 align:middle line:84%
by counter-intelligence
people within the Air Force.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:54.080 align:middle line:10%
It's a case of the fox
guarding the henhouse, I think.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The Air Force report was
prepared by the same Pentagon

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.820 align:middle line:10%
personnel that many researchers
believe had authored the MJ-12

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:02.530 align:middle line:10%
documents.

01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Its 998 pages concluded that
there was indeed a cover up.

01:27:07.090 --> 01:27:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was only of debris from
a secret Project Mogul balloon

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.430 align:middle line:90%
launch that had gone missing.

01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:15.580 align:middle line:10%
Moguls were huge
balloon assemblies

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.430 align:middle line:10%
intended to explore the
possibility of remotely

01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:22.690 align:middle line:10%
monitoring Soviet A-bomb tests.

01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But there were multiple
problems with the explanation.

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:29.110 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there was no
definitive evidence outside

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:31.960 align:middle line:84%
of one scientist's
50-year-old memory

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
that the particular Mogul
launch had ever taken place.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.460 align:middle line:10%
And then, even leaving aside
the multiple witness testimony

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:41.830 align:middle line:10%
about the unearthly
nature of the material

01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:45.850 align:middle line:10%
recovered, the apparent size
and secrecy of the recovery

01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:49.030 align:middle line:10%
operation itself, and
the reported threats

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:51.880 align:middle line:10%
made to witnesses
about keeping silent,

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.910 align:middle line:10%
there remain the simple
fact that Mogul assemblies

01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:58.870 align:middle line:10%
were mostly weather balloons,
tin foil and balsa wood.

01:27:58.870 --> 01:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So how would the chief
intelligence officer as well as

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:05.320 align:middle line:84%
the base commander mistake
such mundane material

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and announce it to the
world as a flying saucer?

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Also somewhat damning was that
the General Accounting Office

01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
found that all communications
in and out of the Roswell

01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:17.680 align:middle line:84%
base for the period
had been destroyed

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.740 align:middle line:90%
without authorization.

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But as there was no smoking, gun
Roswell would remain a mystery.

01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Whatever came down in
the desert back in 1947

01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:32.470 align:middle line:84%
would continue to be
obscured by an expanding

01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:36.730 align:middle line:84%
tangle of testimony,
by suspect documents,

01:28:36.730 --> 01:28:40.441 align:middle line:84%
and by what would become
the UFO hoax of all time.

01:28:40.441 --> 01:28:43.740 align:middle line:90%

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:46.770 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, Fox broadcast
what purported

01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:50.910 align:middle line:84%
to be film of a
Roswell alien autopsy.

01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Is it faked?

01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:53.780 align:middle line:90%
the program asked.

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But the question was
really rhetorical,

01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
as the only required answer
was enormous ratings.

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
As tabloid TV was feasting
like zombies on UFOs,

01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream media
apparently decided

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to rise above the
silliness, and they

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.380 align:middle line:84%
stopped reporting UFO
sightings altogether,

quite spectacular.

problems.

In the first place,
as folklore shows us,

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.880 align:middle line:84%
people will take a story,
but they will always vary it.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll always add to it,
change it, personalize it--

01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:33.210 align:middle line:84%
in some way, make a new creation
out of the old materials.

01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:35.860 align:middle line:84%

of personalization.

phenomenology of the story,

01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:44.850 align:middle line:84%
