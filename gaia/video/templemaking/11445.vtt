00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.619
(soft wind)

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.111
(tranquil strum)

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.721
<v Voiceover>In many ways,</v>

4
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.991
life has changed little over thousands of years.

5
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:45.361
We still conduct our daily rituals

6
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.841
and walk among buildings

7
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:49.101
who's faces reflect the past.

8
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.681
We still wake up, we eat, drink

9
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.561
we go to work,

10
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:10.271
and we still ask ourselves that timeless question,

11
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.491
why am I here?

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.840
But what we tend to hear back

13
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.500
is that we have lost our connection

14
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.290
to the nature of things.

15
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.460
Just like the mystery of life,

16
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.159
the journey you're about to take

17
00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.990
is also timeless.

18
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.899
An initiation into ancient systems of knowledge

19
00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.440
once used by high priests, shaman, and Pharohs

20
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.930
in their sanctuaries.

21
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.040
And that knowledge can be applied

22
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.950
in our sanctuaries today.

23
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.430
Temples come in all shapes and forms,

24
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.670
tall, small, hidden,

25
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.727
unobtrusive,

26
00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:14.427
subtle, and overt.

27
00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:18.087
But they all share one common characteristic.

28
00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:22.937
Everyone is a sacred space of subtle, living energy

29
00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:25.437
created using identical principles

30
00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.547
that have no expire date.

31
00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:32.897
In this program,

32
00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:34.317
we will discover the principles

33
00:02:34.317 --> 00:02:36.277
that harness subtle energies

34
00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:38.157
and create portals of possibility

35
00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.247
in our own daily lives.

36
00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.697
And in doing so,

37
00:02:46.697 --> 00:02:48.257
we shall increase the potential

38
00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:50.707
to live our lives as co-creators.

39
00:02:52.757 --> 00:02:55.987
(rock beat)

40
00:03:53.217 --> 00:03:56.227
(birds chirping)

41
00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:04.057
There's one important characteristic

42
00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:07.647
that differentiates us from our predecessors,

43
00:04:09.337 --> 00:04:12.457
those who came before possessed a greater understanding

44
00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:14.887
of the forces that shape our world.

45
00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:27.437
They discovered that everything that works in life

46
00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:29.957
is based on a sympathetic relationship

47
00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:32.067
with universal laws.

48
00:04:38.097 --> 00:04:40.977
In addition to measuring the cycle of seasons,

49
00:04:40.977 --> 00:04:42.837
and the movement of stars,

50
00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:44.937
their prime motivation was the creation

51
00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:47.947
of a closer bond with the unseen universe.

52
00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:52.477
They reasoned by that transposing

53
00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:55.157
specific cosmic principles on earth,

54
00:04:55.157 --> 00:04:57.237
they could ride away with energy

55
00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.547
that connected them to the heart of everything.

56
00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:04.327
The Egyptians called it, as above so below.

57
00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:09.637
This spiritual technology opened doorways

58
00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:12.036
to other levels of reality.

59
00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:14.076
Offering them greater understanding

60
00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:17.586
of the environment as well as control over their lives.

61
00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:23.076
And so they embarked on a colossal building program

62
00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:25.436
setting up antennas around the world

63
00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:28.026
to communicate with the invisible universe.

64
00:05:31.656 --> 00:05:33.556
Wherever these were placed,

65
00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:36.226
balance was restored to the land.

66
00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:40.316
And people who interacted with these sanctuaries

67
00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:44.594
became atoned, that is at one

68
00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:48.284
with the visible end of the invisible.

69
00:05:49.674 --> 00:05:52.254
Consequently ancient cultures functioned

70
00:05:52.254 --> 00:05:55.534
with greater stability because they were working with

71
00:05:55.534 --> 00:05:59.524
rather than against the subtle machinery of nature.

72
00:06:02.374 --> 00:06:05.474
With these temples, they created portals of power

73
00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:07.524
across the face of the earth.

74
00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.624
And their perseverance is our legacy.

75
00:06:14.334 --> 00:06:18.324
(synthesizer with piano chords)

76
00:06:22.234 --> 00:06:24.374
Rediscovering and applying their principles

77
00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:27.704
in our modern life has become more urgent than ever.

78
00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:31.934
Increasingly divorced from the natural world,

79
00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:34.494
we struggle to find answers to why our lives

80
00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:36.584
seem so rudderless.

81
00:06:43.114 --> 00:06:45.954
Indeed our generation is shrouded in a kind of

82
00:06:45.954 --> 00:06:48.144
spiritual deficit sorta.

83
00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:51.534
A lack of connection with natural forces

84
00:06:51.534 --> 00:06:55.094
the very forces that exist for our guidance.

85
00:06:55.094 --> 00:06:57.384
And ultimately for our survival.

86
00:07:02.374 --> 00:07:05.394
We must rediscover the lost art of temple making

87
00:07:05.394 --> 00:07:08.474
to create sanctuaries where we and the universe

88
00:07:08.474 --> 00:07:10.844
can engage in intimate dialog.

89
00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:14.854
Our very own places of elimination,

90
00:07:14.854 --> 00:07:17.584
communication, and transformation.

91
00:07:24.934 --> 00:07:27.794
But what exactly makes sacred space different

92
00:07:27.794 --> 00:07:29.384
from profane space?

93
00:07:30.514 --> 00:07:32.054
(rock beat)

94
00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:34.354
Our ancestors understood that life is based

95
00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:37.384
on the principle of harmonic resonance.

96
00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:40.054
It is a view now shared by the

97
00:07:40.054 --> 00:07:42.604
enlightened scientific community.

98
00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:45.534
This cosmic rhythm and balance

99
00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:47.524
binds all atoms and molecules.

100
00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.324
It underlies all that exists.

101
00:08:03.554 --> 00:08:05.474
Such a concept is enshrined in the

102
00:08:05.474 --> 00:08:07.454
esoteric branch of Islam

103
00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.734
which seized the primary creative source,

104
00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:12.614
not as a human form or icon, but as

105
00:08:12.614 --> 00:08:15.994
orderly geometric relationships.

106
00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:18.674
In fact, they describe these geometric patterns

107
00:08:18.674 --> 00:08:21.324
as the image of god at rest.

108
00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:25.674
Our predecessors also understood

109
00:08:25.674 --> 00:08:28.804
that all living organisms generate a resonance.

110
00:08:30.454 --> 00:08:32.354
And the vitality of every organism

111
00:08:32.354 --> 00:08:34.234
depends on the level of connection between

112
00:08:34.234 --> 00:08:37.604
it's resonance and that of its local environment.

113
00:08:39.494 --> 00:08:43.174
Thus if a sympathetic resonance exists between the two,

114
00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:45.293
then a bond is established.

115
00:08:45.293 --> 00:08:47.343
And information is exchanged.

116
00:08:49.273 --> 00:08:51.213
In the field of human affairs,

117
00:08:51.213 --> 00:08:53.683
we refer to this as falling in love.

118
00:09:01.593 --> 00:09:03.933
But since we tend to live in a state of duality

119
00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:05.133
here on earth,

120
00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:09.193
we invent a separation between physical and the non-physical

121
00:09:09.193 --> 00:09:13.033
the human ego plus an over association

122
00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:16.852
with the material world inevitably leads to a disconnection

123
00:09:16.852 --> 00:09:18.932
with the forces we do not see,

124
00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:22.342
which paradoxically are integral to our lives.

125
00:09:30.532 --> 00:09:34.222
And so we become diseased with our environment.

126
00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:39.532
Scientifically speaking, the resonance between our molecules

127
00:09:39.532 --> 00:09:42.842
and our environment becomes unbalanced.

128
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:46.401
Our inner geometry enters a state of chaos.

129
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:51.551
It can be said that we go from being well

130
00:09:51.551 --> 00:09:53.601
to being in hell.

131
00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:57.181
And it's a fine line between the two.

132
00:09:58.391 --> 00:10:00.271
In such an imbalanced enviroment

133
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:02.431
we short circuit our natural ability

134
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:05.941
to connect and work with the subtle forces around us.

135
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:09.751
Through the ages, these forces have been

136
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:13.721
described as angels, fairies, spirits.

137
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:17.401
Even god.

138
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:20.691
But regardless of how we describe it,

139
00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:22.631
in such a state of separation,

140
00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:24.831
we lessened our ability to manifest

141
00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:27.511
what we require and achieve our purpose

142
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:28.761
in this life.

143
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:35.771
Such concepts form the basis of esoteric studies

144
00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:37.501
taught in ancient history schools.

145
00:10:38.091 --> 00:10:39.901
Particularly those of Egypt.

146
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:47.371
Their principles were deemed so important

147
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:49.531
to the purposeful conduct of life,

148
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:51.031
that they were zealously guarded

149
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:55.251
by later esoteric traditions such as the Cathar Muslims,

150
00:10:55.251 --> 00:10:58.951
the knights Templars, the Bogomils, and early Freemason

151
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:02.321
who defended them at the enormous personal cost.

152
00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:11.511
The goal of these esoteric orders was one and the same.

153
00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:14.211
Reestablish a sympathetic resonance with the

154
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:17.591
cosmic forces that harness all aspects of energy

155
00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:19.521
and conscious manifestation.

156
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:23.561
In other words, be a co-creator.

157
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:29.911
This goal was accomplished by applying specific principles

158
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:32.551
that generated the resonant environment

159
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:34.781
with which one was able to interact.

160
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:38.711
One technique was to apply natural harmonics

161
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:40.431
in the arrangement of elements

162
00:11:40.431 --> 00:11:42.201
within the temple.

163
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:51.521
Another was to use the energy of water.

164
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:02.361
Even lines of magnetic force were moved to the sight.

165
00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:10.411
Stones and crystals were specifically choosen

166
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.550
to anchor these streams of energy.

167
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.520
And to amplify the intent of each temple.

168
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.030
Certain parts of the temple were

169
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.610
designed to awaken principle energy radiums

170
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.440
of the human body.

171
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.330
This enabled a person's energy field

172
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.380
to be opened slowly.

173
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.090
Allowing finer, more penetrating frequencies

174
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.060
to influence the body.

175
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.970
As you can see to regard these oracles

176
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.050
as mere places of worship is to do an injustice

177
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.180
to the genius to the temple builders.

178
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.770
Clearly these monuments were meant for something

179
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.109
other than worship.

180
00:12:55.109 --> 00:12:58.829
in fact their ancient semetic name is Beth Arod,

181
00:12:58.829 --> 00:13:01.879
meaning a house of work.

182
00:13:02.869 --> 00:13:05.749
Therefore these temples were not used for worship,

183
00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:08.729
but workship, they were workshops

184
00:13:08.729 --> 00:13:11.599
places of initiation into the sacred arts.

185
00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:21.809
In parts of the Iberian peninsula,

186
00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:23.549
they are called Betillo meaning

187
00:13:23.549 --> 00:13:25.479
a house of god.

188
00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.629
yet it stretches the imagination

189
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:31.679
to see these as houses.

190
00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:35.489
From the spirit of the purpose

191
00:13:35.489 --> 00:13:36.929
for which they were built.

192
00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:39.149
The name implies a place of connecting

193
00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:41.179
with the source of creation.

194
00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:46.739
Some of these houses are over 8,000 years old.

195
00:13:51.849 --> 00:13:53.829
The wisdom keepers at these temples

196
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:55.619
were masters of the craft.

197
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:59.229
By 1300 BC, their main center

198
00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:01.859
was in the Egyptian city of Honna.

199
00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:04.989
Today reduced to a solid three obelisk,

200
00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:06.939
amid noisy Cairo.

201
00:14:09.489 --> 00:14:12.379
The roots of the craft of the free masons are found here.

202
00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:16.899
Such wisdom keepers were described as cunning.

203
00:14:16.928 --> 00:14:20.278
A word stemming from the old English kynning,

204
00:14:21.168 --> 00:14:23.998
meaning knowing special, esoteric knowledge.

205
00:14:25.528 --> 00:14:28.508
So next time someone calls you a cunning person,

206
00:14:28.508 --> 00:14:30.658
be sure to thank them.

207
00:14:34.468 --> 00:14:37.978
Their interdimensional doorways were built to last.

208
00:14:38.968 --> 00:14:40.928
An insurance policy for a time when we

209
00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:43.608
as a society, would lose our connection

210
00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:45.988
to the unseen and overassociate

211
00:14:45.988 --> 00:14:48.158
with the material world.

212
00:14:49.048 --> 00:14:51.118
And that time is now.

213
00:14:53.128 --> 00:14:55.348
Some portals have been in continuous use

214
00:14:55.348 --> 00:14:57.058
for thousands of years.

215
00:14:59.408 --> 00:15:02.308
Like Glastonbury, it remained places of pilgrimmage

216
00:15:02.308 --> 00:15:05.128
as though people still understand and resonate

217
00:15:05.128 --> 00:15:06.918
with their underlying purpose.

218
00:15:07.568 --> 00:15:09.838
Consciously or otherwise.

219
00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:16.928
Because sacred sites were strategically positioned

220
00:15:16.928 --> 00:15:18.868
to take advantage of the subtle forces

221
00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:20.818
inherent in the land,

222
00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:24.188
many would later become seats of centralized power.

223
00:15:24.188 --> 00:15:26.528
As a predominant experience of humanity

224
00:15:26.528 --> 00:15:30.818
swung from cooperation and unity to control and fear.

225
00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:36.758
The tower of London is one such example.

226
00:15:38.148 --> 00:15:40.208
Strategically placed on an ancient mound

227
00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:42.108
by William the Conqueror,

228
00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.168
one of the last kings to understand

229
00:15:44.168 --> 00:15:46.978
the principles of manipulating portals of energy.

230
00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:51.308
By imposing his intent on this portal,

231
00:15:51.308 --> 00:15:54.278
he was able to subjugate an entire nation.

232
00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:07.008
Originally named for the Egyptian goddess Isis,

233
00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:09.808
Paris is an excellent example of temple making

234
00:16:09.808 --> 00:16:11.518
on a grand scale.

235
00:16:18.468 --> 00:16:20.688
The city is fashioned on the ground plan

236
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:23.878
of the temples of Luxor and Carmac.

237
00:16:24.848 --> 00:16:26.548
And upon visiting, there's no doubt

238
00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:29.188
there's an air of connectivity with higher principles

239
00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.578
permeates this city of romance.

240
00:16:38.568 --> 00:16:41.728
Like Paris, Washington DC was originally planned

241
00:16:41.728 --> 00:16:44.628
by Freemasonic orders who applied the principles

242
00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:46.298
of sacred geometry.

243
00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:49.828
The intent was to create a universal city

244
00:16:49.828 --> 00:16:53.138
that nurtured the noblest principles of humanity.

245
00:16:54.688 --> 00:16:58.518
So obviously this technology can be used and abused.

246
00:16:59.348 --> 00:17:01.478
After all, energy is simply energy.

247
00:17:01.928 --> 00:17:04.068
And human intent being one of the most powerful

248
00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:06.728
creative energies can choose to use it for

249
00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:08.938
wrong action...

250
00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:13.158
or for right action.

251
00:17:22.868 --> 00:17:25.328
To remind us just how far we have misplaced

252
00:17:25.328 --> 00:17:27.548
our connection to the Sacred,

253
00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:30.648
11,000 crop circles have mysteriously appeared

254
00:17:30.648 --> 00:17:34.538
beside ancient sacred sites in 29 countries.

255
00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:39.568
This phenomenon has been appearing

256
00:17:39.568 --> 00:17:41.478
for over 100 years.

257
00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.348
In South Africa, they are referred to

258
00:17:45.348 --> 00:17:47.558
as the great circles of the gods.

259
00:17:49.188 --> 00:17:51.368
Perhaps the spirits of our ancestors

260
00:17:51.368 --> 00:17:54.368
are sending a message because the same principles

261
00:17:54.368 --> 00:17:56.988
once employed to create their temples,

262
00:17:56.988 --> 00:18:00.818
are now found and coded in these enigmatic symbols.

263
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.988
Because the principles of sacred space

264
00:18:15.988 --> 00:18:18.988
work as well as they did 8,000 years ago,

265
00:18:18.988 --> 00:18:20.868
they can easily be applied to today in our

266
00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:24.368
modern environments to enhance our well-being

267
00:18:24.368 --> 00:18:26.398
and that of the earth.

268
00:18:28.468 --> 00:18:31.488
By applying the seven principles of sacred space,

269
00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:33.768
you will be able to create an environment of subtle

270
00:18:33.768 --> 00:18:37.008
energies that enable you to connect and communicate

271
00:18:37.008 --> 00:18:39.947
more effectively with invisible forces.

272
00:18:39.947 --> 00:18:43.607
Such as sacred space can be used for receiving information

273
00:18:43.607 --> 00:18:45.567
or guidance.

274
00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:50.067
To create a temple that amplifies your energy

275
00:18:50.067 --> 00:18:53.006
and multiplies the potential of your own power.

276
00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:56.676
Thereby aiding your own conscious manifestation process.

277
00:18:59.066 --> 00:19:01.666
To establish an environment that heals and rejuvenates

278
00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:03.896
the body and the mind.

279
00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:10.706
For the more ambitious,

280
00:19:10.706 --> 00:19:12.226
the principles of sacred space

281
00:19:12.226 --> 00:19:14.416
can be applied on a grand scale.

282
00:19:15.486 --> 00:19:17.106
Groups of like minded people

283
00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:18.986
can create temples to facilitate

284
00:19:18.986 --> 00:19:22.945
the forces of light, across a large tract of land.

285
00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:25.055
Even an entire city.

286
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:34.065
Or simply to create a sanctuary in a room

287
00:19:34.065 --> 00:19:36.225
a work space or a garden

288
00:19:36.225 --> 00:19:38.455
where one can be at ease with the world.

289
00:19:41.505 --> 00:19:43.485
Many formal European gardens

290
00:19:43.485 --> 00:19:45.985
were designed with principles taught at this program.

291
00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.725
So it is not surprising how they still attract

292
00:19:48.725 --> 00:19:50.755
millions of visitors.

293
00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:01.735
Temples can be very simple.

294
00:20:04.445 --> 00:20:06.855
They can be part of the landscape.

295
00:20:15.765 --> 00:20:18.675
They can be functional yet unobtrusive.

296
00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.885
Some of the principles at work at Stone hedge

297
00:20:21.885 --> 00:20:25.055
are discretely employed within this small urban apartment.

298
00:20:26.404 --> 00:20:27.765
Later in this program,

299
00:20:27.765 --> 00:20:29.715
we shall discover how.

300
00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:34.625
All temples are built on a foundation

301
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:36.265
of principles that are analogous

302
00:20:36.265 --> 00:20:38.484
to their host environment.

303
00:20:38.484 --> 00:20:40.734
In this case, the planet earth.

304
00:20:41.864 --> 00:20:43.524
And the more processes are applied,

305
00:20:43.524 --> 00:20:45.124
the greater the connection between you

306
00:20:45.124 --> 00:20:48.734
your environment, and all levels of reality.

307
00:20:50.704 --> 00:20:53.104
So let us now look at each of the seven principles

308
00:20:53.104 --> 00:20:54.874
of sacred space.

309
00:20:58.644 --> 00:21:02.374
(rock music)

310
00:21:03.864 --> 00:21:06.264
Now let's begin to construct our very own portal

311
00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:09.164
of possibility by selecting a desired location

312
00:21:09.164 --> 00:21:12.194
and examining the first principle.

313
00:21:31.264 --> 00:21:34.934
Water covers two thirds of the body of the planet.

314
00:21:37.744 --> 00:21:40.444
Coincidentally, this mysterious element

315
00:21:40.444 --> 00:21:43.574
makes up two thirds of the human body.

316
00:21:48.364 --> 00:21:51.464
This makes water a fundamental ingredient in temples

317
00:21:51.464 --> 00:21:54.464
because it mirrors those who benefit the most

318
00:21:54.464 --> 00:21:56.194
from their use.

319
00:22:00.144 --> 00:22:03.784
That water interacts with the forces shaping the universe

320
00:22:03.784 --> 00:22:06.024
is demonstrated by the way an object

321
00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:08.204
traveling through it creates a wake of

322
00:22:08.204 --> 00:22:11.814
approximately 94.7 degrees.

323
00:22:15.784 --> 00:22:17.564
This is the same angle at which

324
00:22:17.564 --> 00:22:20.544
energy rises from the core of a planet

325
00:22:20.544 --> 00:22:24.194
and manifests on the surface as the most active spot.

326
00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:29.664
On earth, this is evidenced by the Hawaiian volcanoes

327
00:22:29.664 --> 00:22:33.894
which sit at 19.47 degrees of latitude.

328
00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:38.484
The same concept is found on other planets

329
00:22:38.484 --> 00:22:40.694
throughout the solar system.

330
00:22:54.204 --> 00:22:56.244
When water interacts with humans,

331
00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:58.294
interesting things occur.

332
00:22:59.304 --> 00:23:01.744
Being two thirds water, the human body

333
00:23:01.744 --> 00:23:06.144
and its electromagnetic field plus the resonance

334
00:23:06.144 --> 00:23:09.494
of its intent, make for a powerful combination.

335
00:23:13.904 --> 00:23:16.044
As observed during rain ceremonies

336
00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:18.424
conducted by shaman in New Mexico

337
00:23:18.424 --> 00:23:20.104
and the Middle East,

338
00:23:20.104 --> 00:23:22.394
water reacts to such a formula.

339
00:23:24.664 --> 00:23:26.324
In laboratory experiments,

340
00:23:26.324 --> 00:23:28.164
this interaction is both measurable

341
00:23:28.164 --> 00:23:30.034
and dramatic.

342
00:23:30.864 --> 00:23:33.164
Here the crystallized structure of Tap water

343
00:23:33.164 --> 00:23:36.904
shows a significant difference before and after contact

344
00:23:36.904 --> 00:23:40.414
with the photo of an affectionate child.

345
00:23:42.944 --> 00:23:44.403
In another experiment,

346
00:23:44.403 --> 00:23:46.183
using identical waters,

347
00:23:46.183 --> 00:23:49.683
the phrases I love you and I will kill you

348
00:23:49.683 --> 00:23:51.903
were written on separate bottles

349
00:23:51.903 --> 00:23:54.293
which focused intent.

350
00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:57.483
The comparative results

351
00:23:57.483 --> 00:24:00.663
revealed the effect of such contrasting energies

352
00:24:00.663 --> 00:24:03.103
and demonstrates the power and influence

353
00:24:03.103 --> 00:24:05.953
of human intent on matter.

354
00:24:11.143 --> 00:24:13.643
Hardly surprising therefore that old temples

355
00:24:13.643 --> 00:24:16.893
are sited above or beside water.

356
00:24:22.063 --> 00:24:25.043
Even in places where it is not immediately obvious

357
00:24:25.043 --> 00:24:27.883
such as in the deserts of Egypt and Arizona

358
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.963
where vents of water are at work beneath the temples

359
00:24:30.963 --> 00:24:34.193
generating a subtle electromagnetic field.

360
00:24:38.763 --> 00:24:41.583
The tradition of honoring water at sacred sites

361
00:24:41.583 --> 00:24:44.743
continues today through the use of holy wells

362
00:24:44.743 --> 00:24:48.033
and fonts of water in all the churches.

363
00:24:51.363 --> 00:24:54.703
Such water possesses greater properties of spin

364
00:24:54.703 --> 00:24:56.983
and absorbs light to a greater degree

365
00:24:56.983 --> 00:24:58.953
than ordinary water.

366
00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:02.623
Such potentized liquid makes an excellent conductor

367
00:25:02.623 --> 00:25:04.433
of energy.

368
00:25:07.823 --> 00:25:10.263
So the first element in temple making

369
00:25:10.263 --> 00:25:12.783
is the vetter vains of underground water

370
00:25:12.783 --> 00:25:15.753
to the location where you wish to build your temple.

371
00:25:17.263 --> 00:25:20.223
This procedure applies regardless if your temple

372
00:25:20.223 --> 00:25:22.463
is on the ground.

373
00:25:24.413 --> 00:25:26.893
Or 50 stories above it.

374
00:25:39.903 --> 00:25:42.893
To achieve this we use the law of attraction.

375
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:49.103
We focus our attention and then apply

376
00:25:49.103 --> 00:25:50.993
our intention.

377
00:25:57.283 --> 00:25:59.903
Focusing your attention allows your atoms

378
00:25:59.903 --> 00:26:01.983
to consciously connect with the atoms

379
00:26:01.983 --> 00:26:03.993
of the object in mind.

380
00:26:04.503 --> 00:26:06.453
In this case, water.

381
00:26:06.963 --> 00:26:08.423
And the recognition takes place

382
00:26:08.423 --> 00:26:09.893
between the two.

383
00:26:12.323 --> 00:26:15.723
Your intention gives energy to this connection.

384
00:26:15.723 --> 00:26:18.493
So that action can take place.

385
00:26:24.523 --> 00:26:27.223
Send your attention out to all streams

386
00:26:27.223 --> 00:26:30.053
of natural water below the soil around you.

387
00:26:31.883 --> 00:26:35.423
Now use your intention to draw that water

388
00:26:35.423 --> 00:26:37.873
to the location of your temple.

389
00:26:39.543 --> 00:26:41.923
Reinforce it by visualizing the water

390
00:26:41.923 --> 00:26:44.283
trickling like ribbons through the soil

391
00:26:44.283 --> 00:26:46.353
and towards the temple.

392
00:26:47.703 --> 00:26:49.423
And as you hold this image,

393
00:26:49.423 --> 00:26:53.683
say out loud, by my conscious intent

394
00:26:53.683 --> 00:26:56.563
I ask that natural streams of water

395
00:26:56.563 --> 00:26:58.893
be drawn to this location.

396
00:26:59.803 --> 00:27:02.523
For the purpose of creating a temple of light

397
00:27:02.523 --> 00:27:06.043
for the highest good of the local spirit,

398
00:27:06.043 --> 00:27:09.073
and for the highest good of all.

399
00:27:15.063 --> 00:27:16.883
You can choose your own words

400
00:27:16.883 --> 00:27:20.053
but be very very specific in your request.

401
00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:24.243
It is done.

402
00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:27.403
The conviction of your intent together with the belief

403
00:27:27.403 --> 00:27:30.003
and acceptance that you have stirred a conscious

404
00:27:30.003 --> 00:27:33.163
act into motion are key to the success of this

405
00:27:33.163 --> 00:27:35.713
or any operation.

406
00:27:39.443 --> 00:27:42.653
Water will start a trickle to the location instantly.

407
00:27:43.243 --> 00:27:46.183
And since water has to travel around physical objects,

408
00:27:46.183 --> 00:27:50.383
such as rocks and soil, the process will continue to build

409
00:27:50.383 --> 00:27:53.513
and settle over the course of several days.

410
00:27:57.793 --> 00:27:59.497
Trust the process.

411
00:27:59.497 --> 00:28:01.857
Belief and acceptance in your ability

412
00:28:01.857 --> 00:28:05.747
as a co-creator are key to the success of this endeavor.

413
00:28:11.797 --> 00:28:13.897
The second principle of temple making

414
00:28:13.897 --> 00:28:15.727
is magnetism.

415
00:28:49.037 --> 00:28:51.437
To ancient eyes and indeed to anyone

416
00:28:51.437 --> 00:28:53.707
with a developed sense of intuition,

417
00:28:53.977 --> 00:28:57.047
the landscape we inhabit looks a little different.

418
00:29:04.457 --> 00:29:07.927
It is full of eddies and spirals of energy.

419
00:29:11.997 --> 00:29:15.317
In southern Britain, the canical mound of Silbury Hill

420
00:29:15.317 --> 00:29:18.257
marks and accentuates once such spiraling

421
00:29:18.257 --> 00:29:20.167
motion of energy.

422
00:29:21.517 --> 00:29:24.747
It seems at form follows function.

423
00:29:25.377 --> 00:29:26.957
But there is another form that moves

424
00:29:26.957 --> 00:29:28.567
through the land.

425
00:29:30.797 --> 00:29:32.717
Pathways of magnetic energy

426
00:29:32.717 --> 00:29:36.777
the ancients called them spirit roads

427
00:29:36.777 --> 00:29:40.147
serpent lines, and dragons.

428
00:29:43.457 --> 00:29:45.917
Throughout Celtic lands they are still called

429
00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:48.577
fairy paths and heaven help you,

430
00:29:48.577 --> 00:29:51.137
if you block their flow with a gate or a wall

431
00:29:51.137 --> 00:29:53.277
because doing so interrupts the flow

432
00:29:53.277 --> 00:29:56.527
of living energy to the land and all who live there.

433
00:29:59.937 --> 00:30:02.837
They curve through valleys, mountain tops,

434
00:30:02.837 --> 00:30:06.747
woods, and streams, houses, and villages.

435
00:30:14.514 --> 00:30:16.234
Like an electric circuit,

436
00:30:16.234 --> 00:30:20.004
the magnetic lines are positively or negatively charged.

437
00:30:20.454 --> 00:30:22.114
Or to put it another way,

438
00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:25.123
they are masculine or feminine in polarity.

439
00:30:28.954 --> 00:30:30.594
Since they are magnetic,

440
00:30:30.594 --> 00:30:32.194
they enable the sending and receiving

441
00:30:32.194 --> 00:30:34.014
of bits of information between points

442
00:30:34.014 --> 00:30:36.404
including planets.

443
00:30:36.894 --> 00:30:38.744
Perhaps even further.

444
00:30:39.752 --> 00:30:43.103
In a way, they behave like interstellar conveyor belts

445
00:30:44.413 --> 00:30:46.733
Balls of light or structured craft are often seen

446
00:30:46.733 --> 00:30:50.742
along these pathways and so they are used for traveling,

447
00:30:51.533 --> 00:30:53.803
in a wider sense of the word.

448
00:30:56.893 --> 00:30:59.893
Not surprisingly, all temples without exception,

449
00:30:59.893 --> 00:31:01.713
are situated at the cross roads

450
00:31:01.713 --> 00:31:04.583
of these invisible paths of magnetic energy.

451
00:31:31.472 --> 00:31:34.192
Across southern Britain, there exists an alignment

452
00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:36.633
of ancient temples, standing stones,

453
00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:40.073
Celtic Christian churches, Gothic Cathedrals,

454
00:31:40.073 --> 00:31:42.993
and other sacred sites, and all of them are found

455
00:31:42.993 --> 00:31:45.883
along two major trimitires of this energy.

456
00:31:49.232 --> 00:31:52.093
Some even mark the exact position of the serpent

457
00:31:52.093 --> 00:31:53.823
and its energy node.

458
00:32:02.293 --> 00:32:04.253
What is curious is that all of them

459
00:32:04.253 --> 00:32:06.433
are dedicated to a deity that reflects

460
00:32:06.433 --> 00:32:08.593
the gember of the magnetic path

461
00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.363
upon which they stand.

462
00:32:12.913 --> 00:32:14.373
In the case of churches,

463
00:32:14.373 --> 00:32:15.993
those built on the male path

464
00:32:15.993 --> 00:32:18.193
are dedicated to the Archangel Michael

465
00:32:18.193 --> 00:32:21.103
or his modern counterpart, St. George.

466
00:32:27.293 --> 00:32:28.993
Those on the female path

467
00:32:28.993 --> 00:32:32.023
are dedicated to Mary or her mother, Ann.

468
00:32:33.673 --> 00:32:36.132
Thus these two magnetic lines become known

469
00:32:36.132 --> 00:32:38.483
as the Michael and Mary lines.

470
00:32:40.652 --> 00:32:42.912
Many of the newer temples also stand

471
00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:45.882
on top of old neolithic or druid sites.

472
00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:52.503
An identical situation exists across much of Europe.

473
00:32:53.873 --> 00:32:55.493
The head of the dragon begins its journey

474
00:32:55.493 --> 00:32:57.803
along a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean.

475
00:32:58.632 --> 00:33:01.153
Appropriately named Skellig Michael.

476
00:33:01.153 --> 00:33:04.223
Atop of which, there are Celtic and neolithic chapels.

477
00:33:14.073 --> 00:33:17.592
Its tale concludes at the plate of Megido in Israel.

478
00:33:17.592 --> 00:33:20.522
Better known today as Armageddon.

479
00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:25.133
Clearly there is an implied warning

480
00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:27.083
in this coincidence.

481
00:33:27.933 --> 00:33:29.713
And correct use of these pathways of energy

482
00:33:29.713 --> 00:33:32.843
could have disastrous consequences for the world.

483
00:33:42.093 --> 00:33:46.223
Why is this magnetic energy so important in tintle making?

484
00:33:46.893 --> 00:33:48.912
The answer lies in the effects of magnetism

485
00:33:48.912 --> 00:33:50.983
on the human body.

486
00:33:55.073 --> 00:33:57.713
There exists substantial deposits of magnetite

487
00:33:57.713 --> 00:33:59.662
in the human brain.

488
00:34:00.473 --> 00:34:02.473
Small changes in the local magnetic field

489
00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:04.703
can alter its state of perception.

490
00:34:06.053 --> 00:34:09.053
Magnetism can also vibrate the pineal gland

491
00:34:09.053 --> 00:34:11.393
causing a chemical reaction in the brain

492
00:34:11.393 --> 00:34:14.103
which leads to altered states of awareness.

493
00:34:15.513 --> 00:34:17.773
In this state, a person is more capable

494
00:34:17.773 --> 00:34:19.773
of perceiving information from more

495
00:34:19.773 --> 00:34:21.783
subtle levels of reality.

496
00:34:24.293 --> 00:34:27.013
This concept is symbolized by the raised cobra

497
00:34:27.013 --> 00:34:29.303
placed on a pharaoh's brow.

498
00:34:29.953 --> 00:34:32.463
The location of the third eye shakra.

499
00:34:33.393 --> 00:34:36.633
The raised cobra not only mimics the raised pineal,

500
00:34:36.633 --> 00:34:39.993
but since it no longer slides along the ground,

501
00:34:39.993 --> 00:34:42.653
it shows that the Pharaoh no longer identifies

502
00:34:42.653 --> 00:34:46.223
his existence purely with material forces.

503
00:34:47.513 --> 00:34:49.173
Like the vulture beside it,

504
00:34:49.173 --> 00:34:52.013
he now flies above his incarnate body,

505
00:34:52.013 --> 00:34:55.103
raised toward the sky and spiritualized.

506
00:34:59.473 --> 00:35:02.353
Magnetism also stimulates the human body

507
00:35:02.353 --> 00:35:06.463
by influencing the particles of iron contained in blood.

508
00:35:16.393 --> 00:35:20.132
Like water, incorporating the snaking magnetic paths

509
00:35:20.132 --> 00:35:23.563
in the temple is both practical and empowering.

510
00:35:27.073 --> 00:35:28.893
Eating the fruits of this wisdom

511
00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:31.113
allows you to work with natural energy

512
00:35:31.113 --> 00:35:33.103
and connect with spirit.

513
00:35:34.013 --> 00:35:35.492
And since this process does not

514
00:35:35.492 --> 00:35:37.633
require a middleman, it once drove

515
00:35:37.633 --> 00:35:39.913
the Roman Catholic church to concoct

516
00:35:39.913 --> 00:35:43.283
the association between the serpent and evil.

517
00:35:46.092 --> 00:35:50.423
In Sacred sights, magnetism and water are intertwined.

518
00:35:51.173 --> 00:35:53.803
Because magnetism is attracted to water.

519
00:35:58.053 --> 00:35:59.913
Since we have already moved water

520
00:35:59.913 --> 00:36:02.043
to the site of our proposed temple,

521
00:36:03.053 --> 00:36:05.013
the process of attracting a magnetic line

522
00:36:05.013 --> 00:36:06.823
is made that much simpler.

523
00:36:08.953 --> 00:36:11.503
Let us apply the law of attraction.

524
00:36:20.133 --> 00:36:24.132
Sent out your attention to all magnetic lines.

525
00:36:24.132 --> 00:36:27.781
Imagine these as ribbons flowing along the land.

526
00:36:29.489 --> 00:36:32.249
Now use your intention to draw in

527
00:36:32.249 --> 00:36:35.119
all appropriate magnetic lines.

528
00:36:36.487 --> 00:36:38.588
Reinforce this by visualizing them

529
00:36:38.588 --> 00:36:40.718
moving toward your temple.

530
00:36:42.087 --> 00:36:44.088
And as you hold this image,

531
00:36:44.088 --> 00:36:47.927
say out loud, by my conscious intent,

532
00:36:47.927 --> 00:36:51.608
I ask that the earth's lines of magnetic energy

533
00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:54.968
be drawn to this location for the purpose

534
00:36:54.968 --> 00:36:58.888
of creating a temple of light for the highest good

535
00:36:58.888 --> 00:37:03.378
of the local spirit and for the highest good of all.

536
00:37:07.247 --> 00:37:09.588
Again you can choose your own words,

537
00:37:09.588 --> 00:37:12.878
but be very very specific in your request.

538
00:37:20.408 --> 00:37:22.508
Assuming the request is appropriate,

539
00:37:22.508 --> 00:37:24.688
one or more magnetic lines are vected

540
00:37:24.688 --> 00:37:28.408
instantaneously, you should find that the change

541
00:37:28.408 --> 00:37:31.048
in the local landscape is both immediate

542
00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:33.558
and measurable through dosing.

543
00:37:34.588 --> 00:37:36.647
Those that are more sensitive will feel a rise

544
00:37:36.647 --> 00:37:40.177
in temperature, or a tingle in the lower arms.

545
00:37:41.328 --> 00:37:43.448
Some may even feel off-balance,

546
00:37:43.448 --> 00:37:46.818
as if pushed aside by an invisible hand.

547
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:52.288
Now that we have attracted two essential elements

548
00:37:52.288 --> 00:37:54.248
to our temple in progress,

549
00:37:54.248 --> 00:37:57.738
we can being to define the exact space of the temple.

550
00:38:00.948 --> 00:38:03.027
The third principle of temple making

551
00:38:03.027 --> 00:38:05.197
is sacred measure.

552
00:38:42.207 --> 00:38:45.428
Because a portal is essentially a microcosm of all

553
00:38:45.428 --> 00:38:48.858
universal forces at work in one place,

554
00:38:49.868 --> 00:38:51.927
applying a punitive measure that is derived

555
00:38:51.927 --> 00:38:55.388
from the very particles of which that is based,

556
00:38:55.388 --> 00:38:57.988
will generate another level of resonance

557
00:38:57.988 --> 00:38:59.878
with cosmic forces.

558
00:39:01.388 --> 00:39:03.028
So as you might guess,

559
00:39:03.028 --> 00:39:04.948
the temple builders didn't settle for some

560
00:39:04.948 --> 00:39:07.167
ordinarily unitive measure when it came

561
00:39:07.167 --> 00:39:09.297
to constructing their buildings.

562
00:39:15.088 --> 00:39:16.688
To understand how they arrive at

563
00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:20.128
creating the perfect unitive measure of the temples,

564
00:39:20.128 --> 00:39:23.377
let's take a look at how the universe is constructed.

565
00:39:30.948 --> 00:39:33.348
The primary building blocks of matter

566
00:39:33.348 --> 00:39:36.978
are the sphere and the tetrohedron.

567
00:39:37.367 --> 00:39:40.518
They are the glue of the universe.

568
00:39:41.687 --> 00:39:45.128
When a tetra hedron is circumscribed within a sphere,

569
00:39:45.128 --> 00:39:48.108
the surface areas of these two geometric solids

570
00:39:48.108 --> 00:39:52.917
are in proportion to each other by a ratio of 2.72.

571
00:39:56.208 --> 00:39:58.948
This paring of the sphere and the tetrahedron

572
00:39:58.948 --> 00:40:01.328
is seen on earth is seen as the most essential

573
00:40:01.328 --> 00:40:04.918
chemical substance to all life, water.

574
00:40:07.348 --> 00:40:09.008
Water is made up from the bond of

575
00:40:09.008 --> 00:40:11.518
hydrogen and oxygen molecules.

576
00:40:12.708 --> 00:40:14.408
And the distance between these molecules

577
00:40:14.408 --> 00:40:18.317
measures precisely 2.72 angstroms.

578
00:40:21.228 --> 00:40:25.608
This numerical ratio 2.72 is also found

579
00:40:25.608 --> 00:40:29.007
in the values representing the sun and the moon.

580
00:40:29.007 --> 00:40:32.717
Without which, life on earth would be slightly difficult.

581
00:40:35.067 --> 00:40:40.067
The solar year consists of 365.242 days.

582
00:40:42.487 --> 00:40:45.736
By comparison, the lunar year is just

583
00:40:45.736 --> 00:40:49.296
354.367 days.

584
00:40:51.185 --> 00:40:55.376
The difference between the two is 10.875 days.

585
00:40:57.266 --> 00:41:00.246
If you divide this number by the full lunar month

586
00:41:00.246 --> 00:41:03.533
of 29.53 days,

587
00:41:03.533 --> 00:41:06.704
you get 2.7154,

588
00:41:06.704 --> 00:41:11.494
reduced to two decimal places as 2.72.

589
00:41:13.943 --> 00:41:17.963
It seems then that this numerical value 2.72

590
00:41:17.963 --> 00:41:20.894
exists at many levels of reality.

591
00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:25.674
it can be said to be a trans-dimensional constant.

592
00:41:27.844 --> 00:41:30.124
It stands to reason that a unitive measure

593
00:41:30.124 --> 00:41:32.584
derive from such relationships

594
00:41:32.584 --> 00:41:35.504
not only establishes a connection to the elements

595
00:41:35.504 --> 00:41:37.584
that make up the universe,

596
00:41:37.584 --> 00:41:40.813
it also creates a bond with the earth itself.

597
00:41:42.643 --> 00:41:44.184
And the megalithic temple builders

598
00:41:44.184 --> 00:41:45.934
employ such a unit.

599
00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:49.874
It is called the megalithic yard.

600
00:41:51.263 --> 00:41:54.354
And it is precisely 2.72 feet.

601
00:41:57.343 --> 00:42:00.263
The megalithic yard was the system of measure

602
00:42:00.263 --> 00:42:03.944
employed in ancient temples, particularly the stone circles

603
00:42:03.944 --> 00:42:05.773
of the Celtic world.

604
00:42:12.623 --> 00:42:15.644
Let us now return to the place that we have designated

605
00:42:15.644 --> 00:42:17.693
as our future temple.

606
00:42:19.263 --> 00:42:21.843
If you will recall, we have already vetted larger

607
00:42:21.843 --> 00:42:25.724
magnetic energy and also vents of underground water

608
00:42:25.724 --> 00:42:27.134
to the area.

609
00:42:28.483 --> 00:42:30.663
Let us now apply the megalithic yard

610
00:42:30.663 --> 00:42:34.094
as the physical foundation of our modern day temple.

611
00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:37.563
For the purpose of this demonstration,

612
00:42:37.563 --> 00:42:40.813
we're going to create a simple circular temple.

613
00:42:50.162 --> 00:42:54.071
We begin by measuring a radius with three megalithic yards.

614
00:42:54.941 --> 00:42:57.971
That's three units of 2.72 feet.

615
00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:06.260
Obviously it is not easy to accurately measure

616
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.579
in units of 2.72 feet, even though it translates roughly

617
00:43:10.579 --> 00:43:12.329
to 33-inches.

618
00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:16.118
But we wish to be a precise as possible.

619
00:43:16.118 --> 00:43:18.289
So this is where intent helps.

620
00:43:19.859 --> 00:43:22.298
Measure out the radius of your temple,

621
00:43:22.298 --> 00:43:24.129
as accurately as you can.

622
00:43:25.219 --> 00:43:27.779
Then using your intent,

623
00:43:27.779 --> 00:43:29.919
focus on the precise number

624
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:31.989
you are trying to physically measure.

625
00:43:33.279 --> 00:43:35.399
This compensates for any discrepancy

626
00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:37.129
in the physical.

627
00:43:38.558 --> 00:43:40.319
How can this be so.

628
00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:43.628
Well your intent is electro magnetic.

629
00:43:44.418 --> 00:43:47.189
Therefor its resonance is super physical.

630
00:43:48.038 --> 00:43:50.719
In other words, the vibration of intent

631
00:43:50.719 --> 00:43:54.609
supersedes anything that exists in gross physical form.

632
00:43:57.659 --> 00:43:59.939
The success of the outcome is amplified

633
00:43:59.939 --> 00:44:02.258
by the power of your belief.

634
00:44:02.258 --> 00:44:04.978
And the more you believe, the more your thought

635
00:44:04.978 --> 00:44:07.227
is given form in reality.

636
00:44:08.057 --> 00:44:10.968
That is the power of human intent.

637
00:44:34.118 --> 00:44:37.748
Using the megalithic yard as the foundation of our temple,

638
00:44:38.178 --> 00:44:40.917
means that from now on, any structure we create

639
00:44:40.917 --> 00:44:43.458
within this space, will be influenced

640
00:44:43.458 --> 00:44:45.855
by the harmonics of this measure.

641
00:44:45.855 --> 00:44:49.125
As well as its connection to universal forces.

642
00:44:55.196 --> 00:44:58.755
Now that we have defined a specific area for a temple,

643
00:44:58.755 --> 00:45:01.816
we must direct those water and magnetic lines

644
00:45:01.816 --> 00:45:04.214
already in the general vicinity

645
00:45:04.214 --> 00:45:06.543
into our portal in progress.

646
00:45:13.694 --> 00:45:17.503
And that brings us to the fourth principle of temple making.

647
00:46:00.771 --> 00:46:04.171
Because of their nature, magnetic lines are influenced

648
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:06.681
by terrestrial and solar events.

649
00:46:08.411 --> 00:46:11.091
And so they constantly meander about the land

650
00:46:11.091 --> 00:46:14.792
like serpents, hence their traditional association

651
00:46:14.792 --> 00:46:16.741
with things that slither.

652
00:46:21.832 --> 00:46:23.532
So in ancient times,

653
00:46:23.532 --> 00:46:25.751
if you wanted to facilitate a meeting place

654
00:46:25.751 --> 00:46:28.011
for cosmic and terrestrial forces,

655
00:46:28.011 --> 00:46:31.401
it became necessary to root this energy to this spot.

656
00:46:33.692 --> 00:46:37.342
In essence you'd be performing a kind of earth acupuncture.

657
00:46:39.711 --> 00:46:42.981
And the way it was done was by programming stone.

658
00:46:47.652 --> 00:46:50.161
And not just any kind of stone mind you.

659
00:46:50.912 --> 00:46:52.771
When you examine sacred sites

660
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:55.131
including churches and cathedrals,

661
00:46:55.131 --> 00:46:58.211
it is obvious that specific types of stones were used

662
00:46:58.211 --> 00:47:00.661
for specific purposes.

663
00:47:02.331 --> 00:47:04.951
Clearly this was by design because some of them

664
00:47:04.951 --> 00:47:08.661
were transported from as much as 400 miles away.

665
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:23.762
Stone used in temples has a high content of quartz.

666
00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:30.071
In fact, the type of quartz in the blue stones

667
00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:33.601
of stone hedge is also found in early radios.

668
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:40.961
Quartz is a piezo electric material.

669
00:47:41.311 --> 00:47:43.771
Therefore just like a modern day computer,

670
00:47:43.771 --> 00:47:46.281
it possesses energetic properties.

671
00:47:47.271 --> 00:47:49.461
And it can be programmed.

672
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:52.351
And throughout the temple making world.

673
00:47:52.351 --> 00:47:55.341
the programming was done through intent.

674
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:11.551
There are three genders of temple,

675
00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:15.561
male... female...

676
00:48:17.868 --> 00:48:19.539
and balanced.

677
00:48:21.028 --> 00:48:24.359
And each gender is reflected in the choice of stone.

678
00:48:28.429 --> 00:48:31.048
Masculine energy was symbolized by the force

679
00:48:31.048 --> 00:48:32.538
of the sun.

680
00:48:34.369 --> 00:48:37.188
And this force was mirrored on earth in rock

681
00:48:37.188 --> 00:48:39.598
created through volcanic action.

682
00:48:42.388 --> 00:48:46.068
So when creating a temple that favors male energy,

683
00:48:46.068 --> 00:48:49.478
always use stone of volcanic origin.

684
00:48:51.048 --> 00:48:52.398
Granites...

685
00:48:55.248 --> 00:48:56.938
basalt...

686
00:49:01.028 --> 00:49:04.398
dolorite... greenstone...

687
00:49:07.248 --> 00:49:09.278
or serpentine.

688
00:49:13.348 --> 00:49:15.708
Red granite is particularly favored

689
00:49:15.708 --> 00:49:18.668
because it has a very high content of quartz

690
00:49:18.668 --> 00:49:23.138
as well as iron, the ingredient found in human blood.

691
00:49:25.608 --> 00:49:28.428
Carefully applied, it can have a significant effect

692
00:49:28.428 --> 00:49:31.888
on a person, hence why it was a stern choice

693
00:49:31.888 --> 00:49:33.878
in the core of pyramids.

694
00:49:34.788 --> 00:49:38.948
And later as the foundation stone of alters and churches,

695
00:49:38.948 --> 00:49:43.538
and that is precisely why they are called altars.

696
00:49:49.088 --> 00:49:51.249
By contrast the force of the moon

697
00:49:51.249 --> 00:49:53.238
was considered female.

698
00:49:54.369 --> 00:49:57.348
This is because of the moon's effect on tides

699
00:49:57.348 --> 00:50:01.028
and fertility cycles as well as the life of the moon

700
00:50:01.028 --> 00:50:04.698
being a reflection of the light from the masculine sun.

701
00:50:09.268 --> 00:50:11.948
This lunar force is therefore mirrored in stone

702
00:50:11.948 --> 00:50:14.179
born of the action of water.

703
00:50:16.828 --> 00:50:19.769
And so, stone of sedimentary origin

704
00:50:19.769 --> 00:50:21.989
is the preferred choice in temples

705
00:50:21.989 --> 00:50:24.139
that work with feminine energy.

706
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:27.659
And these are limestone,

707
00:50:33.948 --> 00:50:35.299
sandstone...

708
00:50:40.089 --> 00:50:43.839
sarcen which is a highly compressed santstone.

709
00:50:48.338 --> 00:50:49.838
Marble...

710
00:50:52.387 --> 00:50:54.097
alabaster...

711
00:50:54.566 --> 00:50:58.006
and finally schist which is not sedimentary in origin

712
00:50:58.006 --> 00:50:59.677
but metamorphic.

713
00:51:01.347 --> 00:51:04.206
Yet since it is formed by the action of water,

714
00:51:04.206 --> 00:51:06.766
and the compression of material at the time,

715
00:51:06.766 --> 00:51:09.937
it too is also considered a feminine stone.

716
00:51:19.607 --> 00:51:22.306
There is one point of departure that only occurs

717
00:51:22.306 --> 00:51:23.917
in male temples.

718
00:51:25.046 --> 00:51:27.147
And that is that all male temples

719
00:51:27.147 --> 00:51:30.757
include one female element in order to work.

720
00:51:33.047 --> 00:51:36.566
This is because purely male energy cannot creation motion

721
00:51:36.566 --> 00:51:37.875
all by itself.

722
00:51:40.486 --> 00:51:43.326
An example of this is how the poles of two magnets

723
00:51:43.326 --> 00:51:46.765
will join together when aligned female to female

724
00:51:46.765 --> 00:51:50.184
and male to female, but will repel

725
00:51:50.184 --> 00:51:52.414
when placed male to male.

726
00:51:57.164 --> 00:52:01.084
Solar temples such as the alter room at Edfu in Egypt,

727
00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:04.124
contain the male red granite surrounded

728
00:52:04.124 --> 00:52:05.993
by the female sandstone.

729
00:52:08.464 --> 00:52:11.003
The amount of female stone is not important.

730
00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:13.554
So long as one element is present.

731
00:52:16.844 --> 00:52:20.144
Greek temples dedicated to Athena or Diana

732
00:52:20.144 --> 00:52:23.423
are an excellent examples of lunar female temples

733
00:52:23.423 --> 00:52:26.534
and they use marble on marble.

734
00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:32.084
Some temples vet a combination

735
00:52:32.084 --> 00:52:34.293
of male and female energy.

736
00:52:35.124 --> 00:52:36.904
These are places originally designed

737
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:39.784
for balance and the intent is reflected

738
00:52:39.784 --> 00:52:42.144
in the mix of granite and limestones

739
00:52:42.144 --> 00:52:43.934
and sandstones.

740
00:52:49.304 --> 00:52:52.764
Stone Hedge which is a lunar as well as a solar temple

741
00:52:52.764 --> 00:52:57.264
uses female sarcen stones and blue stone,

742
00:52:57.264 --> 00:53:00.803
the high density granite with unusual properties

743
00:53:00.803 --> 00:53:03.693
quarried far away in Whales.

744
00:53:17.322 --> 00:53:19.963
Because of the changes in society and styles,

745
00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:22.901
it may not be convenient, even visually alluring

746
00:53:22.901 --> 00:53:25.371
to deposit stones in your home.

747
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.861
Particularly in a modern urban setting.

748
00:53:27.861 --> 00:53:29.831
Where space is limited.

749
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.461
So for those of us who live in apartments,

750
00:53:33.461 --> 00:53:35.231
there is a solution.

751
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:38.211
Substitute stones for crystals.

752
00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:42.341
Although they are inherent in the stone,

753
00:53:42.341 --> 00:53:44.521
crystals were never specifically used

754
00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:46.141
in the structure of the temples

755
00:53:46.141 --> 00:53:48.951
because of their unsuitability as building material.

756
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:54.681
And yet crystals possess similar energetic characteristics

757
00:53:54.681 --> 00:53:56.111
to stone.

758
00:53:58.121 --> 00:54:01.410
The prime neutral crystal is clear quartz.

759
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:05.260
It is a pure, androgynous element

760
00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.500
and therefore it can be programmed

761
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.331
to swing either way.

762
00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:13.001
The energy polarity of crystals

763
00:54:13.001 --> 00:54:16.450
is reflected in the energetic qualities of their names.

764
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.401
Words are after all, mental interpretations

765
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:23.031
of underlying causes and effects.

766
00:54:24.741 --> 00:54:28.341
Therefore a name with an imposing dominant tone

767
00:54:28.341 --> 00:54:32.261
such as Ruby or agate describes

768
00:54:32.261 --> 00:54:34.151
a male energy.

769
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.301
On the other hand, emerald

770
00:54:38.301 --> 00:54:42.541
or lapis lazuli evoke a flowing energy

771
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:45.401
just like water, and such crystals

772
00:54:45.401 --> 00:54:47.530
are considered female.

773
00:54:50.381 --> 00:54:53.400
If you wish to construct a temple of balanced energy,

774
00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.630
simply mix the two types of crystal.

775
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.131
Just as you would using stone.

776
00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:01.861
Or you can use labradorite,

777
00:55:01.861 --> 00:55:04.241
which is one of the few gems that incorporates

778
00:55:04.241 --> 00:55:06.781
both elements of the sacred masculine

779
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:08.691
and the feminine.

780
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.781
So let's return to the area we have already define

781
00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:19.471
for our temple.

782
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:28.060
At this moment, we place male and female stones

783
00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.540
to physically mark the circumference of the area

784
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.390
we had measured using the megalithic yard.

785
00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.111
Placing the stones by themselves doesn't create anything.

786
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.900
Because at this point, they are simply lumps

787
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.570
of solidified energy.

788
00:56:51.861 --> 00:56:54.180
But the moment we send them attention,

789
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.860
and we give them intention,

790
00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.290
that's when magic begins to happen.

791
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:06.571
So send your attention to every stone around the perimeter.

792
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.170
Hold their shape in your mind.

793
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.701
Their weight, their texture,

794
00:57:14.701 --> 00:57:17.821
and as you hold these images,

795
00:57:17.821 --> 00:57:21.580
consciously send out your intent to these stones.

796
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.207
And say to yourself

797
00:57:25.317 --> 00:57:27.117
by my conscious intent,

798
00:57:27.117 --> 00:57:30.378
I ask these stones to anchor the veins of water

799
00:57:30.378 --> 00:57:32.658
and the lives of magnetic energy

800
00:57:32.658 --> 00:57:34.678
to this designated space

801
00:57:34.678 --> 00:57:38.297
for the purpose of creating a temple of light

802
00:57:38.297 --> 00:57:41.167
for the highest good of the local spirit.

803
00:57:41.878 --> 00:57:44.207
And for the highest good of all.

804
00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:49.167
It is done.

805
00:57:50.637 --> 00:57:53.637
You will find that where the width of the magnetic lines

806
00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:56.137
previously encompassed the general area

807
00:57:56.137 --> 00:57:58.537
of this temple in progress,

808
00:57:58.537 --> 00:58:00.877
these same lines have now been attracted

809
00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:03.867
to the stones which carry your intent.

810
00:58:06.517 --> 00:58:08.357
The energy field is now glued

811
00:58:08.357 --> 00:58:10.617
to the exact perimeter of the area

812
00:58:10.617 --> 00:58:12.387
you have intended.

813
00:58:15.097 --> 00:58:18.037
At this point those who are more sensitive,

814
00:58:18.037 --> 00:58:20.377
will notice that a subtle energy field

815
00:58:20.377 --> 00:58:23.587
has also begun to build around the perimeter.

816
00:58:24.837 --> 00:58:26.758
It resembles a series of ripples

817
00:58:26.758 --> 00:58:28.877
that radiate away from the perimeter

818
00:58:28.877 --> 00:58:32.117
as if the temple is a rock that is suddenly been thrown

819
00:58:32.117 --> 00:58:34.367
into a pool of energy.

820
00:58:38.637 --> 00:58:40.877
Magnetic energy is not only concentrating

821
00:58:40.877 --> 00:58:42.977
around the perimeter of the temple,

822
00:58:42.977 --> 00:58:45.577
it has also begun to spin inside it

823
00:58:45.577 --> 00:58:48.538
creating a slow motion vortex that will build

824
00:58:48.538 --> 00:58:50.127
as we progress.

825
00:58:54.077 --> 00:58:57.517
So let us recap what we have accomplished so far,

826
00:58:57.517 --> 00:59:01.048
we have discovered the law of attraction,

827
00:59:01.637 --> 00:59:05.187
and how it can be used to move and influence energy.

828
00:59:07.237 --> 00:59:09.517
We located a suitable piece of land

829
00:59:09.517 --> 00:59:12.267
where we wish to build a portal of energy.

830
00:59:14.077 --> 00:59:16.718
Then we applied the power of that attention

831
00:59:16.718 --> 00:59:20.057
and intention to draw the veins of underground water

832
00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:21.807
to this area.

833
00:59:23.277 --> 00:59:25.518
We repeated the process to vector the lines

834
00:59:25.518 --> 00:59:27.288
of magnetic energy.

835
00:59:30.478 --> 00:59:32.878
Next we define the area of the temple

836
00:59:32.878 --> 00:59:36.607
by using the megalithic yard as the unitive measure.

837
00:59:37.898 --> 00:59:40.428
(guitar riffs)

838
00:59:56.297 --> 00:59:59.157
And finally, we physically define the temple

839
00:59:59.157 --> 01:00:01.417
by placing male and female stones

840
01:00:01.417 --> 01:00:03.128
around the circumference.

841
01:00:04.837 --> 01:00:07.978
And when we gave those stones attention and intention,

842
01:00:07.978 --> 01:00:10.617
the wondering lines of water and magnetism

843
01:00:10.617 --> 01:00:13.207
were drawn to that exact area.

844
01:00:15.257 --> 01:00:16.937
So in a short space of time,

845
01:00:16.937 --> 01:00:20.348
we have begun to create a portal of energy on the land,

846
01:00:26.257 --> 01:00:28.858
Next we must give that energy purpose,

847
01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:32.417
and for that we must apply sacred geometry

848
01:00:32.417 --> 01:00:34.807
to the positioning of the stones.

849
01:00:35.737 --> 01:00:39.608
Which brings us to the fifth principal of temple making.

850
01:00:54.077 --> 01:00:56.677
Before we examine the fifth principle,

851
01:00:56.677 --> 01:00:58.527
here is a simple test for you.

852
01:00:59.337 --> 01:01:01.467
There are no wrong or right answers,

853
01:01:02.097 --> 01:01:05.008
just responses which are appropriate only for yourself.

854
01:01:06.817 --> 01:01:08.458
Without thinking about it,

855
01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:12.387
what immediately comes to mind when you see this?

856
01:01:17.737 --> 01:01:20.908
What images or feelings does it evoke?

857
01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:29.727
Does the shape feel static or dynamic?

858
01:01:33.278 --> 01:01:36.307
Does it feel contracted or expansive?

859
01:01:40.657 --> 01:01:42.427
Clear your mind.

860
01:01:43.717 --> 01:01:46.438
Now what emotions immediately come to mind

861
01:01:46.438 --> 01:01:48.408
when you see this?

862
01:01:52.197 --> 01:01:55.187
What images or feelings does it evoke?

863
01:01:57.697 --> 01:02:00.367
Does the shape feel static or dynamic?

864
01:02:06.578 --> 01:02:09.567
Does it feel contractive or expansive?

865
01:02:13.517 --> 01:02:15.767
Clear your mind again.

866
01:02:17.378 --> 01:02:19.597
Now what emotions immediately come to mind

867
01:02:19.597 --> 01:02:21.808
when you see this?

868
01:02:25.598 --> 01:02:28.247
What images or feelings does it evoke?

869
01:02:30.897 --> 01:02:33.647
Does the shape feel static or dynamic?

870
01:02:36.077 --> 01:02:38.968
Does it feel contractive or expansive?

871
01:02:43.797 --> 01:02:47.147
Each shape probably elicits a difference reactions.

872
01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:50.958
You see just like you, the geometric shape is

873
01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:54.107
a condensed whirlpool of atoms and molecules.

874
01:02:55.597 --> 01:02:57.477
And shapes change according to changes

875
01:02:57.477 --> 01:03:00.227
in the resonance and vibrations of molecules.

876
01:03:02.158 --> 01:03:05.297
These images show how changes in sound frequency

877
01:03:05.297 --> 01:03:09.087
alters the geometry of sound when it is captured in liquid.

878
01:03:12.117 --> 01:03:14.198
Different shapes are also a reflection

879
01:03:14.198 --> 01:03:17.107
of their underlying consciousness and purpose.

880
01:03:20.218 --> 01:03:22.597
When form interacts with the human body,

881
01:03:22.597 --> 01:03:25.037
particularly in a physical environment,

882
01:03:25.037 --> 01:03:27.827
it stimulates its senses and emotions.

883
01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:32.337
The word emotion is very apt

884
01:03:32.337 --> 01:03:35.647
because it literally means energy in motion.

885
01:03:38.438 --> 01:03:41.368
Welcome to the world of sacred geometry.

886
01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:07.978
Throughout ancient times,

887
01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:10.317
the pillars, walls, and elements of temples

888
01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:14.407
were arranged according to specific geometric laws.

889
01:04:15.097 --> 01:04:17.357
Because it was known that certain alignments influenced

890
01:04:17.357 --> 01:04:20.537
the way molecules flow, thus setting the tone

891
01:04:20.537 --> 01:04:22.528
for a local environment.

892
01:04:24.118 --> 01:04:25.717
If you ever visited a temple,

893
01:04:25.717 --> 01:04:28.187
you probably experienced the sensation.

894
01:04:31.057 --> 01:04:32.697
Just like entering a house,

895
01:04:32.697 --> 01:04:35.267
some temples make you feel right at home.

896
01:04:35.977 --> 01:04:38.167
While others make you feel unwelcome.

897
01:04:48.057 --> 01:04:51.307
Since human DNA is based on geometric structure,

898
01:04:52.217 --> 01:04:55.158
the human body's energy field is sensitive to the harmonic

899
01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:57.727
of the environment in which it stands.

900
01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:02.358
Therefore by considering the appropriate geometry,

901
01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:05.377
the temple builders discovered that a specific resonance

902
01:05:05.377 --> 01:05:09.627
was exchanged between a stone temple and a human temple.

903
01:05:12.297 --> 01:05:15.417
Before we consider the different shapes of sacred geometry.

904
01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:19.087
Let's take a look at some examples of how these applied.

905
01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:23.818
Anyone who has experienced the pyramids of Giza,

906
01:05:23.818 --> 01:05:25.777
even from a photograph,

907
01:05:25.777 --> 01:05:27.717
cannot deny the effect these buildings

908
01:05:27.717 --> 01:05:29.548
have on your awareness.

909
01:05:31.297 --> 01:05:34.577
The effect is deliberately induced in part of

910
01:05:34.577 --> 01:05:37.655
by the choice of the great pyramids slope angle.

911
01:05:37.655 --> 01:05:40.385
Which is based on the angle of a hectagon.

912
01:05:40.916 --> 01:05:43.535
A seven-pointed geometric figure that is analogous

913
01:05:43.535 --> 01:05:45.465
to the pure music scale.

914
01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:50.375
The same geometry is reflected in the angle of the

915
01:05:50.375 --> 01:05:52.606
building's main passageway.

916
01:05:54.235 --> 01:05:56.616
If you've ever walked inside this temple,

917
01:05:56.616 --> 01:05:58.555
you will know just how disorientating

918
01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:00.265
the effect can be.

919
01:06:02.355 --> 01:06:04.655
This deliberate sensory manipualtion

920
01:06:04.655 --> 01:06:07.915
is designed to open your body's electrical circuits

921
01:06:07.915 --> 01:06:10.755
in order to make it more receptive to finer,

922
01:06:10.755 --> 01:06:14.045
more penetrating frequencies.

923
01:06:16.176 --> 01:06:18.215
The supreme art of sacred geometry

924
01:06:18.215 --> 01:06:21.026
lies in the way it can be hidden from view.

925
01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:26.646
Literally made occult which means conceal from the eye.

926
01:06:28.676 --> 01:06:31.396
What looks like a plan made of repeating squares

927
01:06:31.396 --> 01:06:32.975
and concentric circles,

928
01:06:32.975 --> 01:06:36.725
is in reality a well crafted series of geometric forms.

929
01:06:37.796 --> 01:06:40.015
And the entrances tears and bell towers of

930
01:06:40.015 --> 01:06:42.435
this Indonesian monument are all positioned

931
01:06:42.435 --> 01:06:46.185
in harmonic proportion to specific geometric forms.

932
01:06:54.375 --> 01:06:57.285
This ancestral knowledge was not lost in time.

933
01:06:57.976 --> 01:06:59.815
But re-emerged in Europe after centuries

934
01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.576
of religious persecution.

935
01:07:01.576 --> 01:07:03.865
In the layouts of Gothic Cathedrals.

936
01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.176
The alignment of pillars, walls, and the labyrinth

937
01:07:08.176 --> 01:07:11.835
of charteau testify to the continuous use of this art

938
01:07:11.835 --> 01:07:15.205
and it's affect are still palpable today.

939
01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:24.295
The use of sacred geometry is cunningly concealed

940
01:07:24.295 --> 01:07:27.795
in simple temples such as castle rig stone circle

941
01:07:27.795 --> 01:07:29.206
in Combria.

942
01:07:30.376 --> 01:07:32.856
This cartoid shape is based on the intersection

943
01:07:32.856 --> 01:07:36.055
of two equal circles, representing the duality

944
01:07:36.055 --> 01:07:37.505
of the creator.

945
01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:40.356
Revealing that most sacred of all shapes,

946
01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:44.145
the vesc of pisces, symbol of the divine femine.

947
01:07:46.075 --> 01:07:47.615
From the womb of this form,

948
01:07:47.615 --> 01:07:50.345
one can generate all the forms of sacred geometry.

949
01:07:57.375 --> 01:07:59.116
Just in case you are feeling that all this

950
01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:02.926
is all above your ability and not practical in modern life,

951
01:08:03.975 --> 01:08:06.215
consider the use of sacred geometry in a humble

952
01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.885
stone circle off the coast of Scotland.

953
01:08:11.475 --> 01:08:14.756
And yet this simple temple comprising nine stones

954
01:08:14.756 --> 01:08:16.955
is one of the most powerful temples in this

955
01:08:16.955 --> 01:08:18.565
part of the world.

956
01:08:20.016 --> 01:08:22.835
It shows that the use of sacred geometry can be a simple

957
01:08:22.835 --> 01:08:26.005
or as involved as one wishes it to be.

958
01:08:27.175 --> 01:08:29.535
And the quality of its effect depends largely on

959
01:08:29.535 --> 01:08:33.236
how it is used and the quality of the intent applied

960
01:08:33.236 --> 01:08:36.866
and accumulated over time at the same location.

961
01:08:39.736 --> 01:08:41.955
The same geometry of that stone circle

962
01:08:41.955 --> 01:08:44.655
along with the other principles taught in this program

963
01:08:44.655 --> 01:08:47.616
were used to create a striking stone circle

964
01:08:47.616 --> 01:08:49.795
that is now a place of meditation

965
01:08:49.795 --> 01:08:52.246
in a garden in British Columbia.

966
01:08:54.276 --> 01:08:56.796
So all of this stuff is very practical,

967
01:08:56.796 --> 01:08:58.805
even in our modern day culture.

968
01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:03.766
So where does sacred geometry actually come from?

969
01:09:04.855 --> 01:09:07.235
It may come as no surprise that it was all distilled

970
01:09:07.235 --> 01:09:10.645
from the observation of universal laws and processes.

971
01:09:16.056 --> 01:09:18.435
Like the stones they so carefully chose,

972
01:09:18.435 --> 01:09:20.835
the temple makers considered geometric forms

973
01:09:20.835 --> 01:09:23.525
to be expressions of consciousness.

974
01:09:24.515 --> 01:09:27.195
Thanks to the development of the electro microscope,

975
01:09:27.195 --> 01:09:29.906
We can see that their idea was correct.

976
01:09:30.855 --> 01:09:33.555
That the most basic of all living organisms on earth

977
01:09:33.555 --> 01:09:37.646
the single celled diatons, are simple geometric forms.

978
01:09:44.155 --> 01:09:47.235
The temple makers recognized that all earthly life

979
01:09:47.235 --> 01:09:49.256
was a mirror of actions taking place

980
01:09:49.256 --> 01:09:50.946
in the world above.

981
01:09:51.715 --> 01:09:53.895
So they examined the heavens and discovered

982
01:09:53.895 --> 01:09:56.515
the same geometry occurs in the moon orbits

983
01:09:56.515 --> 01:09:59.406
of those large molecules that circle the heavens.

984
01:10:01.135 --> 01:10:04.235
Since the heavens were the orderly domain of the gods,

985
01:10:04.235 --> 01:10:06.536
and the planets dwelled there,

986
01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.625
the celestial order was laying sacred geometry.

987
01:10:11.595 --> 01:10:13.655
And because this geometry reflected the perfect

988
01:10:13.655 --> 01:10:15.675
machinery of the universe,

989
01:10:15.675 --> 01:10:17.655
they reasoned that by applying it

990
01:10:17.655 --> 01:10:19.495
in the design of their temples,

991
01:10:19.495 --> 01:10:21.155
they would create an environment

992
01:10:21.155 --> 01:10:23.315
where balance and harmony could be restored

993
01:10:23.315 --> 01:10:27.326
across this sometimes imperfect environment called earth.

994
01:10:30.295 --> 01:10:33.375
And if a person walked in, in a state of this ease,

995
01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:35.955
through the transfer of these harmonics,

996
01:10:35.955 --> 01:10:38.495
they would walk out again feeling wholy

997
01:10:38.495 --> 01:10:42.745
or as we say today, holy.

998
01:10:48.935 --> 01:10:51.315
Since the angles used in geometry are unique

999
01:10:51.315 --> 01:10:54.575
to each shape, the type of geometry used

1000
01:10:54.575 --> 01:10:58.745
reflected the effect the temple makers wished to evoke,

1001
01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:02.355
This is one reason why different people

1002
01:11:02.355 --> 01:11:04.136
are attached to different temples

1003
01:11:04.136 --> 01:11:06.325
at different times in life.

1004
01:11:07.816 --> 01:11:10.335
Your own eternal geometry seeks to reconnect

1005
01:11:10.335 --> 01:11:12.735
with the order it needs to bring itself back

1006
01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:14.805
into perfect equilibrium.

1007
01:11:16.495 --> 01:11:18.596
It's just like your body wanting to go for a walk

1008
01:11:18.596 --> 01:11:21.815
in the country side for some harmony and fresh air

1009
01:11:21.815 --> 01:11:23.685
after a week of stress.

1010
01:11:28.715 --> 01:11:31.756
So let's take a look at the seven principle geometries

1011
01:11:31.756 --> 01:11:34.425
and see what each one of them does.

1012
01:11:39.015 --> 01:11:42.545
The triangle represents the free-fold nature of light.

1013
01:11:43.535 --> 01:11:45.725
The creative heart of the universe.

1014
01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.636
This is epitomized in Christian art

1015
01:11:48.636 --> 01:11:50.895
where god is the only individual depicted

1016
01:11:50.895 --> 01:11:52.886
in triangular halo.

1017
01:11:54.655 --> 01:11:57.935
The triangle is the perfect equilibrium of manifestation

1018
01:11:57.935 --> 01:12:00.825
is represented in the Christian holy trinity.

1019
01:12:01.795 --> 01:12:05.266
And in nature, as the bond of father, mother, child.

1020
01:12:06.695 --> 01:12:08.675
In our modern electric world,

1021
01:12:08.675 --> 01:12:12.516
computer and tv screens require a three-fold source

1022
01:12:12.516 --> 01:12:16.126
to recreate white light and the visible telespectrum.

1023
01:12:18.756 --> 01:12:21.114
The triangles three dimensional counterpart

1024
01:12:21.114 --> 01:12:23.714
the tetrahedron is the primary shape

1025
01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:25.824
that bonds atoms together.

1026
01:12:28.074 --> 01:12:30.293
By positioning the elements of a temple,

1027
01:12:30.293 --> 01:12:33.113
according to the angles and harmonics of the triangle,

1028
01:12:33.113 --> 01:12:37.293
you invoke the properties of strength, stability,

1029
01:12:37.293 --> 01:12:39.463
and perfect equilibrium.

1030
01:12:42.034 --> 01:12:44.254
The creative and dynamic power of three

1031
01:12:44.254 --> 01:12:47.093
is reflected in many of our everyday phrases

1032
01:12:47.093 --> 01:12:49.504
which are repeated three times.

1033
01:12:50.274 --> 01:12:53.923
Three wishes, three strikes, and so on.

1034
01:12:55.893 --> 01:12:58.793
Even in prayer and ceremony, the name of an angel

1035
01:12:58.793 --> 01:13:01.783
is invoked three times for best effect.

1036
01:13:02.873 --> 01:13:04.594
The first knowledge is the whole

1037
01:13:04.594 --> 01:13:06.713
and the second sets the male and female

1038
01:13:06.713 --> 01:13:08.423
aspect into motion.

1039
01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:12.003
And the third gives forward motion and creates.

1040
01:13:31.853 --> 01:13:34.553
Whereas the triangle reflects the equilibrium of forces

1041
01:13:34.553 --> 01:13:36.304
in the invisible plane,

1042
01:13:37.093 --> 01:13:39.413
its complimentary opposite the square,

1043
01:13:39.413 --> 01:13:42.563
invokes equilibrium of forces on the material plane.

1044
01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:46.754
Three dimensionally, the square and the triangle

1045
01:13:46.754 --> 01:13:49.704
are represented by the cube and the tetrahedron.

1046
01:13:50.334 --> 01:13:52.373
And the corners of the latter fit perfectly

1047
01:13:52.373 --> 01:13:54.123
inside the cube.

1048
01:13:55.073 --> 01:13:57.174
A striking metaphor of how the spiritual world

1049
01:13:57.174 --> 01:14:01.064
is bound within the material world, always.

1050
01:14:03.213 --> 01:14:05.153
When the elements of a temple are positioned

1051
01:14:05.153 --> 01:14:07.463
according to the harmonics of the square,

1052
01:14:08.293 --> 01:14:10.113
you invoke the balance of the four elements

1053
01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:14.104
of earth, air, fire, and water.

1054
01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:18.893
This is reflected in the fixed cardinal points

1055
01:14:18.893 --> 01:14:22.304
of north, south, east, and west.

1056
01:14:23.173 --> 01:14:24.493
Which allow us to find our bearings

1057
01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.404
along the three dimensional world.

1058
01:14:27.013 --> 01:14:28.994
Even if there is some disagreement about this.

1059
01:14:28.994 --> 01:14:31.244
Between women and men when they're driving.

1060
01:14:32.614 --> 01:14:35.313
Before directions help our spatial orientation

1061
01:14:35.313 --> 01:14:37.453
across the four corners of the globe,

1062
01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:40.353
and divide the year into four seasons,

1063
01:14:43.653 --> 01:14:45.473
since the elements of a square

1064
01:14:45.473 --> 01:14:47.393
are equidistant to eachother,

1065
01:14:47.393 --> 01:14:49.473
it is said that the properties of this geometry

1066
01:14:49.473 --> 01:14:53.123
are static, they are rooted, fixed.

1067
01:14:54.053 --> 01:14:57.343
And therefore, very much of the material world

1068
01:14:58.194 --> 01:15:00.353
you are connecting with the forces of the earth.

1069
01:15:00.353 --> 01:15:02.113
Hence why this shape is predominantly used by

1070
01:15:02.113 --> 01:15:04.303
native cultures such as the Navajo.

1071
01:15:40.933 --> 01:15:43.404
Next comes the five pointed pentagram.

1072
01:15:44.213 --> 01:15:46.434
Possibly the most pervasive geometric shape

1073
01:15:46.434 --> 01:15:48.104
in many cultures.

1074
01:15:49.073 --> 01:15:50.973
Perhaps this is due to its relationship

1075
01:15:50.973 --> 01:15:54.004
with the spiral that is found embedded within it.

1076
01:15:54.993 --> 01:15:58.583
For the same spiral is inherent in every organic life form.

1077
01:15:59.913 --> 01:16:03.363
This golden spiral is a spiral motion of life.

1078
01:16:05.454 --> 01:16:08.293
From galaxy and whirlpools,

1079
01:16:08.293 --> 01:16:10.743
to flowers and shells,

1080
01:16:12.413 --> 01:16:14.693
the pentagram is nature's proclomation

1081
01:16:14.693 --> 01:16:16.953
of triumph in the natural world.

1082
01:16:16.953 --> 01:16:18.993
So it's not surprising that the psychology

1083
01:16:18.993 --> 01:16:22.023
of such a shape found its way into our vernacular.

1084
01:16:23.034 --> 01:16:26.313
Five star reviews and five star hotels,

1085
01:16:26.313 --> 01:16:28.703
the stars of the silver screen,

1086
01:16:29.873 --> 01:16:32.904
we even put the pentagram on the flags on nations.

1087
01:16:34.234 --> 01:16:36.833
Since the pentagram is the flag of nature

1088
01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:40.603
working with it connects you with nature's living systems.

1089
01:16:41.632 --> 01:16:44.232
And because such principles are life affirming,

1090
01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.847
the shape invokes growth,

1091
01:16:46.847 --> 01:16:50.368
fertility, creativity,

1092
01:16:50.368 --> 01:16:55.298
intuition, and the power of the sacred feminine.

1093
01:16:58.667 --> 01:17:00.907
Traditional lunar temples are encoded with

1094
01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:02.486
pentagonal geometry.

1095
01:17:02.486 --> 01:17:04.526
In part because of the moon's influence

1096
01:17:04.526 --> 01:17:06.377
on the rhythm's of fertility.

1097
01:17:07.226 --> 01:17:09.936
Not to mention the ebb and flow of water.

1098
01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.266
Whereas the pentagram reflects the fluid nature

1099
01:17:43.266 --> 01:17:44.847
of living organisms,

1100
01:17:44.847 --> 01:17:47.227
the hexagon represents the rigid structure

1101
01:17:47.227 --> 01:17:48.846
of non-living things.

1102
01:17:48.846 --> 01:17:50.596
Such as crystals.

1103
01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:53.326
Just as living water solidifies into ice

1104
01:17:53.326 --> 01:17:55.997
and forms hexagonal shapes.

1105
01:17:56.987 --> 01:17:59.586
Since hexagonal shape implies rigidity,

1106
01:17:59.586 --> 01:18:02.236
it's qualities are considered masculine.

1107
01:18:03.866 --> 01:18:06.266
Arranging elements according to the hexagon

1108
01:18:06.266 --> 01:18:11.236
invokes structure, organization, and rationality.

1109
01:18:14.086 --> 01:18:17.386
The organizational hives of bees favor this shape.

1110
01:18:17.386 --> 01:18:19.867
As does modern microchip technology

1111
01:18:19.867 --> 01:18:22.367
which uses the hexagon as the geometry of choice

1112
01:18:22.367 --> 01:18:24.856
for sending and storing information.

1113
01:18:27.227 --> 01:18:30.527
And just as lunar temples are based on the pentagram,

1114
01:18:30.527 --> 01:18:33.877
temples based on the hexagon are considered solar.

1115
01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:01.966
Working with the seven-pointed heptagon

1116
01:19:01.966 --> 01:19:04.226
is to work with powerful elemental forces

1117
01:19:04.226 --> 01:19:05.856
that shape the universe.

1118
01:19:06.707 --> 01:19:08.327
Because the principle of seven

1119
01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.267
reflects the prime notes of sound

1120
01:19:10.267 --> 01:19:12.556
and the colors of visible light.

1121
01:19:14.366 --> 01:19:15.806
In the beginning, it is said

1122
01:19:15.806 --> 01:19:17.547
that the Egyptian god Ra

1123
01:19:17.547 --> 01:19:19.436
emitted a cry of light.

1124
01:19:23.106 --> 01:19:24.826
It is a mystery why should the heptagon

1125
01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:27.506
should be the only principle geometric shape

1126
01:19:27.506 --> 01:19:30.937
who's angles cannot be bisected to a whole number.

1127
01:19:33.167 --> 01:19:35.547
Therefore temples that work with this geometry

1128
01:19:35.547 --> 01:19:38.596
are invoking the energy of the unnoble.

1129
01:19:41.726 --> 01:19:43.827
And since both the source of the soul

1130
01:19:43.827 --> 01:19:45.976
and the universe are noble,

1131
01:19:46.706 --> 01:19:49.026
the heptagon equally represents the search for truth

1132
01:19:49.026 --> 01:19:50.656
and enlightenment.

1133
01:19:52.906 --> 01:19:55.267
Perhaps this is why the great pyramid of Giza

1134
01:19:55.267 --> 01:19:57.886
built on the foundation of a square

1135
01:19:57.886 --> 01:20:00.646
but with a slope angle based on the heptagon

1136
01:20:00.646 --> 01:20:03.327
is a symbol for so many people on a quest

1137
01:20:03.327 --> 01:20:05.536
for meaning in their lives.

1138
01:20:08.406 --> 01:20:09.926
The qualities of the heptagon

1139
01:20:09.926 --> 01:20:12.426
are personified in the statue of liberty

1140
01:20:12.426 --> 01:20:15.084
with its halo of seven rays,

1141
01:20:15.084 --> 01:20:17.914
symbolizing the search for truth and elightenment.

1142
01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.544
Because in doing so,

1143
01:20:21.544 --> 01:20:24.904
a person gains understanding and is thus liberated

1144
01:20:24.904 --> 01:20:27.834
from the illusions of the material world.

1145
01:20:29.924 --> 01:20:33.134
This symbol dates back to the Egyptian goddess Seshat,

1146
01:20:33.884 --> 01:20:37.363
the wife of Jehoti, the god of knowledge and illumination.

1147
01:20:37.363 --> 01:20:39.573
Whom the Greeks call Toth.

1148
01:20:42.403 --> 01:20:44.363
Because the heptagon is so synonymous

1149
01:20:44.363 --> 01:20:46.323
with prime creative forces,

1150
01:20:46.323 --> 01:20:49.143
it is not a geometry that should be used lightly.

1151
01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:52.453
As any misuse can have devastating consequences.

1152
01:20:53.723 --> 01:20:56.523
In times past, temples containing this geometry

1153
01:20:56.523 --> 01:20:58.723
came under the control of personal ego

1154
01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:02.063
and havoc was created across the face of the earth

1155
01:21:02.063 --> 01:21:05.783
is a geometry to work with only when you have

1156
01:21:05.783 --> 01:21:08.463
reached a level of confidence and responsibility

1157
01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.273
with your intent.

1158
01:21:36.203 --> 01:21:38.623
After the enlightenment has discovered through the

1159
01:21:38.623 --> 01:21:41.823
correct use of the heptagon comes the octagon.

1160
01:21:41.823 --> 01:21:44.663
The eight pointed figure representing complete balance

1161
01:21:44.663 --> 01:21:46.313
and stability.

1162
01:21:47.483 --> 01:21:50.303
Eight is walking that fine line between the material

1163
01:21:50.303 --> 01:21:53.993
and the immaterial, the heart and the mind.

1164
01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.813
The male and the female.

1165
01:22:00.443 --> 01:22:03.663
To work with the octagon is to invoke the ultimate aim

1166
01:22:03.663 --> 01:22:06.573
of what it means to be a fully aware human.

1167
01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:08.953
The christed human.

1168
01:22:09.443 --> 01:22:12.013
To be fully awake within your conscious self.

1169
01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:16.403
Historically, spiritual figures are admired

1170
01:22:16.403 --> 01:22:18.703
for their balanced nature are associated with

1171
01:22:18.703 --> 01:22:21.373
the octagon with the figure eight.

1172
01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.713
Or the infinity symbol.

1173
01:22:23.943 --> 01:22:28.613
Jesus, Mohammed, Merlin,

1174
01:22:28.613 --> 01:22:31.851
and the archangel Michael to name a few.

1175
01:22:34.161 --> 01:22:37.121
Balance in the heart and mind was the primary aim

1176
01:22:37.121 --> 01:22:39.271
of all esoteric cultures.

1177
01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:41.701
And it's geometry became synonymous

1178
01:22:41.701 --> 01:22:44.191
with the original Knight's Templars.

1179
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:47.501
The red cross represents mastery

1180
01:22:47.501 --> 01:22:50.081
of the four material forces in balance

1181
01:22:50.081 --> 01:22:53.791
with their four spiritual or ethereal counterparts.

1182
01:22:58.241 --> 01:23:01.101
The octagon is also prevalent throughout the art

1183
01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:04.251
and architecture of esoteric Islam.

1184
01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:07.281
Particularly its temples as well as temples

1185
01:23:07.281 --> 01:23:09.331
belonging to Eastern faiths.

1186
01:23:40.501 --> 01:23:42.541
The final figure in sacred geometry

1187
01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:44.691
is the nine-sided nonagon.

1188
01:23:46.041 --> 01:23:47.801
This is the free fold expression

1189
01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:49.921
of the trinity and so it invokes

1190
01:23:49.921 --> 01:23:52.411
the properties of highest achievement.

1191
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:57.551
Completion, utmost expression, and perfection.

1192
01:23:59.221 --> 01:24:02.711
Such qualities are expressed in everyday phrases.

1193
01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:06.991
For example to be madly in love is to be on cloud nine.

1194
01:24:07.881 --> 01:24:11.501
To do you very best is to go the whole nine yards,

1195
01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:14.901
Even the very act of creative perfection

1196
01:24:14.901 --> 01:24:16.601
the human birth cycle,

1197
01:24:16.601 --> 01:24:19.031
is completed in nine months.

1198
01:24:21.241 --> 01:24:23.321
Working with a nonagon in your temple

1199
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:25.441
essentially brings you into connection

1200
01:24:25.441 --> 01:24:27.411
with all there is.

1201
01:24:29.881 --> 01:24:32.941
This concept is seen in the Egyptian Aenead

1202
01:24:32.941 --> 01:24:36.441
who's nine gods, or netta, each represent

1203
01:24:36.441 --> 01:24:40.251
an archetypal principle governing the cause of nature.

1204
01:25:11.281 --> 01:25:13.801
Now that we know the properties of each geometry,

1205
01:25:13.801 --> 01:25:16.001
we can consider which is the most relevant

1206
01:25:16.001 --> 01:25:18.391
to the purpose of our temple.

1207
01:25:20.861 --> 01:25:24.631
In this program, the primary aim is to bring in information.

1208
01:25:25.161 --> 01:25:27.081
And to give this information structure

1209
01:25:27.081 --> 01:25:30.941
so that we can apply it in a practical and methodical manner

1210
01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:34.651
such properties belong to the hexagon.

1211
01:25:35.461 --> 01:25:38.221
So arranging the stones in our temple in progress

1212
01:25:38.221 --> 01:25:40.421
according to the angles of the hexagon,

1213
01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:42.551
is the appropriate thing to do.

1214
01:25:47.501 --> 01:25:51.181
If like me, you agonized over geometry in school,

1215
01:25:51.181 --> 01:25:53.101
particularly because it was never taught

1216
01:25:53.101 --> 01:25:54.821
as colorfully as this,

1217
01:25:54.821 --> 01:25:56.701
here is a simple method of constructing

1218
01:25:56.701 --> 01:25:58.431
any geometric shape.

1219
01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:02.651
Take a circle...

1220
01:26:03.901 --> 01:26:07.741
and divide a circumference of 360 degrees

1221
01:26:07.741 --> 01:26:10.970
by the number of points in your geometry.

1222
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:15.880
In this case, 360 divided by six equals 60 degrees.

1223
01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.202
Next mark off six points at 60 degree intervals

1224
01:26:22.202 --> 01:26:25.012
from the center, and along the circumference.

1225
01:26:37.822 --> 01:26:39.592
Now connect the dots.

1226
01:26:53.282 --> 01:26:56.692
(ethereal beat)

1227
01:29:20.282 --> 01:29:22.422
Since many geometric figures can be drawn

1228
01:29:22.422 --> 01:29:24.562
in a multitude of ways,

1229
01:29:24.562 --> 01:29:26.742
you can position the stones of a temple

1230
01:29:26.742 --> 01:29:29.962
in a myriad of ways but always in relationship

1231
01:29:29.962 --> 01:29:32.092
to the underlying geometry.

1232
01:29:34.862 --> 01:29:37.582
The simplest method is to reference each of the points

1233
01:29:37.582 --> 01:29:39.532
along the circumference.

1234
01:29:42.562 --> 01:29:45.142
Because the angle between these points is unique

1235
01:29:45.142 --> 01:29:48.402
to the hexagon, each stone will hold the energy

1236
01:29:48.402 --> 01:29:50.272
of this geometry.

1237
01:29:51.722 --> 01:29:54.062
You can also choose to place the stones

1238
01:29:54.062 --> 01:29:55.722
on the six nodes,

1239
01:29:55.722 --> 01:29:59.772
that is the points where the construction lines intersect.

1240
01:30:02.742 --> 01:30:05.842
These stones are now set to be in harmonic proportion

1241
01:30:05.842 --> 01:30:08.512
to the stones along the circumference.

1242
01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:11.602
Or if you happen to have a lot of stones handy,

1243
01:30:11.602 --> 01:30:14.212
you can blatantly mark the entire geometry.

1244
01:30:15.842 --> 01:30:17.742
Here's another method,

1245
01:30:17.742 --> 01:30:20.382
connect all the nodes with the circle.

1246
01:30:20.382 --> 01:30:23.682
Any number of stones placed along this inner circle

1247
01:30:23.682 --> 01:30:26.322
will be in harmonic proportion to the stones along

1248
01:30:26.322 --> 01:30:28.072
the outer circle.

1249
01:30:29.062 --> 01:30:31.622
In this case, it is not necessary to anchor the points

1250
01:30:31.622 --> 01:30:35.582
of the geometry because its the area between the two circles

1251
01:30:35.582 --> 01:30:38.952
that is in proportion to the hexagonal geometry.

1252
01:30:40.162 --> 01:30:42.042
You can choose to add a third ring

1253
01:30:42.042 --> 01:30:44.632
that touches the inside of the hexagon.

1254
01:30:47.262 --> 01:30:48.482
In each case,

1255
01:30:48.482 --> 01:30:50.282
the harmonic proportion of the geometry

1256
01:30:50.282 --> 01:30:51.932
is maintained.

1257
01:30:54.142 --> 01:30:56.822
The energy of this geometry can even be anchored

1258
01:30:56.822 --> 01:31:00.022
by simply referencing each of the six unique points

1259
01:31:00.022 --> 01:31:02.752
without the need for a visual circumference.

1260
01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:07.452
Let us return to our temple.

1261
01:31:08.122 --> 01:31:10.912
We are now ready to ground the hexagonal geometry.

1262
01:31:12.682 --> 01:31:16.061
To emphasize the solar principles of structure and logic

1263
01:31:16.061 --> 01:31:19.041
in our temple, we choose volcanic stone,

1264
01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:22.741
granite, and basalt, each containing a high degree

1265
01:31:22.741 --> 01:31:24.371
of quartz.

1266
01:31:25.181 --> 01:31:28.181
And of course, one female sandstone to give motion

1267
01:31:28.181 --> 01:31:30.031
to the fixed male element.

1268
01:31:32.301 --> 01:31:34.661
Choosing the simplest expression of the hexagon

1269
01:31:34.661 --> 01:31:38.061
we place a stone at each of the points of the hexagon

1270
01:31:38.061 --> 01:31:39.851
that touch the circumference.

1271
01:31:49.941 --> 01:31:51.541
To emphasize the geometry,

1272
01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:53.941
and to make the temple more visually appealing,

1273
01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:56.751
we add a stone at each of the six nodes,

1274
01:31:59.901 --> 01:32:02.741
adding geometry does not in itself generate anything

1275
01:32:02.741 --> 01:32:06.151
until it is given conscious action,

1276
01:32:06.741 --> 01:32:10.281
it is nothing more than a bunch of lines on a landscape.

1277
01:32:11.701 --> 01:32:13.561
As we have learned,

1278
01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:16.021
you must give an object attention and intention

1279
01:32:16.021 --> 01:32:18.391
so that action can take place.

1280
01:32:21.301 --> 01:32:23.751
We are now ready to initiate the process.

1281
01:32:25.661 --> 01:32:27.531
Focus on these stones,

1282
01:32:28.641 --> 01:32:31.811
send your attention to bare on their alignment.

1283
01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:35.851
Recognize the construction lines of the hexagon.

1284
01:32:36.501 --> 01:32:40.791
Appreciate the points and nodes and the space in between.

1285
01:32:43.221 --> 01:32:47.141
As you hold these images, send the stones your intent

1286
01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:51.271
by stating out loud, by my conscious intent,

1287
01:32:51.861 --> 01:32:54.881
I ask that the rational qualities of this gemoetry

1288
01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:57.221
be represented within this temple

1289
01:32:57.221 --> 01:33:01.411
to give structure to my thought and my work.

1290
01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:03.900
For the purpose of learning.

1291
01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.340
For the highest good of the local spirit

1292
01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:08.690
and for the highest good of all.

1293
01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.380
Again choose words that are apprioriate

1294
01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:15.370
for your individual purpose.

1295
01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.010
It is done.

1296
01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.760
We can now remove the construction lines

1297
01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:26.350
leaving every stone to anchor the properties of the hexagon

1298
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.979
this geometry is now occult.

1299
01:33:29.979 --> 01:33:31.889
It is hidden from the eye.

1300
01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:38.879
For this demonstration, we also choose

1301
01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:41.259
to remove the original perimeter stones

1302
01:33:41.259 --> 01:33:44.719
leaving just the six outer and six inner stones

1303
01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.329
that mark the geometry.

1304
01:33:47.839 --> 01:33:50.479
Surprisingly this does not alter the energy field

1305
01:33:50.479 --> 01:33:52.799
previously established around the perimeter

1306
01:33:52.799 --> 01:33:54.659
of the temple.

1307
01:33:54.659 --> 01:33:56.619
Nor does it alter the location of the water

1308
01:33:56.619 --> 01:33:58.369
and magnetic lines.

1309
01:34:00.479 --> 01:34:03.579
This is because your intent is super physical

1310
01:34:03.579 --> 01:34:06.589
it supersedes everything in the physical world.

1311
01:34:07.859 --> 01:34:09.839
Your thoughts of anchoring the perimeter

1312
01:34:09.839 --> 01:34:13.139
are enough to create a living protective field

1313
01:34:13.139 --> 01:34:15.619
around the remaining stones.

1314
01:34:15.619 --> 01:34:18.369
That now hold the energy of the hexagon.

1315
01:34:20.379 --> 01:34:23.059
Of course any energy field is susceptible

1316
01:34:23.059 --> 01:34:25.319
to exterior influences.

1317
01:34:25.319 --> 01:34:27.119
So by removing the stones,

1318
01:34:27.119 --> 01:34:31.079
it means it is up to you to reinforce their original intent

1319
01:34:31.079 --> 01:34:33.329
and purpose on a regular basis.

1320
01:34:34.619 --> 01:34:37.179
Like plants, even energy needs nourishment

1321
01:34:37.179 --> 01:34:39.629
to stay healthy and purposeful.

1322
01:34:40.739 --> 01:34:43.119
And your regular attention and intention

1323
01:34:43.119 --> 01:34:45.509
is all that is required.

1324
01:34:46.819 --> 01:34:49.419
So if you're someone who leads a busy lifestyle,

1325
01:34:49.419 --> 01:34:51.879
and is inclined to forget to water the plants,

1326
01:34:51.879 --> 01:34:54.719
you may want to leave the original perimeter stones,

1327
01:34:54.719 --> 01:34:56.779
since they retain the memory of the purpose

1328
01:34:56.779 --> 01:34:58.409
you gave them.

1329
01:34:59.599 --> 01:35:01.559
But conscious activation of the geometry

1330
01:35:01.559 --> 01:35:03.929
turns it into bio-geometry.

1331
01:35:04.659 --> 01:35:06.879
And this starts to influence the atoms of energy

1332
01:35:06.879 --> 01:35:08.549
inside a temple.

1333
01:35:09.439 --> 01:35:11.519
You should find that the inner spiral will have

1334
01:35:11.519 --> 01:35:13.389
increasing spin.

1335
01:35:14.539 --> 01:35:17.339
Outside the perimeter, a stronger flow of ripples

1336
01:35:17.339 --> 01:35:19.429
can also be felt and measured.

1337
01:35:28.739 --> 01:35:30.799
Once you gain confidence with geometry,

1338
01:35:30.799 --> 01:35:33.309
you'll wish to play with more complex structures.

1339
01:35:35.259 --> 01:35:38.719
Lets say you are creating a feature in a garden,

1340
01:35:38.719 --> 01:35:41.099
you can multiply the effects of the root geometry

1341
01:35:41.099 --> 01:35:43.909
by expanding it outward three times.

1342
01:35:44.959 --> 01:35:47.729
Such a technique is called nesting.

1343
01:35:49.459 --> 01:35:52.439
In this example, we have three nested hexagons,

1344
01:35:52.439 --> 01:35:55.609
each growing from where the other completes.

1345
01:35:56.579 --> 01:35:58.779
Linking all the nodes with circles,

1346
01:35:58.779 --> 01:36:00.879
and removing the geometry, the effect

1347
01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:02.889
can be visually dramatic.

1348
01:36:03.539 --> 01:36:07.149
It looks as if you are actually looking down into a vortex.

1349
01:36:11.079 --> 01:36:14.739
Because one temple can be used for multiple purposes,

1350
01:36:14.739 --> 01:36:18.289
multiple geometries can be encoded within the same perimeter

1351
01:36:19.099 --> 01:36:22.829
one of the best examples of this practice is stone hedge.

1352
01:36:23.659 --> 01:36:25.719
Each of the rings and horseshoes of stones

1353
01:36:25.719 --> 01:36:28.039
were designed to be activated according to the

1354
01:36:28.039 --> 01:36:30.249
intended use of the day.

1355
01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:34.839
So when female or creative rights were performed,

1356
01:36:34.839 --> 01:36:37.219
only those stones aligned to the pentragram

1357
01:36:37.219 --> 01:36:39.039
were brought to life.

1358
01:36:39.039 --> 01:36:42.799
During solar or warrior rituals,

1359
01:36:42.799 --> 01:36:45.239
only the stones relating to the hexagon

1360
01:36:45.239 --> 01:36:46.929
were activated.

1361
01:36:48.079 --> 01:36:50.259
But when sound ceremonies were performed,

1362
01:36:50.259 --> 01:36:53.539
the entire temple was used because the whole temple

1363
01:36:53.539 --> 01:36:55.789
is held within a heptagon.

1364
01:36:58.079 --> 01:36:59.419
The key thing to remember,

1365
01:36:59.419 --> 01:37:01.039
is that the only parts of the temple

1366
01:37:01.039 --> 01:37:03.079
that are activated at any moment,

1367
01:37:03.079 --> 01:37:05.199
are those parts you consciously invoke

1368
01:37:05.199 --> 01:37:08.349
using your attention and intention.

1369
01:37:09.619 --> 01:37:12.349
Otherwise they are just ordinary stones.

1370
01:37:13.299 --> 01:37:15.290
All be it, big ones.

1371
01:37:18.959 --> 01:37:22.409
Let me show you an example of encoding two geometries.

1372
01:37:23.179 --> 01:37:26.229
Take the inner core of a pentagram, the pentagon.

1373
01:37:27.199 --> 01:37:31.309
Now inscribe two circles the first touching the inside.

1374
01:37:32.019 --> 01:37:34.089
The second the outer points.

1375
01:37:36.219 --> 01:37:38.519
Any stones placed along these circles

1376
01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:41.269
are in proportional harmony to each other.

1377
01:37:44.199 --> 01:37:47.889
Next design a hexagon inside that innercircle,

1378
01:37:49.539 --> 01:37:52.038
remove the inner stones,

1379
01:37:52.038 --> 01:37:55.048
and anchor a stone at each point of the hexagon.

1380
01:37:57.958 --> 01:37:59.858
When you rub out the geometry,

1381
01:37:59.858 --> 01:38:03.868
you now have a dual geometry male and female temple.

1382
01:38:05.798 --> 01:38:08.588
A similar technique is used by nature.

1383
01:38:09.278 --> 01:38:12.058
Every wondered why the inside of the six pointed daffodil

1384
01:38:12.058 --> 01:38:14.038
is called a bell?

1385
01:38:14.038 --> 01:38:16.668
Just add a heptagon and you'll find out.

1386
01:38:20.058 --> 01:38:22.278
Here is an example of a temple that incorporates

1387
01:38:22.278 --> 01:38:25.178
three geometries, each cunningly concealed

1388
01:38:25.178 --> 01:38:28.768
within what looks like a innocent six-petaled flower.

1389
01:38:30.038 --> 01:38:31.958
I created this temple in my garden

1390
01:38:31.958 --> 01:38:34.488
using chips of granite topped with marble.

1391
01:38:36.258 --> 01:38:38.798
The design is based on a genuine crop circle

1392
01:38:38.798 --> 01:38:40.658
with whom I had an interesting experience

1393
01:38:40.658 --> 01:38:42.628
to say the least.

1394
01:38:43.758 --> 01:38:45.638
If you look carefully, you will see just how

1395
01:38:45.638 --> 01:38:49.108
the harmonics of the pentagram, the hexagon,

1396
01:38:49.108 --> 01:38:52.128
and the heptagon, each reference various elements

1397
01:38:52.128 --> 01:38:53.678
of the design.

1398
01:38:57.558 --> 01:39:00.636
And yet as far as any of my less than understanding

1399
01:39:00.636 --> 01:39:03.176
neighbors were concerned, this is nothing more

1400
01:39:03.176 --> 01:39:06.566
than a harmless flower design in the middle of a grass lawn.

1401
01:39:30.714 --> 01:39:33.294
At this point in our temple building process,

1402
01:39:33.294 --> 01:39:36.694
we have applied and accumulated several principles

1403
01:39:36.694 --> 01:39:39.924
which have served to stir a portal into motion.

1404
01:39:41.154 --> 01:39:44.194
All we need now is to vector the terrestrial energy

1405
01:39:44.194 --> 01:39:46.054
building up around the perimeter,

1406
01:39:46.054 --> 01:39:47.904
to enter the temple.

1407
01:39:48.674 --> 01:39:51.264
And to do this, we must give it an entrance.

1408
01:39:54.854 --> 01:39:58.764
Which brings us to the sixth principle of temple making.

1409
01:40:35.514 --> 01:40:38.154
Every temple has a gateway,

1410
01:40:38.154 --> 01:40:41.884
even if its not immediately apparent.

1411
01:40:53.034 --> 01:40:55.414
the origin of the word gate comes from the latin

1412
01:40:55.414 --> 01:40:59.504
porta from which we get our modern term portal.

1413
01:41:00.774 --> 01:41:02.854
Rather appropriate then given the history

1414
01:41:02.854 --> 01:41:06.084
of healing and invocation at the sacred sites.

1415
01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:10.674
And particularly so if you consider the gate or doorway

1416
01:41:10.674 --> 01:41:13.854
of a temple serves as a conduit for the pathways

1417
01:41:13.854 --> 01:41:17.004
of living magnetic energy to enter the site.

1418
01:41:20.214 --> 01:41:22.814
So when you cross the threshold of a temple,

1419
01:41:22.814 --> 01:41:25.804
you are literally entering a portal.

1420
01:41:30.394 --> 01:41:32.034
With the advent of churches,

1421
01:41:32.034 --> 01:41:34.694
these doorways into other worlds became known as

1422
01:41:34.694 --> 01:41:38.454
entrances because within their womb,

1423
01:41:38.454 --> 01:41:42.084
they entrance you into a new level of awareness.

1424
01:41:43.934 --> 01:41:46.774
Needless to say, that the purposeful orientation

1425
01:41:46.774 --> 01:41:49.974
of a temple's doorway, is as important as any principle

1426
01:41:49.974 --> 01:41:51.644
taught so far.

1427
01:41:52.434 --> 01:41:55.014
Because it serves to draw and focus vital forces

1428
01:41:55.014 --> 01:41:57.184
into a designated space.

1429
01:41:59.954 --> 01:42:02.614
Just like your attention and intention,

1430
01:42:02.614 --> 01:42:05.114
when earth energy is consciously directed

1431
01:42:05.114 --> 01:42:07.704
it can be used constructively.

1432
01:42:12.914 --> 01:42:15.034
Indigenous cultures throughout the world

1433
01:42:15.034 --> 01:42:17.794
have maintained the tradition of aligning their temples

1434
01:42:17.794 --> 01:42:21.394
either by referencing the four fixed cardinal directions,

1435
01:42:21.394 --> 01:42:25.624
by complex orientation to specific stars,

1436
01:42:26.774 --> 01:42:30.044
or by marking the points of the solstice and equinox.

1437
01:42:31.634 --> 01:42:34.434
Vestiges of this practice were carried into the symbols

1438
01:42:34.434 --> 01:42:37.164
of Hinduism and Celtic tradition.

1439
01:42:37.794 --> 01:42:40.204
And later adopted by Christianity.

1440
01:42:45.174 --> 01:42:47.354
Just as the choice of stone and geometry

1441
01:42:47.354 --> 01:42:49.894
were important considerations when constructing

1442
01:42:49.894 --> 01:42:54.074
the temple, the choice of orientation added one final layer

1443
01:42:54.074 --> 01:42:58.084
of possibility to the site and its intended purpose.

1444
01:43:00.214 --> 01:43:01.754
In the ancient world,

1445
01:43:01.754 --> 01:43:05.204
every element was seen as imbued with consciousness.

1446
01:43:06.074 --> 01:43:08.274
Therefore the orientation of the temple

1447
01:43:08.274 --> 01:43:10.234
to the various compass points

1448
01:43:10.234 --> 01:43:13.254
not only invoked a specific quality of energy,

1449
01:43:13.254 --> 01:43:16.964
it also served to magnify the information received.

1450
01:43:22.434 --> 01:43:25.654
Giving these invisible energies a physical form,

1451
01:43:25.654 --> 01:43:28.184
helps people focus their attention.

1452
01:43:28.894 --> 01:43:32.114
And so a god or angel was attributed to each

1453
01:43:32.114 --> 01:43:35.114
cardinal direction and each one represented

1454
01:43:35.114 --> 01:43:37.564
a type of life force.

1455
01:43:38.374 --> 01:43:41.254
This is why it is important to honor the local deity,

1456
01:43:41.254 --> 01:43:44.614
angel, or diva not for worship,

1457
01:43:44.614 --> 01:43:47.844
but as a recognition of a spirit of place.

1458
01:43:55.254 --> 01:43:57.754
So let's take a look at the temple alignments

1459
01:43:57.754 --> 01:44:00.084
and see what each one invokes.

1460
01:44:09.054 --> 01:44:11.014
Positioning your entrance in the north

1461
01:44:11.014 --> 01:44:14.794
is to face the cold and hardness of the north pole.

1462
01:44:15.794 --> 01:44:18.944
And thus it connects with the element of earth.

1463
01:44:20.154 --> 01:44:23.014
Such a temple invokes the properties of matter

1464
01:44:23.014 --> 01:44:26.714
and magnetism and as such, connects with those material

1465
01:44:26.714 --> 01:44:29.464
and magnetic beings called humans.

1466
01:44:31.394 --> 01:44:33.394
The qualities of north are entrusted

1467
01:44:33.394 --> 01:44:35.504
to the archangel Uriel.

1468
01:44:38.114 --> 01:44:42.033
An example of northern orientation are the pyramids of Giza.

1469
01:44:42.033 --> 01:44:44.653
Which ultimately worked with magnetism

1470
01:44:44.653 --> 01:44:47.113
and the material forces of the earth,

1471
01:44:47.113 --> 01:44:50.973
and served dead and now as a place of initiation

1472
01:44:50.973 --> 01:44:53.583
and transformation for many people.

1473
01:45:07.933 --> 01:45:11.452
An entrance in the south faces the equator,

1474
01:45:11.452 --> 01:45:14.022
and draws the element of fire.

1475
01:45:15.132 --> 01:45:17.432
It associates with the properties of light,

1476
01:45:17.432 --> 01:45:22.262
strength, power, protection,

1477
01:45:23.412 --> 01:45:25.582
and the spiritual warrior.

1478
01:45:27.032 --> 01:45:31.002
Such qualities are entrusted to the archangel Michael.

1479
01:45:33.832 --> 01:45:37.542
An example of sudden orientation is the mangificant temple

1480
01:45:37.542 --> 01:45:41.992
of Edfu, it is also an example of how these principles

1481
01:45:41.992 --> 01:45:44.922
can be used for personal power.

1482
01:45:46.052 --> 01:45:48.972
The Pharaoh Rameses the second used such a temple

1483
01:45:48.972 --> 01:45:52.582
to magnify his own ego and merge his strength.

1484
01:45:56.292 --> 01:45:58.532
Another big example is the hall of prayer,

1485
01:45:58.532 --> 01:46:01.482
housed within the temple of heaven in Beijing.

1486
01:46:02.132 --> 01:46:04.532
Without a doubt, a seat of unbridled solar power

1487
01:46:04.532 --> 01:46:06.422
for many centuries.

1488
01:46:19.572 --> 01:46:23.252
An eastern entrance draws the element of air.

1489
01:46:24.942 --> 01:46:27.432
Since this direction generally faces the light

1490
01:46:27.432 --> 01:46:29.372
of the reborn sun,

1491
01:46:29.372 --> 01:46:32.612
such temples invoke the properties of awakening,

1492
01:46:32.612 --> 01:46:34.181
and healing,

1493
01:46:35.851 --> 01:46:37.971
and since you are figuratively associating

1494
01:46:37.971 --> 01:46:40.791
with the light emerging out of darkness,

1495
01:46:40.791 --> 01:46:43.401
you are invoking understanding.

1496
01:46:44.891 --> 01:46:48.861
These qualities are entrusted to the archangel Rafael.

1497
01:46:50.711 --> 01:46:53.571
Many Native American sweat lodges are still aligned

1498
01:46:53.571 --> 01:46:56.061
to this day to the east.

1499
01:47:11.871 --> 01:47:15.441
The western entrance connects with the element of water.

1500
01:47:15.951 --> 01:47:19.101
And faces the path of the setting or dying sun.

1501
01:47:21.311 --> 01:47:23.791
As a symbol of descending such temples

1502
01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:26.581
are associated with traveling within.

1503
01:47:27.591 --> 01:47:30.421
With communication and the underworld,

1504
01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:35.481
these forces are entrusted with the archangel Gabriel.

1505
01:47:36.331 --> 01:47:38.311
Traditionally seen in the western world

1506
01:47:38.311 --> 01:47:41.031
as the one who brings communication and messages

1507
01:47:41.031 --> 01:47:43.641
from the realm of god to humanity.

1508
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:03.009
These then are the four material or fixed

1509
01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:04.719
temple alignments.

1510
01:48:07.309 --> 01:48:09.749
But as far as the temple builders were concerned,

1511
01:48:09.749 --> 01:48:13.348
the cross points in between were the most dynamic.

1512
01:48:13.348 --> 01:48:16.028
Because they reflect that transitional moment,

1513
01:48:16.028 --> 01:48:18.498
between one form and another.

1514
01:48:20.908 --> 01:48:22.988
Much like the points of the equinox,

1515
01:48:22.988 --> 01:48:26.478
when the forces of light and dark are in optimum balance.

1516
01:48:27.268 --> 01:48:29.398
Hence the origin of that word.

1517
01:48:31.008 --> 01:48:34.048
These cross-quarters were considered to be ethereal

1518
01:48:34.048 --> 01:48:37.778
and so they were given no physical face or angel.

1519
01:48:38.329 --> 01:48:42.108
They were a mystery, occult, unseen,

1520
01:48:46.148 --> 01:48:48.128
the great number of surviving temples

1521
01:48:48.128 --> 01:48:50.368
throughout Europe faced the south-east

1522
01:48:50.368 --> 01:48:52.448
because they were built during an era

1523
01:48:52.448 --> 01:48:54.328
when crops were failing due to

1524
01:48:54.328 --> 01:48:57.018
extraordinary ecological disasters.

1525
01:48:58.368 --> 01:49:00.548
And so they did what they could to amplify

1526
01:49:00.548 --> 01:49:03.058
the fertilizing power of the sun.

1527
01:49:04.308 --> 01:49:07.488
Such entrances were oriented to the south-east,

1528
01:49:07.488 --> 01:49:10.128
toward the rising winter sun when light

1529
01:49:10.128 --> 01:49:12.978
was at its most distant and weakest.

1530
01:49:14.168 --> 01:49:16.388
This light would be guided into the temple

1531
01:49:16.388 --> 01:49:18.328
to increasing virtue.

1532
01:49:18.328 --> 01:49:21.818
And with it, the fertility of the land and its people.

1533
01:49:24.168 --> 01:49:27.278
Thus the south-east orientation is associated

1534
01:49:27.278 --> 01:49:32.158
with fertility and birthing, literally and metaphorically.

1535
01:49:34.128 --> 01:49:38.018
It also vectors the properties of growth and creativity.

1536
01:49:39.748 --> 01:49:42.998
So its fertility of mind as well as body.

1537
01:49:44.748 --> 01:49:47.438
One example is the temple of Hapshepshod.

1538
01:49:47.467 --> 01:49:50.057
Where birthing ceremonies were once conducted.

1539
01:49:50.867 --> 01:49:53.937
As well as instruction on the art of sacred sexuality.

1540
01:50:13.927 --> 01:50:15.987
Temples aligned to the south-west

1541
01:50:15.987 --> 01:50:18.817
are places of honoring and gratitude.

1542
01:50:19.327 --> 01:50:21.287
Of giving thanks to the forces that made

1543
01:50:21.287 --> 01:50:23.147
the bounty of the earth possible

1544
01:50:23.147 --> 01:50:25.447
as well as the manifestation of plenty

1545
01:50:25.447 --> 01:50:27.437
in one's personal life.

1546
01:50:28.847 --> 01:50:31.287
This orientation represents the triumph of light

1547
01:50:31.287 --> 01:50:33.917
materially and metaphorically.

1548
01:50:35.747 --> 01:50:38.517
Traditionally these are harvest temples.

1549
01:50:39.067 --> 01:50:41.147
They are places associated with celebration

1550
01:50:41.147 --> 01:50:44.897
and festivity, and with a Celtic feast of Lammice.

1551
01:50:46.847 --> 01:50:49.447
The Kiva at bandolier in New Mexico,

1552
01:50:49.447 --> 01:50:52.767
is an example of a place of honoring and harvest.

1553
01:50:52.767 --> 01:50:56.397
With its entrance located in the south-west.

1554
01:51:10.327 --> 01:51:12.247
And entrance facing the north-west

1555
01:51:12.247 --> 01:51:15.147
is oriented to the darkest time of the year,

1556
01:51:15.147 --> 01:51:18.817
when the veil with other dimensions is particularly thin.

1557
01:51:21.607 --> 01:51:24.327
Such temples are intense spiritual places

1558
01:51:24.327 --> 01:51:27.107
because they are used to remember and pay tribute

1559
01:51:27.107 --> 01:51:29.727
to the spirit world, so that people may be offered

1560
01:51:29.727 --> 01:51:32.867
safe passage through the dark days of winter.

1561
01:51:32.867 --> 01:51:35.877
To re-emerge safely into the light of spring.

1562
01:51:37.087 --> 01:51:40.507
Such temples are often associated with all hallows eve.

1563
01:51:40.507 --> 01:51:43.077
Or Halloween as we call it today.

1564
01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:45.267
And if you happen to be Celtic,

1565
01:51:45.267 --> 01:51:47.637
this would be the Celtic feast of Sauen.

1566
01:51:49.687 --> 01:51:51.647
Northwestern temples therefore favor

1567
01:51:51.647 --> 01:51:56.106
the properties of introspection and a return to the womb.

1568
01:52:08.236 --> 01:52:10.266
Last and certainly not least,

1569
01:52:10.266 --> 01:52:12.146
was the north-eastern alignment

1570
01:52:12.146 --> 01:52:15.456
which faces the rising mid summer solstice sun.

1571
01:52:16.966 --> 01:52:19.746
To orient your temple to this is to draw to you

1572
01:52:19.746 --> 01:52:23.406
the wisdom of the ancestors, since the light emerges

1573
01:52:23.406 --> 01:52:26.325
at its most exalted heavenly position.

1574
01:52:26.325 --> 01:52:29.475
So symbolically, it is associated with enlightenment.

1575
01:52:31.485 --> 01:52:34.585
Not only do temples associate with ancestral wisdom

1576
01:52:34.585 --> 01:52:36.265
face north-east.

1577
01:52:36.265 --> 01:52:39.335
They are also the oldest monuments on earth.

1578
01:52:40.825 --> 01:52:43.955
The stone rose of Carmac in Northern France.

1579
01:52:45.545 --> 01:52:47.585
The neolithic foundations upon which

1580
01:52:47.585 --> 01:52:49.635
Shattal Cathedral stands.

1581
01:52:50.822 --> 01:52:53.903
The original Navajo sacred site at Shi Mi oh,

1582
01:52:53.903 --> 01:52:58.121
in New Mexicno, and of course Stone Hedge.

1583
01:52:58.121 --> 01:52:59.831
Just to name a few.

1584
01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:08.441
Just as a temple can be built with multiple geometries

1585
01:53:08.441 --> 01:53:11.019
to fulfill a multitude of uses.

1586
01:53:11.019 --> 01:53:13.708
So it can have multiple entrances.

1587
01:53:14.959 --> 01:53:17.818
In northern Britain, the stone circle of Swinside

1588
01:53:17.818 --> 01:53:21.529
is used as a place of fertility as well as harvest.

1589
01:53:22.239 --> 01:53:24.119
And so it has two entrances.

1590
01:53:24.119 --> 01:53:26.599
One oriented to the southeast,

1591
01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:29.209
the other to the southwest.

1592
01:53:31.259 --> 01:53:33.199
Likewise, Ave Briestone circle,

1593
01:53:33.199 --> 01:53:35.619
a lunar fertility temple, has its

1594
01:53:35.619 --> 01:53:37.498
principle processional entrance

1595
01:53:37.498 --> 01:53:39.878
in the southeast and the second

1596
01:53:39.878 --> 01:53:42.257
processional route in the southwest.

1597
01:53:42.257 --> 01:53:44.958
Which was used in times of tribute and thanksgiving

1598
01:53:44.958 --> 01:53:46.448
to the light.

1599
01:53:47.957 --> 01:53:51.158
The principle of dual orientation was incorporated

1600
01:53:51.158 --> 01:53:53.718
into Celtic places of worship.

1601
01:53:53.718 --> 01:53:57.868
And subsequently found its way into latter day churches.

1602
01:53:59.017 --> 01:54:01.757
In orientating their names east to west,

1603
01:54:01.757 --> 01:54:04.438
they are following the processional path of the rising

1604
01:54:04.438 --> 01:54:05.987
and setting sun.

1605
01:54:06.458 --> 01:54:08.888
A profoundly pagan ritual.

1606
01:54:09.718 --> 01:54:11.998
To this day, you can still see the pagan past

1607
01:54:11.998 --> 01:54:13.787
at work in churches.

1608
01:54:14.877 --> 01:54:16.858
To receive the newborn light,

1609
01:54:16.858 --> 01:54:19.458
battisons are conducted in the east

1610
01:54:19.458 --> 01:54:22.117
and to communicate with the underworld

1611
01:54:22.117 --> 01:54:24.928
funerals enter through the west.

1612
01:54:26.578 --> 01:54:29.017
In times past, even enlightened pharaohs,

1613
01:54:29.017 --> 01:54:31.958
kings and queens, were buried with their head

1614
01:54:31.958 --> 01:54:36.008
in the east so that the soul may seek understanding.

1615
01:54:40.228 --> 01:54:44.938
At the temple of Luxel, the entrances face northeast

1616
01:54:44.938 --> 01:54:48.637
and southwest, making it a place of ancestral wisdom

1617
01:54:48.637 --> 01:54:51.308
as well as tribute to manifestation.

1618
01:54:53.078 --> 01:54:55.251
This ceremonial root what to they would considered

1619
01:54:55.251 --> 01:54:59.070
the nave in a church fulfills a third function.

1620
01:54:59.070 --> 01:55:02.431
In that it is aligned 26 degrees north east,

1621
01:55:02.431 --> 01:55:05.191
and marks the hierarchical rising of Sirius

1622
01:55:05.191 --> 01:55:09.280
the star most associated with ancestral wisdom.

1623
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:14.931
Surrounded by the Capuchin of a bustling

1624
01:55:14.931 --> 01:55:16.490
Parisonal metropolis,

1625
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:19.110
sits this garden that key on its shell.

1626
01:55:19.110 --> 01:55:21.916
An urban oasis for reflection.

1627
01:55:23.067 --> 01:55:24.606
This inner city temple,

1628
01:55:24.606 --> 01:55:27.147
with its association with the archangel Michael,

1629
01:55:27.147 --> 01:55:30.077
combines man principles of temple making.

1630
01:55:31.787 --> 01:55:35.557
Its four entrances each reference the fixed cardinal points.

1631
01:55:36.647 --> 01:55:38.666
At the center, lies the water element

1632
01:55:38.666 --> 01:55:40.657
in the shape of a fountain.

1633
01:55:41.847 --> 01:55:44.617
It is bordered within octagonal geometry.

1634
01:55:45.627 --> 01:55:47.207
And the relationship of its elements

1635
01:55:47.207 --> 01:55:50.217
conceals the harmonics of the pentagram.

1636
01:55:56.827 --> 01:55:59.786
Now that we have some understanding of orientation,

1637
01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.957
its applied to our temple.

1638
01:56:03.866 --> 01:56:06.167
When this siting of the most appropriate direction

1639
01:56:06.167 --> 01:56:07.807
for the entrance,

1640
01:56:07.807 --> 01:56:10.666
think carefully about the qualities you wishes to invoke

1641
01:56:10.666 --> 01:56:12.346
in your temple.

1642
01:56:12.346 --> 01:56:16.227
In this situation, we have been working with knowledge

1643
01:56:16.227 --> 01:56:19.887
and structure, and we want to bring understanding

1644
01:56:19.887 --> 01:56:22.637
to bear on all of this information.

1645
01:56:23.827 --> 01:56:26.207
So creating an entrance facing east

1646
01:56:26.207 --> 01:56:28.357
is the appropriate choice here.

1647
01:56:32.106 --> 01:56:35.207
After finding the orientation on a compass,

1648
01:56:35.207 --> 01:56:37.767
take a few stones, and mark a doorway,

1649
01:56:37.767 --> 01:56:40.716
on the perimeter of the temple.

1650
01:57:15.846 --> 01:57:18.247
Of course these stones will remain symbolic

1651
01:57:18.247 --> 01:57:21.177
until you come to apply the law of attraction.

1652
01:57:22.167 --> 01:57:24.096
So let's do that.

1653
01:57:25.266 --> 01:57:27.497
Send your attention to the stone.

1654
01:57:29.166 --> 01:57:31.277
Hold their shape in your mind.

1655
01:57:31.947 --> 01:57:33.937
Feel their weight.

1656
01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:38.217
Their surface texture, their position in the east.

1657
01:57:40.226 --> 01:57:42.846
And as you hold these images in your mind,

1658
01:57:42.846 --> 01:57:46.117
send out your intent to the stones,

1659
01:57:47.026 --> 01:57:50.396
and say out loud by my conscious intent

1660
01:57:51.207 --> 01:57:53.426
I ask that these stones be the conduit

1661
01:57:53.426 --> 01:57:57.156
of magnetic energy and life force into this space.

1662
01:57:58.487 --> 01:58:01.037
For the purpose of creating a temple of light.

1663
01:58:02.267 --> 01:58:04.327
For the highest good of the local spirit

1664
01:58:04.327 --> 01:58:06.477
and for the highest good of all.

1665
01:58:09.807 --> 01:58:11.356
It is done.

1666
01:58:16.006 --> 01:58:19.067
You will find that terrestrial energy is now streaming

1667
01:58:19.067 --> 01:58:21.687
into the space through the entrance created

1668
01:58:21.687 --> 01:58:23.937
by the placement of these stones.

1669
01:58:25.926 --> 01:58:27.447
If you measure the environment

1670
01:58:27.447 --> 01:58:30.447
inside the temple at the stage with dousing,

1671
01:58:30.447 --> 01:58:32.966
you will find that the spinning motion of energy

1672
01:58:32.966 --> 01:58:35.247
has been amplified significantly.

1673
01:58:38.717 --> 01:58:40.787
As with geometry,

1674
01:58:40.787 --> 01:58:43.577
there are many forms your entrance can take.

1675
01:58:44.627 --> 01:58:46.266
In this case, we have designed a

1676
01:58:46.266 --> 01:58:48.577
classic mirror handle entrance.

1677
01:58:49.347 --> 01:58:52.217
So called because it resembles the handle of a mirror.

1678
01:58:53.427 --> 01:58:56.187
The design is derived from the processional avenue

1679
01:58:56.187 --> 01:58:57.736
at Stone hedge.

1680
01:58:59.347 --> 01:59:01.626
But there are a myriad of solutions.

1681
01:59:01.626 --> 01:59:03.907
Especially if you plan to create your temple

1682
01:59:03.907 --> 01:59:06.337
within a limited physical environment.

1683
01:59:07.827 --> 01:59:10.327
You can place two stones in between the others

1684
01:59:10.327 --> 01:59:11.986
along the circumference.

1685
01:59:11.986 --> 01:59:14.916
if you do not want to disturb the original geometry.

1686
01:59:15.966 --> 01:59:18.486
Choose two stones to act as the entrance.

1687
01:59:18.486 --> 01:59:21.546
But try to make them stand out from the rest,

1688
01:59:21.546 --> 01:59:24.875
by making them bigger or different in color.

1689
01:59:28.046 --> 01:59:30.886
The second technique is to remove one stone,

1690
01:59:30.886 --> 01:59:33.745
marking the geometry along the circumference.

1691
01:59:33.745 --> 01:59:36.006
And place the entry stones relative

1692
01:59:36.006 --> 01:59:38.655
to the construction lines of the geometry.

1693
01:59:40.086 --> 01:59:41.786
This creates a pleasing doorway

1694
01:59:41.786 --> 01:59:43.405
while maintaining the integrity

1695
01:59:43.405 --> 01:59:45.256
of the underlying geometry.

1696
01:59:47.305 --> 01:59:50.385
If your temple is to be used for multiple purposes,

1697
01:59:50.385 --> 01:59:52.566
do as the garden temple in Paris,

1698
01:59:52.566 --> 01:59:56.466
create many entrances and use the law of attraction

1699
01:59:56.466 --> 02:00:00.756
to draw energy into each specific entrance as required.

1700
02:00:02.046 --> 02:00:05.386
Remember until you apply attention and intention,

1701
02:00:05.386 --> 02:00:08.906
these are just rocks and spaces in the circumference

1702
02:00:08.906 --> 02:00:10.595
nothing more.

1703
02:00:12.026 --> 02:00:14.966
If you're uncertain as to which alignment to choose,

1704
02:00:14.966 --> 02:00:17.166
simply create the door metaphysically

1705
02:00:17.166 --> 02:00:18.936
using your intent.

1706
02:00:20.346 --> 02:00:23.246
Once again your intent is super physical

1707
02:00:23.246 --> 02:00:26.166
therefore by thinking it and believing it,

1708
02:00:26.166 --> 02:00:28.276
you create it in reality.

1709
02:00:29.386 --> 02:00:31.695
Even if its not visible reality.

1710
02:00:33.345 --> 02:00:35.685
So in your physical circular temple,

1711
02:00:35.685 --> 02:00:37.866
you would walk through an invisible entrance

1712
02:00:37.866 --> 02:00:40.155
made of imaginary stones.

1713
02:00:41.186 --> 02:00:43.226
And if you believe strongly enough,

1714
02:00:43.226 --> 02:00:45.396
the effect will be the same.

1715
02:00:47.026 --> 02:00:50.596
But just be sure to walk in the right compass direction.

1716
02:00:51.385 --> 02:00:54.696
If you imagine east, don't walk in through the north.

1717
02:00:57.785 --> 02:01:00.106
We are almost ready to enter the temple

1718
02:01:00.106 --> 02:01:04.006
and experience its full potential, but before we do.

1719
02:01:04.006 --> 02:01:07.376
There's one final ingredient we have to add.

1720
02:01:08.326 --> 02:01:10.405
Which brings us to the seventh principle

1721
02:01:10.405 --> 02:01:12.276
of temple making.

1722
02:01:35.746 --> 02:01:39.546
(ethereal chants)

1723
02:01:39.546 --> 02:01:41.766
We have now completed the temple.

1724
02:01:44.626 --> 02:01:48.256
We drew in water and magnetism.

1725
02:01:49.646 --> 02:01:52.116
We applied sacred measure and stone.

1726
02:01:57.046 --> 02:01:58.676
Geometry...

1727
02:02:02.726 --> 02:02:05.735
and finally gave the temple orientation.

1728
02:02:07.046 --> 02:02:08.846
And the more tools we applied,

1729
02:02:08.846 --> 02:02:11.596
the greater the concentration of energy generated.

1730
02:02:15.926 --> 02:02:19.315
On their own, these processes do not a temple make.

1731
02:02:20.546 --> 02:02:22.685
A temple is a combination of elements

1732
02:02:22.685 --> 02:02:25.426
working synergistically and set into motion

1733
02:02:25.426 --> 02:02:27.475
as one whole element.

1734
02:02:28.586 --> 02:02:31.165
So we must add a final ingredient,

1735
02:02:31.165 --> 02:02:33.856
something that binds everything together.

1736
02:02:34.606 --> 02:02:37.756
In other words, the temple needs to be made holy.

1737
02:02:38.886 --> 02:02:40.926
And the most powerful gelling agent,

1738
02:02:40.926 --> 02:02:43.036
is focused intent.

1739
02:02:44.146 --> 02:02:46.086
And we now applied to all the elements

1740
02:02:46.086 --> 02:02:48.115
and treat them as one.

1741
02:02:50.846 --> 02:02:52.605
And the moment we apply it,

1742
02:02:52.605 --> 02:02:54.806
the energy building in and around the temple,

1743
02:02:54.806 --> 02:02:56.736
is given motion.

1744
02:02:58.445 --> 02:03:00.745
So using the law of attraction,

1745
02:03:00.745 --> 02:03:03.406
send your attention to the water,

1746
02:03:03.406 --> 02:03:07.636
the magnetic lines, the stones,

1747
02:03:08.646 --> 02:03:11.776
the measure, the geometry,

1748
02:03:12.825 --> 02:03:14.595
and the entrance.

1749
02:03:15.886 --> 02:03:17.886
Now hold them in your mind

1750
02:03:17.886 --> 02:03:19.756
as one complete whole.

1751
02:03:20.845 --> 02:03:23.086
The form, and this form

1752
02:03:23.086 --> 02:03:27.496
is above, along, and below the ground.

1753
02:03:28.945 --> 02:03:31.536
See this temple as three dimensional.

1754
02:03:33.406 --> 02:03:35.825
As you hold these images, visualize

1755
02:03:35.825 --> 02:03:37.875
a circle opening.

1756
02:03:38.426 --> 02:03:40.686
And send your intent to this temple

1757
02:03:40.686 --> 02:03:45.016
by saying out loud, by my conscious intent

1758
02:03:45.945 --> 02:03:48.556
I ask this whole temple be open.

1759
02:03:49.846 --> 02:03:53.106
A temple of light, to serve my highest interests.

1760
02:03:53.106 --> 02:03:56.086
For the highest good of the local spirit.

1761
02:03:56.086 --> 02:03:58.955
And the highest good of all.

1762
02:04:02.006 --> 02:04:03.525
It is done.

1763
02:04:03.525 --> 02:04:05.835
This portal is now open.

1764
02:04:08.904 --> 02:04:10.125
At this moment,

1765
02:04:10.125 --> 02:04:12.504
some people feel as though a pulse of energy

1766
02:04:12.504 --> 02:04:14.285
has exploded through them.

1767
02:04:14.285 --> 02:04:17.614
Like ripples in a pond expanding through the land.

1768
02:04:19.525 --> 02:04:21.765
For this is precisely what happens when you have

1769
02:04:21.765 --> 02:04:23.575
a living energy temple.

1770
02:04:34.464 --> 02:04:36.205
As you enter the temple,

1771
02:04:36.205 --> 02:04:38.975
be aware of any difference in your body.

1772
02:04:40.544 --> 02:04:45.534
it may feel warmer, there may be a tingling of the forearms,

1773
02:04:46.724 --> 02:04:49.213
even a ringing sensation in the ear.

1774
02:04:51.124 --> 02:04:54.444
This is a natural process, caused by the amplification

1775
02:04:54.444 --> 02:04:57.483
of the local energy field as it interacts with

1776
02:04:57.483 --> 02:05:01.034
the magnetism and the water that makes up your body.

1777
02:05:03.083 --> 02:05:06.123
Since this energy will also be spiraling very tightly

1778
02:05:06.123 --> 02:05:08.124
inside a temple now,

1779
02:05:08.124 --> 02:05:10.724
now may even feel slightly disoriented

1780
02:05:10.724 --> 02:05:12.713
until you get used to it.

1781
02:05:47.484 --> 02:05:50.283
This portal may remain open indefinitely.

1782
02:05:50.283 --> 02:05:53.523
If like a plant, you feed it regularly with your

1783
02:05:53.523 --> 02:05:55.852
attention and intention.

1784
02:05:56.903 --> 02:05:58.683
In a short moment of reinforcement,

1785
02:05:58.683 --> 02:06:00.172
is all it takes.

1786
02:06:03.143 --> 02:06:06.183
However for those of you who are not energy junkies,

1787
02:06:06.183 --> 02:06:09.363
whenever you complete your business inside the portal,

1788
02:06:09.363 --> 02:06:13.473
you can close it by applying your attention and intention.

1789
02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:19.401
Visualize the whole structure above, along, and below

1790
02:06:19.401 --> 02:06:21.271
the ground.

1791
02:06:22.081 --> 02:06:24.931
And then visualize a circle closing around it.

1792
02:06:26.121 --> 02:06:28.851
You can reinforce this with your hands.

1793
02:06:30.581 --> 02:06:33.691
With strong intent, say out loud,

1794
02:06:34.341 --> 02:06:37.021
In the name of the light, I close the energy field

1795
02:06:37.021 --> 02:06:38.731
inside this temple.

1796
02:06:39.661 --> 02:06:42.311
Let it always be protected by the light.

1797
02:06:46.501 --> 02:06:48.291
It is done.

1798
02:06:50.201 --> 02:06:52.761
This is also a good time if you wish.

1799
02:06:52.761 --> 02:06:56.011
To consciously break contact with the energy of the temple.

1800
02:06:57.401 --> 02:06:59.361
Some people do this because they find

1801
02:06:59.361 --> 02:07:02.791
that being energetically attached to it, is too draining.

1802
02:07:04.341 --> 02:07:06.931
Here's a very simple technique you could do.

1803
02:07:08.481 --> 02:07:11.021
Visualize your legs as roots that penetrate

1804
02:07:11.021 --> 02:07:12.751
deep into the earth.

1805
02:07:14.101 --> 02:07:16.721
Now retract those roots back into your body,

1806
02:07:16.721 --> 02:07:20.991
and with strong intent, say break contact.

1807
02:07:22.861 --> 02:07:25.031
Clap your hands to reinforce it.

1808
02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:28.641
And discharge all excess electromagnetic energy

1809
02:07:28.641 --> 02:07:31.141
from your body by simply flicking your fingers

1810
02:07:31.141 --> 02:07:33.591
to disperse it out and away.

1811
02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:39.051
You should now feel quite holy.

1812
02:07:47.741 --> 02:07:49.081
Earlier in this program,

1813
02:07:49.081 --> 02:07:50.681
I said that my own living space

1814
02:07:50.681 --> 02:07:53.651
was based on the principles you have been taught here.

1815
02:07:56.721 --> 02:07:58.821
Using my apartment as an example,

1816
02:07:58.821 --> 02:08:00.940
and I bet you've never seen a man's living space

1817
02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:02.760
look this tidy.

1818
02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:05.921
The elements in the room were arranged to amplify

1819
02:08:05.921 --> 02:08:08.330
the things I need most in my life.

1820
02:08:09.621 --> 02:08:11.961
My intent was to create an environment conducive

1821
02:08:11.961 --> 02:08:13.691
to creativity.

1822
02:08:14.681 --> 02:08:17.341
my second big intent was to be grateful for the fruits

1823
02:08:17.341 --> 02:08:19.761
of my labor, to honor the harvest

1824
02:08:19.761 --> 02:08:21.910
of my incoming abundance.

1825
02:08:22.921 --> 02:08:24.341
And to give thanks for the wonderful

1826
02:08:24.341 --> 02:08:26.341
apartments I manifested during a time

1827
02:08:26.341 --> 02:08:28.810
of particularly challenging circumstances.

1828
02:08:30.801 --> 02:08:32.321
And so in my living room,

1829
02:08:32.321 --> 02:08:34.900
there are strategically placed rocks and crystals

1830
02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:37.911
anchoring the form of a pentagram.

1831
02:08:38.561 --> 02:08:40.040
The geometry of life,

1832
02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:42.491
of flow, and creativity.

1833
02:08:44.461 --> 02:08:46.840
Notice how they are not resting on the floor

1834
02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:49.531
but interspersed among the furnishings.

1835
02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:52.340
Geometry can be three dimensional

1836
02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:54.411
as well as flat.

1837
02:08:55.981 --> 02:08:58.321
Because of the compact space of this room,

1838
02:08:58.321 --> 02:09:00.821
I chose the window closest to the southwest

1839
02:09:00.821 --> 02:09:02.790
to act as my entrance.

1840
02:09:03.821 --> 02:09:05.521
Of course, walking through the window

1841
02:09:05.521 --> 02:09:07.101
would be showing off.

1842
02:09:07.101 --> 02:09:09.561
So I used my imagination and figuratively

1843
02:09:09.561 --> 02:09:12.510
walk my body through that entrance.

1844
02:09:13.901 --> 02:09:15.660
When you use your imagination,

1845
02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:18.411
you are a magi, a magician.

1846
02:09:20.001 --> 02:09:22.240
And every afternoon, I can sit on my

1847
02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:25.981
horseshoe shaped sofa and face the southwest,

1848
02:09:25.981 --> 02:09:29.401
imagining an ingratitude for what I have been given

1849
02:09:29.401 --> 02:09:31.431
and will receive.

1850
02:09:34.041 --> 02:09:35.561
It is interesting that in asking

1851
02:09:35.561 --> 02:09:37.941
for such a creative female environment,

1852
02:09:37.941 --> 02:09:40.500
I should have vetted a female magnetic line

1853
02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:43.071
to run through the front of my apartment.

1854
02:09:43.821 --> 02:09:45.811
But there's more..

1855
02:09:46.701 --> 02:09:49.661
Because much of my year is spent teaching around the world,

1856
02:09:49.661 --> 02:09:52.270
I inevitably come home depleted of energy.

1857
02:09:53.361 --> 02:09:55.401
So it is important for me to have a sanctaury

1858
02:09:55.401 --> 02:09:57.821
where I can receive healing as well as

1859
02:09:57.821 --> 02:10:00.471
make sense of all I had experienced.

1860
02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:05.711
So I needed sanctuary of healing and understanding.

1861
02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:10.181
I also need a place to connect with all there is.

1862
02:10:10.181 --> 02:10:11.971
And complete unity.

1863
02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:15.440
The answer was to implement a stone circle

1864
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.811
based on nine-fold geometry.

1865
02:10:18.381 --> 02:10:20.411
With an entrance facing east.

1866
02:10:22.821 --> 02:10:26.561
Because space is a rare commodity where I live,

1867
02:10:26.561 --> 02:10:29.391
the circle's geometry has been flattened at the top.

1868
02:10:30.741 --> 02:10:33.240
After removing one of the geometry stones,

1869
02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:36.141
I placed the entrance stones to reference and anchor

1870
02:10:36.141 --> 02:10:37.611
the geometry.

1871
02:10:40.481 --> 02:10:42.701
This simple informal structure anchors

1872
02:10:42.701 --> 02:10:44.961
a second male magnetic line

1873
02:10:44.961 --> 02:10:47.771
that approaches the apartment from the rear.

1874
02:10:49.181 --> 02:10:51.521
And where this male line meets the female line

1875
02:10:51.521 --> 02:10:55.171
inside the building, these create a vortex in my bedroom,

1876
02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:58.660
needless to say, I tend to travel to distant

1877
02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:01.751
and unusual places in my sleep.

1878
02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:22.871
(ethereal chants)

1879
02:11:32.161 --> 02:11:35.561
Now that you understand how to harness elemental forces.

1880
02:11:35.561 --> 02:11:39.830
It is crucial to do so with integrity and responsibility.

1881
02:11:42.801 --> 02:11:46.241
You see once the human body circulatory channels

1882
02:11:46.241 --> 02:11:48.521
are in close contact with cosmic principles

1883
02:11:48.521 --> 02:11:50.461
inside the temple,

1884
02:11:50.461 --> 02:11:54.291
proper energy flow is achieved at all levels of self.

1885
02:11:55.521 --> 02:11:58.310
And the co-creative process is enforced.

1886
02:12:12.801 --> 02:12:14.940
The Hindu use the symbol to reflect the state

1887
02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:16.771
of connection and balance.

1888
02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:21.110
However energy is neither good nor bad.

1889
02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:23.351
it is simply energy.

1890
02:12:24.041 --> 02:12:26.710
And that makes cosmic forces a two way street.

1891
02:12:28.241 --> 02:12:30.840
And what your intent brings to this energy

1892
02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:33.891
will define its direction and its use.

1893
02:12:35.401 --> 02:12:38.001
Therefore, the principles of temple making,

1894
02:12:38.001 --> 02:12:41.541
when applied by someone with an unbalanced association

1895
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:45.281
with material forces, together with incorrect intent,

1896
02:12:45.281 --> 02:12:48.251
can lead to disastrous consequences.

1897
02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.221
So always use what you have learned here

1898
02:12:52.221 --> 02:12:56.270
with integrity and always for the highest good of all.

1899
02:12:59.801 --> 02:13:03.441
Let us close them by observing the seven universal laws

1900
02:13:03.441 --> 02:13:04.971
of manifestation.

1901
02:13:17.181 --> 02:13:18.800
You cannot manifest what is not

1902
02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:21.251
in accordance with your soul's purpose.

1903
02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:25.160
This is because your soul while subconscious,

1904
02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:27.910
rules not your ego.

1905
02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:31.139
Your soul may have other plans.

1906
02:13:31.139 --> 02:13:34.180
Or a purpose that you may not be conscious of.

1907
02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:38.220
Which means be careful what you ask for.

1908
02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:40.089
You may manifest it.

1909
02:13:41.339 --> 02:13:43.600
If you push a situation and allow your ego

1910
02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.540
to force its will, you may end of manifesting

1911
02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:48.800
something that is the very opposite of what ultimately

1912
02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:51.310
is in your best interests.

1913
02:13:52.739 --> 02:13:54.980
And this will happen in order to return you

1914
02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:57.550
to your correct path of experience.

1915
02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:04.000
You cannot manifest what is not in accordance

1916
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.450
with the purpose of the local spirit.

1917
02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:10.780
Manifesting requires sympathetic resonance

1918
02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:13.610
between you and the spirit of place.

1919
02:14:14.119 --> 02:14:16.360
No matter where you do your work.

1920
02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:19.710
This is why we are drawn to a certain place.

1921
02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:21.919
Or a house, or a apartment.

1922
02:14:21.919 --> 02:14:24.820
Because our underlying purpose and intent

1923
02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:28.090
is felt by the over widening spirit of place.

1924
02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:32.840
One way to know for sure is when you are surrounded

1925
02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:36.830
by a sense of effortlessness, and joy in the work you do.

1926
02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:43.050
What is the intent behind your intent?

1927
02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:47.670
Do you really, really, really mean it?

1928
02:14:48.759 --> 02:14:50.629
Be honest with yourself.

1929
02:14:51.499 --> 02:14:53.840
Is what you are trying to manifest realistic

1930
02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:56.070
or is it coming from ego.

1931
02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:01.170
You will know the answer when your gut feeling reminds you,

1932
02:15:01.959 --> 02:15:04.680
if your stomach muscles retract when you make a request.

1933
02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:06.539
That's a que from your body asking you

1934
02:15:06.539 --> 02:15:08.569
to question yourself.

1935
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:15.570
Always manifest for the highest good of all.

1936
02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:20.179
You are a cog in a huge machine,

1937
02:15:20.179 --> 02:15:23.240
therefore it stands to reason if everyone and all

1938
02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:25.340
benefit from your request.

1939
02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:29.650
Then manifestation occurs more readily and effortlessly.

1940
02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:38.650
Lack of trust is an obstacle to pure manifestation.

1941
02:15:40.079 --> 02:15:42.840
This is perhaps the most important law.

1942
02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:45.390
You must believe the process.

1943
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:49.580
The ping of doubt releases a packet of energy

1944
02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:51.930
that tells the universe you are not ready.

1945
02:15:52.959 --> 02:15:54.720
And just like a log in the river,

1946
02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:57.770
it jams the forces you have attracted for your benefit.

1947
02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:01.230
So don't short-circuit the process.

1948
02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.490
Trust.

1949
02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:10.210
Physical and spiritual cohabit separate time zones.

1950
02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:14.950
Don't keep wondering when is this going to happen.

1951
02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:18.590
Unfortunately, time is immaterial in the spirit world.

1952
02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:22.110
And like a good joke, timing is everything.

1953
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:25.269
So practice patience.

1954
02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:29.610
(ethereal chants)

1955
02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.099
Remember that whenever you feel this connected

1956
02:16:36.099 --> 02:16:38.160
you are holey.

1957
02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.340
But by working with a temple of connection,

1958
02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:42.250
you become wholy.

1959
02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:45.070
Or in today's language, holy.

1960
02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.880
Use this force responsibly,

1961
02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:51.769
use it to reconnect with the source.

1962
02:16:52.420 --> 02:16:53.760
Because in doing so,

1963
02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:55.549
you become a sourcerer.

1964
02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.720
And speaking of the force,

1965
02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:01.579
the word Jedi is derrived the Djed,

1966
02:17:01.579 --> 02:17:05.250
the Egyptian pillar representing the supreme life force.

1967
02:17:06.539 --> 02:17:08.340
So to be a Jedi in this world,

1968
02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:11.120
is to be a master of white light.

1969
02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.700
And just to prove that anything is possible,

1970
02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:15.420
when you work with these principles,

1971
02:17:15.420 --> 02:17:17.820
consider that in the United Kingdom,

1972
02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:22.409
in 2001, Jedi became an official religion.

1973
02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:26.549
(ethereal music)

1974
02:21:17.672 --> 02:21:19.702
<v ->Do it again?</v>
