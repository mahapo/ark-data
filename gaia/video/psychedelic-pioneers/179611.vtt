00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The Saskatchewan Hospital
near the small prairie town

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.765 align:middle line:84%
of Weyburn holds a remarkable
yet little-known story.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Long abandoned,
these rooms and halls

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
were witness to a project
far ahead of its time.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Beginning in 1952, cutting-edge
psychiatric research

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.042 align:middle line:84%
used LSD to unlock the mysteries
of human consciousness.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:84%
LSD promised an
entirely new approach

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to understanding the mind, an
inward passage to our truer

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and richer selves.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But a decade later,
in the 1960s,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
LSD was used to fuel
a cultural revolution,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
resulting in one of the
most controversial periods

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:90%
in Canadian history.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:84%
At the center of the
storm were three doctors.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Abram Hoffer, a native
of Saskatchewan,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
gained an international
reputation

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:84%
as Canada's pre-eminent
LSD researcher.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> After taking LSD, I knew--

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:84%
quotation marks-- what it was
like to have been mentally ill.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Humphry Osmond, a
freethinking psychiatrist,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:84%
became a cult figure in
the world of psychedelics.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> For myself, these experiences
have been most strange,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
most awesome, and
in their own way,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
amongst the most
beautiful in my life.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And Duncan Blewett, a
charismatic psychologist,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
was an early advocate for
the personal use of LSD.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The government makes $11
million a year in Saskatchewan

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:90%
off liquor.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
They could double that off LSD
without any trouble at all.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Innovative work with
LSD put Hoffer, Osmond,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and Blewett at the forefront
of a radical new science.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But fear and hostility
to psychedelic drugs

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
made them victims of
social and political forces

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:90%
beyond their control.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
From the depths of
the human psyche

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
to the center of
political turmoil,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.018 align:middle line:84%
this is this strange true trip
of the psychedelic pioneers.

00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:48.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
In 1920, when the Saskatchewan
Hospital was built,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:84%
a debilitating disease called
schizophrenia had claimed

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:90%
millions of victims worldwide.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Schizophrenics live
in a world where

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:84%
thought patterns, emotions,
and perceptions constantly

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:90%
shift, where nothing is stable.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They filled hospital
wards beyond capacity,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:90%
and seemed to be untreatable.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
In 1950, in London, England,
a young psychiatrist

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
named Humphry Osmond was
studying schizophrenia.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
With a creativity that
would define his career,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Osmond used a
radical new approach.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
He began experimenting
with mescaline,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
one of a group of
hallucinogenic drugs

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:90%
that alter human perception.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens, in fact,
is that you do see the world

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:10%
in a different sort of way--

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:10%
totally different.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:10%
And you get the
picture of a world

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:10%
as one imagines the great
artists can sometimes see,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:10%
a world of tremendously
color, of great significance,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:10%
of great beauty, but also
at times of great terror.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Osmond was convinced his
mescaline-induced experience

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
was similar to the inner
world of the schizophrenic.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
He shocked the medical
community by suggesting

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that schizophrenia might be
a form of self-intoxication

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
caused by the body
mistakenly producing

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
its own hallucinogenic
compounds.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
This implied an entirely new
line of psychiatric research.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
When his ideas were rejected
by the English medical

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
establishment, Osmond
decided to leave London.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:10%
In 1951, Osmond arrived at
the Saskatchewan Hospital

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:10%
in Weyburn and was soon
promoted to superintendent,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:10%
the top position.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:84%
At the University
Hospital in Saskatoon,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Osmond was pleased to
discover a research

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:90%
study focused on schizophrenia.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
The study was headed by Abram
Hoffer, a gifted researcher

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
with the unusual
combination of degrees

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:90%
in biochemistry and psychiatry.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Hoffer and Osmond
quickly joined forces.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
With Hoffer's tenacity
and Osmond's creativity,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
they were a remarkable
combination.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You think of 1,000 ideas and
throw away all the bad ones.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.889 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
was Humphry Osmond.

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:10%
That was one of the
amazing thing about it.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:10%
He was so brilliant, and
he was a marvelous writer.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Any writing skills I have
now-- and I have a few,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:90%
not that many--

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up by
working with Dr. Osmond.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> In the early 1950s when
Humphry Osmond arrived,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
the Saskatchewan Hospital,
overcrowded and filthy,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
was one of the worst
in North America.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:10%
But there was political
will to improve conditions.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:10%
>> The government was the CCF
government under Tommy Douglas,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:10%
who was a brilliant leader.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:10%
And he had spent
three months working

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.532 align:middle line:10%
as an intern at the
Saskatchewan Hospital in Weyburn

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:10%
so he knew pretty well
what was going on there.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And he decided that he'd
have to bring health back

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:10%
to some kind of modernity.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Tommy Douglas was premier of
the first socialist government

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
in North America, a government
known for innovation

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and sweeping social change.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Under Douglas, Hoffer and
Osmond were protected and given

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:90%
remarkable freedom.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Osmond used the opportunity to
gather from around the world

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:84%
every known
hallucinogenic substance.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
With the goal of finding
a cure for schizophrenia

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and with considerable
courage, Osmond

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
evaluated the properties
of these substances

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:90%
by testing them on himself.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Osmond was also a
brilliant administrator.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
In just five years, he
transformed the Saskatchewan

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Hospital.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
It became recognized
as a world leader

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:84%
in research, serving as a magnet
for mental health professionals

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%
One of those drawn was
an American psychologist,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Robert Sommer.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a very
liberal environment.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:10%
I as a researcher could do
all sorts of things there--

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:10%
that Humphry became
superintendent, this really--

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:10%
creative people like
that don't become

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:10%
hospital superintendents.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And the whole climate
was experimental.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's try it.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.955 align:middle line:90%
See what works.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It has a peculiar glow.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.600 align:middle line:84%
It is alternatively a
swelling and contracting.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:90%
This is most interesting.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> By 1952, Hoffer and Osmond
had assembled a team to study

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:90%
schizophrenia.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Expanding on Osmond's
ideas from England,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
they based the research on
finding a biochemical cause

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:90%
for the disease.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
This focus contravened
mainstream psychiatry,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
then fixed on the belief that
the cause of schizophrenia

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:90%
was entirely psychological.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Within the body
of schizophrenics,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Hoffer and Osmond looked
for the abnormal production

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
of compounds that had
hallucinogenic properties.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
compounds they identified

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
was a derivative of adrenaline
called adrenochrome.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:10%
>> New chemicals allow
us to experience some

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:10%
of the unbelievably unpleasant
and sometimes quite terrifying

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:10%
mental agonies of a
schizophrenic patient--

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:10%
to some extent, to put ourselves
in his shoes for a few hours.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffer and Osmond's first
rule in testing compounds was

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:90%
to do it yourself.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.250 align:middle line:84%
They believed that to fully
understand schizophrenia,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
they needed
temporarily to become

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:90%
schizophrenic themselves.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> We found that after taking
adrenochrome and adrenolutin,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
we were drawn into the
experience much more than with

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.910 align:middle line:90%
other psychosis-producing drugs.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
We lived the experience more,
like real schizophrenia.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But adrenochrome proved
unstable and difficult to work

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So Hoffer and Osmond
turned to a new drug

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
from the same group of
hallucinogens as mescalin.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
It had just become available,
and it was called LSD.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:10%
LSD was discovered during
the Second World War

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:10%
at Sandoz, a Swiss
pharmaceutical company.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Chemist Albert Hoffman was
experimenting with ergot,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:90%
a fungus that grows on wheat.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
On April 16, 1943,
Hoffman accidentally

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
absorbed a minute
amount of lysurgic acid

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
diethylamide 25, and took
the first trip on LSD.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
One effect of LSD is to disable
neurotransmitters in the brain.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Information arriving from
the senses is filtered,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and the mind fills up
with sensations, memories,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The impact on the
mind is profound,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
creating an altered
state of consciousness

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
totally outside the realm
of ordinary experience.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Reality is transformed.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
The world is perceived rich
with meaning and significance.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Hoffer and Osmond obtained
LSD from Sandoz in 1952.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
After they had tested
the drug on themselves,

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:84%
they began working
with normal subjects.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
They used LSD as the
psychomimetic, where

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
for a brief time the subject
entered a drug-induced state

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
that mimicked psychosis.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
They could then test out
methods of treatment,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
assuming that if the treatments
affected normal subjects,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
they might affect
actual schizophrenics.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Already, we have learned
enough to feel that we are no

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:84%
longer guessing, no longer
depending only on sensitivity

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to gain access to the
world of our patients.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffer and Osmond's
use of LSD in the study

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
of schizophrenia was a time
when drug therapy was in its

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:90%
infancy.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, when their
work was published

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
in leading medical
journals, they

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
attracted international
attention.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
One of those attracted was
psychologist Duncan Blewett,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
who came to Saskatchewan from
the University of Illinois.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:10%
>> They had a research project
which said essentially,

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:10%
we don't know what causes
schizophrenia but we're going

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:10%
to find out, and we're going
to do something about it,

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:10%
and it's happening here.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
That notion was really
a revolutionary idea.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Blewett immediately
understood the tremendous

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
potential of LSD and in 1954
became part of the Saskatchewan

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:90%
research group.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Another drawn to the
work of Hoffer and Osmond

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
was Aldous Huxley, best known
for the futuristic novel "Brave

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:90%
New World."

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Huxley had read about
Osmond's work with mescaline.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.944 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, he invited
Osmond to Los Angeles.

00:12:22.944 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>> He hoped that I'd
give him mescaline,

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
because he'd been
cleared by his doctor.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:10%
So I had no way out, really.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:10%
And so as I--

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:10%
on the second last
day of my visit,

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:10%
I stood stirring in
the mescaline which

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:10%
has a strange oily
swirl, and I wondered

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:10%
if I would be remembered as a
man who'd gone to California

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:10%
and driven Aldous Huxley mad.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Far from inducing madness,
Osmond instead created a high

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:90%
of historic importance.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Huxley felt mescaline
expanded the limitations

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
of his nervous system, revealing
the wonders of existence

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to a self-centered
and earthbound mind.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The results of the
experience led Huxley in 1954

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to write his seminal book,
"The Doors of Perception."

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In your book about
mescaline recently,

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
you talked of a valuable state
of heightened perception,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:84%
being induced by
drugs, by proper drugs.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you think imaginative
writers would benefit by that?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it would be extremely
good for almost anybody with

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:84%
the fixed ideas and with a great
certainty about what's what

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:84%
to take this thing and to
realize that the world he has

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
constructed is by no
means the only world--

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
extraordinary other types

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
of universe which we may inhabit
and which we should be very

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:84%
grateful for
inhabiting, I think.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Osmond and Huxley
became close friends.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
In 1956, by corresponding
with Huxley from Weyburn,

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Osmond coined the
word that would

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
secure his place in the
history of the counterculture.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Aldus suggested
phanerothyme--

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
"phaneroin," to reveal
and "thumos" for soul.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And he then wrote
this little rhyme--

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:84%
"To make this mundane
world sublime,

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
take half a gram
of phanerothyme."

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this
was wonderful word,

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
but rather too difficult
for most people.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:90%
It was a Huxley word.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote back to
him, having looked up

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:84%
in the dictionary the fact that
the word psyche, of course,

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.150 align:middle line:84%
was available and so
was deluon, to reveal,

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:90%
and about half a dozen others.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But I fixed on psychedelic and
wrote back "to fall in Hell

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:84%
or soar angelic, you'll need
a pinch of psychedelic."

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>> From the inner
reaches of his mind,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Humphry Osmond's concept of
psychedelic went out to change

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:90%
the lives of millions worldwide.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
In 1954, LSD research
in Saskatchewan

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
moved in an entirely
new direction.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It was a study that
involved alcoholics.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Alcoholics had been
classified as a character

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.530 align:middle line:10%
Freud didn't feel that they
were treatable by psychoanalysis

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:10%
because you couldn't
establish a relationship.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:10%
They didn't have
any libido despair.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you talk to this
person, but you're making

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:90%
no emotional impression on him.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.966 align:middle line:84%
>> We knew about AA,
Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:15:41.966 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of their
basic principles

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.065 align:middle line:84%
was that often you have to hit
bottom before you did well.

00:15:47.065 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the danger
of hitting bottom

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:90%
is the high mortality rate.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:84%
How can we get these guys to
hit bottom without any danger?

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:10%
So it occurred to me, let's take
these alcoholics in hospital,

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.752 align:middle line:10%
give them LSD, give them
a terrible experience,

00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:10%
and when they come
out of it, we'll

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:10%
tell them if you
keep on drinking,

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:10%
that's going to happen to you.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:10%
We thought we would use the
whip to frighten them away

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:10%
from drinking.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But the results were
different than expected.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Humphry began to use that
treatment with his psychologist

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.154 align:middle line:90%
at Weyburn.

00:16:30.154 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we're
not getting this kind

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.481 align:middle line:90%
of terrible experience.

00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But these guys, he said,
are beginning to enjoy.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
It.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:90%
They like the experience.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:10%
And this began to happen
so frequently that he

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:10%
said this is a new phenomena.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I come up for a minute?

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly, David.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Without realizing it, Hoffer
and Osmond had discovered

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic therapy.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you making out?

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That was magnificent.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The transcendental nature
of the LSD experience gave

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
alcoholics a clear view of
their motivations for drinking

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and helped foster
self-understanding

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:90%
and self-acceptance.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.808 align:middle line:84%
>> My feeling was that, in
this, that if you're looking

00:17:15.808 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:84%
for paradise, that after this
experience you began to realize

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that it's right here,
wherever you happen to be,

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:90%
like where we're sitting.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> During treatment sessions,
researchers began to take LSD

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:90%
along with alcoholics.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
This practice was perfected
by Duncan Blewett, who

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
found that between
doctor and patient

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
LSD created a powerful
empathetic bond.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Well supposing that somebody
said that more therapy could be

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:10%
done with LSD in an afternoon
than could be done in 15 years

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:10%
without it, what would
your response be,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:10%
especially if you
were a psychiatrist?

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
You had a material which
could produce humans who

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:90%
really understood themselves.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The Saskatchewan group
worked with the most seriously

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
addicted.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Of 3,000 alcoholics
treated, approximately 50%

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:84%
experienced recovery, a
remarkable rate of success when

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
compared to 20% for
Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
By the late 1950s,
psychotherapeutic reactions

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to LSD were being explored
by research groups worldwide.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
In Menlo Park, California, Myron
Stolaroff founded the Institute

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:90%
for Psychedelic Research.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of us have so much stuff
to weigh in the unconscious,

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:10%
what Carl Jung calls the shadow.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:10%
And the reason we stuff
it away is because it's

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:10%
generally painful material
and we don't want to know it,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:10%
we don't want to experience it.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So what LSD does-- one of the
great things that it does,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:84%
it begins to dissolve
those barriers

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and gives us access
to our unconscious.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Through his work, Stolaroff
off became associated with Al

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Hubbard, one of the most
colorful personalities

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:90%
in the history of LSD.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Hubbard, from the
backwoods of Kentucky,

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:84%
had become an expert
in psychedelic drugs,

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:90%
first taking LSD in 1951.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Known as Captain Trips, Hubbard
used his eccentric charm

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
to convince some of the
most influential people

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:90%
on the planet to try LSD.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> He had a lot of different
approaches in telling people,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
like we're inside of a huge
barrel and there's only

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
a couple holes
where I see through.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're
locked in this, and we

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what the
world is really like

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
or what we're
really like, and LSD

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:84%
allows you to
dissolve that barrier

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and see the world
as it really which

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:90%
is fantastic and enormous.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Although Hubbard's
methods were unorthodox,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:84%
he was associated with leading
cultural figures like Aldous

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Huxley and with legitimate
researchers like Humphry

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Osmond.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It was through Hubbard
that the Saskatchewan group

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.862 align:middle line:84%
began to refine their
psychedelic method.

00:20:16.862 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:10%
>> By this time, we were
treating large numbers

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:10%
of alcoholic patients with LSD.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:10%
So we said to Al Hubbard, why
don't you come and show us

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:10%
what you do.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:90%
We set aside a room.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
We had psychologists,
the workers, and myself.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
We had all the
controls we needed.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
He brought in
pictures and music,

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and we saw him work and
we liked what he did.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> He knew more about
acid than anybody I knew,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
than Humphry or Huxley
or anybody else.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:90%
It came naturally to him.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It was part of his persona.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think LSD would
have been the same in Canada

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.797 align:middle line:90%
without him.

00:20:59.797 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It would have had a
different history.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1959, based on his
experiences with Hubbard,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Blewett co-wrote "The Handbook
for the Therapeutic Use

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of LSD," still regarded as the
definitive guide of how to use

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:90%
LSD in psychotherapy.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
In 1956, Hoffer,
Osmond, and Blewett

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
took part in a peyote ceremony
near North Battlefield

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
with members of the
Native American church.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Peyote, the source
of mescaline, was

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
used in the church
as a sacrament

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.809 align:middle line:84%
and as an expression of
cultural nationalism, which

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:50.725 align:middle line:84%
the federal government
was trying to suppress.

00:21:50.725 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:84%
The Saskatchewan group
attended the ceremony

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to show that not everyone
was hostile to the aims

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:90%
of the church.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Osmond published an
account of the experience

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:90%
in the magazine "Tomorrow."

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
My colleagues and I had decided
that while they would watch

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
the ceremony, I
should take part in it

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:90%
and observe from the inside.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Although I have used a variety
of mind-changing substances,

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.265 align:middle line:90%
I had never taken peyote.

00:22:20.265 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:90%
Peyote works slowly and subtly.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
It is well-suited
for gatherings where

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.440 align:middle line:84%
people who do not
share a common language

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
worship together
and explore reality

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:90%
without the cushion of words.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.300 align:middle line:84%
We were experiencing something
that cannot be contained

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.710 align:middle line:90%
by language.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Music or poetry come closer.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I was a stranger
whom they had allowed

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:90%
to enter into their mystery.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I thanked them
for their kindness

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and told them that I would
tell people about their worship

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.865 align:middle line:90%
clearly and honestly.

00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
In 1957, the
Saskatchewan group began

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
using LSD in a way that was
to have a lasting influence.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.730 align:middle line:84%
They began to explore
psychedelic-enhanced

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:90%
creativity.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most famous
volunteers of the study

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
were members of a renowned group
of artists, the Regina Five.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But the most
influential work focused

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.660 align:middle line:84%
on one of Humphry
Osmond's lifelong goals--

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:84%
improving the design
of mental institutions.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We look forward to a day when
these great buildings will no

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
longer be needed to house
backlogs of long stay patients,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:84%
when small hospitals not more
than an hour's ride from home

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
will treat our patients and
give a decent measure of privacy

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.435 align:middle line:90%
while they're in.

00:23:59.435 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>> In Regina, Kiyo Izumi,
an MIT-trained architect,

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
had been commissioned to
design a new psychiatric center

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:90%
in Yorkton.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
In approaching the design
for a much smaller hospital,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Izumi became the first
architect to use LSD.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, I took
it at the suggestion Dr.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:10%
Osmond who thought that it
might aid in my understanding

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:10%
of the nature of the illness,
schizophrenia, and also,

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:10%
in actual fact, experience some
of the perceptual distortions

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.968 align:middle line:10%
that these people experienced.

00:24:35.968 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Aware of how vast spaces
disorient schizophrenics,

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Izumi created more intimate
settings with rooms that allow

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.901 align:middle line:90%
for privacy and reflection.

00:25:03.901 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:84%
One of four institutions
built by Izumi

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
after his LSD experience,
the Yorkton Hospital

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
won an award for
innovative design

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
from the American
Psychiatric Association.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The results of this
work, which Osborne

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
called socio-architecture,
were drawn on

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
by the National Institute
on Mental Health

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.534 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC.

00:25:27.534 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Through Humphry's influence,
they established the first

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.914 align:middle line:84%
architectural psychology program
at the University of Utah.

00:25:33.914 --> 00:25:36.205 align:middle line:84%
It was a joint effort between
the psychology department

00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and the architecture department.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Then, at the City
University of New York,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:84%
they established the
environmental psychology

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
program and a big research
program in mental hospitals

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.400 align:middle line:84%
All that came from the
socio-architectural work.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> By 1960, influential artists
and writers were experimenting

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
with LSD, including
William Burroughs,

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
mentor of the American
Beats, and Allen Ginsberg,

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
poet laureate of a
growing LSD subculture.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Harvard University
professor, Timothy Leary,

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:84%
who was to become the
self-proclaimed high priest

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of LSD, had his first
experience in 1962.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The growing awareness
of LSD would

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:84%
have serious consequences for
Hoffer, Osmond, and Blewett.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
In 1961, the political landscape
changed in Saskatchewan

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
when Tommy Douglas
left for Ottawa

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.980 align:middle line:84%
to become leader of the
federal New Democrats.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the first to react to
the change was Humphry Osmond.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
In June of 1961, Osmond
resigned his post at Weyburn

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and moved to Princeton,
where he became

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
director of psychiatric research
for the state of New Jersey.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Losing Osmond was a major blow
to the Saskatchewan group,

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:90%
especially for Abram Hoffer.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.121 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very
happy when he left.

00:27:10.121 --> 00:27:13.470 align:middle line:84%
If I had to have a fight--
if I had to defend myself

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.594 align:middle line:84%
with someone at my
back, just the two of us

00:27:15.594 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
against the world, it
would be Humphry Osmond.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It was just at that
time in the early 1960s

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:90%
that Hoffer was in for a fight.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The idea that psychedelics could
circumvent traditional therapy

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:84%
was viewed with hostility
by mainstream psychiatry.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Reports about the
harmful effects of LSD

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:84%
which were never substantiated
began to appear in the media.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> That created a tremendous
amount of ill will

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.740 align:middle line:90%
and hostility.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:10%
And I think this hostility
that was pervasive

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.059 align:middle line:10%
carried on for a
long time afterwards.

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:10%
They didn't really see
what we were trying to do.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.779 align:middle line:10%
We weren't trying to get the
whole world to take drugs.

00:27:57.779 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we advised against it.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. James Tyhurst, head of
psychiatry at the University

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
of British Columbia, was
one early critic of LSD.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> If it is made
generally available,

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:84%
it might become the
focus of cultist groups.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:84%
That is, in the same way as
the nitrous oxide used to be.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:25.971 align:middle line:84%
That is, it can be used to
have so-called experiences.

00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's laughing gas
you're talking about.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's
right, laughing gas.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:31.847 align:middle line:84%
And can have
experiences, as you know,

00:28:31.847 --> 00:28:33.930 align:middle line:84%
some people have written
on this and have actually

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.400 align:middle line:84%
suggested that the experience
obtained from the lysurgic acid

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:90%
has mystical religious values.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The federal government,
citing negative studies from

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the medical community, reacted
to the growing controversy.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We're very concerned about
these hallucinogenic drugs,

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.014 align:middle line:90%
especially LSD.

00:28:52.014 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
The medical evidence we have,
there is no doubt whatsoever

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:90%
it causes physiological harm.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> A bill now before
parliament would ban LSD,

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:84%
restricting its use to research
purposes which are not clearly

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:90%
defined.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:84%
During the past
week, some doctors

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:84%
have expressed
anxieties over the bill.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.930 align:middle line:10%
They say proper LSD studies or
treatment could be interfered

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:10%
with, but the government
could be limiting

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:10%
the scope of medical research.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:10%
>> In an attempt to save a
decade of research now under

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:10%
siege, Abram Hoffer became a
familiar figure in the national

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:10%
media.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It is certainly possible
that LSD in some people can

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:10%
precipitate a psychosis.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:90%
There are cases on record.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, where
something like this

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
goes wrong, I tend to blame
the therapist more than I

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
do the drug, because
I think in many cases,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:84%
not in all, but
in many cases, it

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.912 align:middle line:84%
has been given to
the wrong person.

00:29:47.912 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> What has gone wrong?

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
People have committed
suicide, have they not?

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there have
been suicides reported.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cohen reported a
study on 50,000 treatments

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.590 align:middle line:90%
with 5 suicides.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.130 align:middle line:84%
This indicates to me that
LSD is as safe, if not safer,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:90%
than psychotherapy.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:10%
>> But Hoffer's point
of view was ignored.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:10%
Following the American lead,
the Canadian government in 1963

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:10%
placed strict controls on
the use of LSD for research.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It was also more difficult to
obtain the drug from Sandoz,

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.320 align:middle line:84%
the only legal supplier of LSD,
as the company was beginning

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:90%
to fear for its reputation.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Across North America,
recreational use

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:41.060 align:middle line:84%
of LSD from black market sources
was becoming more pronounced.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:84%
In 1963, LSD first
appeared on cubes of sugar.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:84%
During the first big
surge of street acid,

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:84%
crude approximations of the
drug became widely available

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:90%
on college campuses.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> When I left the
government, I started working

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:90%
for the university.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:10%
It was just at that
time when LSD began to--

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:10%
it used to be a medical problem
and was a university problem.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> At the University of Regina,
Duncan Blewett had been hired

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to develop the
Department of Psychology.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:84%
With nearly 10 years
of experience with LSD,

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Blewett's knowledge
was valued by students.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
One student who
approached Blewett

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.622 align:middle line:84%
was Simon de Jong, who later
became a member of parliament

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and a candidate for the
leadership of the federal New

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Democratic Party.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.487 align:middle line:10%
>> Very spontaneously, I went up
to him and I said, Dr. Blewett,

00:31:41.487 --> 00:31:43.320 align:middle line:10%
I would like to have
an experience with you.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
take LSD with you.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:10%
And Duncan at first was
somewhat taken aback and said,

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:10%
well, OK, and I think at
that moment we arranged

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:10%
for a time and a place.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:10%
>> With LSD use beginning
to permeate student life,

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:10%
Blewett attempted to convince
the university to back formal

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.030 align:middle line:10%
studies on LSD.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
When they refused, he
remained an advocate

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.010 align:middle line:90%
for personal experimentation.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think at some stage
he says, well, then,

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:90%
this is too big.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:84%
This has grown out of the
boundaries of universities

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and university establishments
and the politics

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
within the university, that all
these petty things should not

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.680 align:middle line:84%
be capable of dragging
down and stopping such

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.777 align:middle line:90%
an important human invention.

00:32:31.777 --> 00:32:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.470 align:middle line:10%
>> But in the view
of Abram Hoffer,

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:10%
Blewett was putting the
Saskatchewan group's reputation

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:10%
at risk.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.710 align:middle line:10%
Hoffer expressed his
concerns in a letter

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:47.390 align:middle line:10%
to Humphry Osmond
in June of 1963.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:10%
Saskatchewan is now
being held as a model

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:10%
of how LSD can be used safely
in a controlled setting.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
There is a feeling among LSD
groups in the United States

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that we have saved LSD
research from extinction.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.050 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly
what we have tried

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.350 align:middle line:90%
to point out to Duncan Blewett.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:84%
What had initially brought
the group together,

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:84%
a belief in the incredible
potential of LSD,

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:90%
was now pulling it apart.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you have to make a
distinction between research

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and psychedelic exploration.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.475 align:middle line:10%
We were doing research.

00:33:23.475 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.722 align:middle line:84%
Blewett and the others were
doing something different.

00:33:30.722 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But that something
different was rapidly becoming

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:84%
an international
cultural movement.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:46.810 align:middle line:84%
By 1964, it was a movement
that had found a leader.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> This session tonight we're
going to use as the voyage

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.885 align:middle line:90%
into your own body.

00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The human brain receives several
billion signals a minute.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.389 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is being flooded
with millions of coded messages

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.719 align:middle line:84%
from all parts of your
body every second.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1963, Timothy Leary was
fired from Harvard University

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:84%
for involving students in
experiments with psychedelic

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:90%
drugs.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:84%
He resurfaced at Millbrook,
an estate in rural New York.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Leary used Millbrook
as a center from which

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to spread his message
of LSD for all.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I frankly don't think
that the human being is ready

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.380 align:middle line:90%
for LSD.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.213 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
don't think the human

00:34:47.213 --> 00:34:48.639 align:middle line:90%
being is ready for fire.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.395 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is, LSD
is here, and what are we

00:34:51.395 --> 00:34:52.270 align:middle line:90%
going to do about it?

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Should we pass a
law against fire

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and say only doctors
can have fire?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Should we pass a law
against LSD and say

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:84%
only doctors can take
this trip, divine process,

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
go out of their minds,
use this in a microscope?

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can't,
because it's here,

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to be used.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> To those involved in
serious research with LSD,

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Leary was turning their
enterprise into a party.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Psychologist
Stanley Krippner had

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:84%
been a volunteer in Leary's
experiments at Harvard.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:26.560 align:middle line:10%
>> I disagreed with my friend
Timothy Leary who really wanted

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:10%
it spread to the masses.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:32.180 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I'm not
an elitist, but I

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:10%
think that these
drugs are best used

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.810 align:middle line:10%
by a small number of people
in very tightly supervised

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:10%
and controlled situations.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I never approved
of what he did.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.391 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Aldous
Huxley actually tried

00:35:52.391 --> 00:35:54.300 align:middle line:90%
to persuade him not to do it.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Aldous said, look,
this is dangerous.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be careful.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And he said, the doctors--

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Osmond and Hoffer-- don't
think you should be doing.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.460 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't care.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of those
guys know about LSD.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> From Princeton, Humphry
Osmond joined the fight.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.400 align:middle line:84%
In a letter to
Leary, Osmond warned

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
against the
irresponsible use of LSD.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Your ventures have been
unnecessarily dangerous,

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:84%
both for yourself
and your colleagues.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It is like flying
without a mechanic

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.150 align:middle line:84%
to see that your
planes are safe.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.480 align:middle line:84%
No amount of brilliant
navigation and inspired courage

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.675 align:middle line:84%
will make much difference if
there is just one loose screw.

00:36:31.675 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Duncan Blewett did not share
Hoffer and Osmond's opinion

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:90%
of Leary.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Much as one can
decry Leary's methods,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.410 align:middle line:84%
certainly they
have been effective

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:51.490 align:middle line:84%
because, for instance, I saw
a cartoon in "Cavalier"--

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't usually read it--

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.174 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.174 --> 00:36:58.090 align:middle line:84%
national magazine-- and
the young man standing

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
in the street is talking
to a police uniform

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.470 align:middle line:84%
with a magnificent
sunflower on the head of it.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And he's saying, what?

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Me, officer?

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.790 align:middle line:90%
LSD, certainly not.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.390 align:middle line:90%
This kind of humor--

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.845 align:middle line:84%
and the one in "Playboy"
where the young couple--

00:37:12.845 --> 00:37:14.680 align:middle line:84%
they're unrolling their
Christmas presents

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and this young chap is
saying, good heavens, LSD,

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.991 align:middle line:90%
and we only sent them pot.

00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:23.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I think this indicates
the extent to which people

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that Leary was trying
to get in touch with

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.100 align:middle line:90%
were gotten in touch with.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> By 1966, LSD was given
blanket coverage in mainstream

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.920 align:middle line:90%
media.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Much of the programming
was aimed at youth.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm wondering if you could
tell me just whether there is

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.180 align:middle line:84%
a difference between
a black market LSD,

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.460 align:middle line:84%
the bathtub variety, and
the types of things used

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.850 align:middle line:84%
by yourself and others
in research experiments.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.800 align:middle line:90%
There is a major difference.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The pure LSD which we
obtained from Sandoz

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.700 align:middle line:84%
was a known chemical, whereas
the black market LSD contains

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:07.150 align:middle line:90%
only 10% of the original LSD.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's possible that many
of these so-called bad trips

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.060 align:middle line:84%
are due to the other
chemicals rather than

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.530 align:middle line:90%
to the LSD which they contain.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Bad trips experienced
as extreme fear, panic,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:26.475 align:middle line:84%
and even temporary psychosis
were now a common occurrence.

00:38:26.475 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:84%
The value of LSD as an agent
for gaining self-understanding

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.955 align:middle line:84%
and exploring higher states of
consciousness was being lost.

00:38:36.955 --> 00:38:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Medical doctors say you're
liable to go psychotic.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:50.600 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, I really think
this is a funny thing,

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:58.570 align:middle line:84%
but if all the people
that took acid--

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, the people that I
know that have taken acid,

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.470 align:middle line:84%
we can look out at the other
people that haven't and they

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.834 align:middle line:90%
can tell us we're crazy.

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can say, well, you
haven't seen anything yet.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> LSD was kindling a revolution
among the young of the West.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Controlled research
using the drug

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.705 align:middle line:84%
was about to be overtaken by
massive social and political

00:39:26.705 --> 00:39:27.505 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:39:27.505 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:84%
By the mid 1960s,
the war in Vietnam

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.140 align:middle line:84%
was being protested
by millions worldwide.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a tie in in
the United States between

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.640 align:middle line:84%
the anti-war Vietnam
War movement and the use

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelics.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The politicians
were saying, what

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.430 align:middle line:84%
is happening to
these young people?

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They're taking these drugs,
and they're becoming radicals.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:10%
They're trying to get our
troops out of Vietnam.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.320 align:middle line:10%
Heaven only knows
what will happen

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.425 align:middle line:10%
if we don't put the lid on LSD.

00:40:13.425 --> 00:40:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> They no longer believed what
their government was saying.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.030 align:middle line:90%
This is unique.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:10%
There aren't many
situations in human history

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:10%
where once a country is at
war, and the drums of war

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:10%
are sounding, that the
patriotic duty of the citizen

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:10%
is to rally around the flag
and my country, right or wrong,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.230 align:middle line:10%
but my country--

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:10%
well, that didn't happen.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:50.730 align:middle line:90%


00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Madness and anarchy confirmed
the establishment view that LSD

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.280 align:middle line:84%
was ravaging an entire
generation of youth.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I've known two people who
killed themself under LSD.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right out of control.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there acid parties going
on in this city right now?

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, at
this very second.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Abram Hoffer, knowing it
was just a matter of time until

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:20.660 align:middle line:84%
the door slammed shut on LSD,
proposed a radical solution

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:90%
to rampant street use.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't see why any reputable
person who wishes to explore it

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:30.230 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do so with the help
of a physician who could stand

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:84%
by in case you get
into difficulty.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be healthier then
to try and arrange places

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.335 align:middle line:84%
under proper supervision
where this could be done?

00:41:38.335 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Now I admit that it's not
going to happen tomorrow,

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe never, but I
think it would be better

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:45.890 align:middle line:84%
to try and achieve these
places than it would merit

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.390 align:middle line:84%
you to go out and
play with what you

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:90%
can get on the black market.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>> But it was too late.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The backlash by society
growing terrified of drugs

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:90%
was prevailing.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.690 align:middle line:84%
In March of 1966, Us
President Lyndon Johnson

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.552 align:middle line:90%
made possession of LSD a felony.

00:42:04.552 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:10%
In Canada, beginning
in the same year,

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:10%
a series of events
involving LSD were

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.140 align:middle line:10%
sensationalized by the media.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.910 align:middle line:10%
In November of 1966, on the
news magazine program "W5,"

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.315 align:middle line:10%
actress Pamela Hyatt was shown
undergoing therapy with LSD.

00:42:28.315 --> 00:42:31.957 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.957 --> 00:42:33.790 align:middle line:10%
>> A moment ago you
were saying you're ugly.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.110 align:middle line:84%
You weren't pretty enough,
pretty enough for father

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:36.910 align:middle line:90%
to love you.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:38.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:38.136 --> 00:42:41.394 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.394 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Pretty enough for
anybody else to love you.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.471 align:middle line:90%
I never felt I was.

00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:52.319 align:middle line:90%
I never felt I was.

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:57.140 align:middle line:90%
I never felt I was.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> On a Sunday night, Hyatt's
intense emotional experience

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.250 align:middle line:84%
was broadcast into millions
of homes nationwide,

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:84%
resulting in a
huge public outcry.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:84%
In February of 1967, opposition
leader John Diefenbaker

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.950 align:middle line:84%
brought the "W5"
program to the attention

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:90%
of the House of Commons.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.640 align:middle line:84%
To Diefenbaker, the broadcast
was a flagrant exploitation

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and encouragement of crime, and
called for government action.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.520 align:middle line:84%
In March of 1967, the
LSD-related suicide

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.350 align:middle line:84%
of a young man from Toronto
was carried by newspapers

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:36.150 align:middle line:90%
across the country.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.790 align:middle line:84%
One month later,
on April 23, 1967,

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
the Canadian
government introduced

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.190 align:middle line:90%
a bill that banned LSD.

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
All research projects by
the Saskatchewan group

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:90%
were immediately abandoned.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Although Hoffer,
Osmond, and Blewett

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.170 align:middle line:84%
were divided on how LSD
should be controlled,

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:13.600 align:middle line:84%
they were united in their
belief that the government

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.014 align:middle line:84%
ban on research was
unfounded and misguided.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Had it been possible
to avoid mass hysteria

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and to continue
responsible research,

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
important opportunities

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.600 align:middle line:84%
in the history of psychiatry
would not have been lost.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.670 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, to the individual,
if it's done properly,

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.730 align:middle line:84%
they develop insight into
their own personality.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.280 align:middle line:84%
They develop insight
to their own problems.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.546 align:middle line:84%
And they become more tolerant
of other people's experiences.

00:44:45.546 --> 00:44:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And they might even
be more productive.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:90%
They might be more creative.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:84%
For society at large, I think
we could always use ideas.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I think the more
we can encourage

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.950 align:middle line:84%
people to have useful ideas,
the better off we are.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a lot of people in
various places in society now

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:09.380 align:middle line:84%
who know that psychedelia is
not necessarily altogether

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:13.320 align:middle line:84%
damaging, that it, in fact,
changed the face of society,

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.490 align:middle line:84%
stopped the war in Vietnam,
prevented nuclear war,

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and had many, many
other effects,

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
one of which is now
evident everywhere.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.239 align:middle line:84%
It made people
question authority.

00:45:23.239 --> 00:45:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We have evidence that
psychedelics, properly used,

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.730 align:middle line:84%
can increase communication and
understanding between those who

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:90%
take them.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:44.320 align:middle line:84%
This has not yet been proved,
and proof is not easy.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize that
we are dealing with aspects

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of the human mind
that are even more

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:55.270 align:middle line:84%
elusive and mysterious than
the depths of space and time--
