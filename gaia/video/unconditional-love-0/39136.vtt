00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I am 36 years old and
I have cerebral palsy.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, I use my
computer to speak for me.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:84%
When I was born, the
doctors told my parents

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.430 align:middle line:90%
to put me in an institution.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I am lucky that my
parents did not do that,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
or I might not have been
able to be here today.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
This special bond
developed between Rick and I

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:84%
when Rick was first born, and
we started doing everything

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
together, and I think the bond
just got stronger and stronger,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:90%
as Rick grew and got older.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Boston is the only
marathon in the world

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
where you have to run a certain
time, depending on your age.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
They were using Rick's
age for us to qualify.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So that meant we had to run
under two hours and 50 minutes.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It was Rick that
got us into running.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be running
today, if Rick didn't ask me to.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
The Boston Marathon
is the one event that I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
look forward to all year long.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.025 align:middle line:84%
It is definitely
my favorite race.

00:01:43.025 --> 00:02:17.662 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The people along the
way are the best.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
They have such enthusiasm
that when my dad and I run by,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.213 align:middle line:84%
the adrenaline rush
is unbelievable.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Rick and I compete as a team.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I have no desire to go
out and run on my own.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel there isn't
anything that Rick and I

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
can't accomplish together.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.374 align:middle line:84%
Both Rick and Dick are such
an inspiration to this city,

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:17.286 align:middle line:84%
competing in their
18th marathon,

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:18.714 align:middle line:84%
together they have
proven that anything

00:03:18.714 --> 00:03:22.522 align:middle line:84%
is possible and achievable,
as long as you set mind to it.

00:03:22.522 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Rick is the athlete.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just out there, loaning
him my arms and my legs,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
so that he's able to
compete, like everybody else.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I am the body.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Rick is the hear.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:90%
And mobility is freedom.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:50.567 align:middle line:90%
