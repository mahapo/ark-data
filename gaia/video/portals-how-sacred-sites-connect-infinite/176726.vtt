In 2008, scientists at NASA made
an extraordinary announcement.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:84%
They discovered how
a network of portals

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
open every eight minutes,
linking the Earth to the sun.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The electron fusion
regions, or X points,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
are places where the Earth's
magnetic field connects

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, creating an
uninterrupted flow of particles

vast and sustained.

in one of India's

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
how this energy is also

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
could they be linked to places
where ancient architects

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
constructed extraordinary
temples where

imagine the portals discovered

they looked like an X.

a properly equipped

metaphors, particularly
the use of animal imagery,

And the art of temple
making, that is,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:10%
the concept of locating
an energy hotspot

and reinforcing it with
a sacred structure,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:10%
it appears to have migrated
westwards towards Europe.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the
dolmen for example,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that simple, harmonious
structure of balance stones

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:90%
ubiquitous throughout Europe.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Its earliest-known origins
lie in Japan and Korea.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Korean
peninsula is home

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to the greatest concentration of
dolmens anywhere in the world.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:10%
In Japan, it began
life as a gateway

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:10%
made from two wooden poles
connected by a rope stretched

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:10%
between them.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was called a torii.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And the rope was later replaced
by a wooden cross-piece

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:90%
extending beyond the poles.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the torii was
said to mark the gate

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:90%
to an abode of the gods.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And the more durable
version became the dolmen,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:90%
whose name comes from Korean.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Its approximate
translation is the stone

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
of the shaman, a shaman being
a mediator between what is seen

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and what is unseen.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And the point to remember here
is that in the old traditions,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
a god was not necessarily
an individual.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:90%
It was a force of nature.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:10%
So to connect with the gods was
to engage with elemental forces

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:10%
that make the universe tick.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And principal among
these forces is magnetism,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
which is concentrated at
megalithic structures,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
such as stone
circles and menhirs.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
In Scotland and
northern England,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
scientists studying
these sacred places

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
discovered that the

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.300 align:middle line:84%
of the geomagnetic field
within stone circles

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%

significantly lower than that

measured outside, as through
the stones act as a force field.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Scientists often
report tubes of light

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and other electromagnetic
phenomena interacting

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%

area of ancient temples

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
is the Morbihan region
of northwestern France.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Here lies the world's greatest
megalithic metropolis.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
In its heyday, it
resembled a forest of stone

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:84%
A survey conducted at the
end of the 19th century

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
revealed a concentration of
over 40,000 megaliths, mounds,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:84%
stone avenues, menhirs,
dolmens, and other sacred sites.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Yet this figure
only represents what

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
remains after centuries of
church-sponsored destruction,

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
which encouraged the systematic
wrecking of monuments

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and stones and temples and
their use as building material.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Entire villages were
constructed from the temples.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Many now lie beneath the
ocean or on islands cut off

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
from the mainland due to rising
sea levels by 1,000 years ago.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Around the village of Carnac,
one of four surviving avenues

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
consists of 4,000 stones
arranged in 13 parallel lines

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and up to a mile long.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
They begin and end in
egg-shaped stone circles

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and stand on deposits
of water, where

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:90%
the air is easily ionized.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:84%
The height of the stones
increases from two feet

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to as much as 13
the closer they get

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
to their respective circles.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:84%
What did ancient
architects have in mind?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>> An electrical engineer by
the name of Pierre Mereaux

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
conducted an exhaustive study
of the Carnac monuments.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:10%
And he found that every stone
serves a deliberate function

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:10%
in the processing of energy.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:10%
And his analysis shows how the
dolmens amplify and released

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:10%
telluric energy
throughout the day,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:10%
again with the strongest
readings occurring around dawn.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:10%
And the voltage and
magnetic variations

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:10%
that he measured actually
follow a scientific phenomenon

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:10%
known as electric induction.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So a dolmen behaves like
a coil or a solenoid

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:84%
in which the currents
are induced and provoked

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:84%
by variations of the
local magnetic field.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:10%
And yet these phenomena are
not produced with any intensity

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:10%
unless the stones are rich
in quartz, such as granite,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:10%
which, of course, they are.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.265 align:middle line:84%
And it helps explain
why the megaliths

00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:84%
were quarried and
transported from so far away.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
The readings he took
reveal an energy

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that pulsates at
regular intervals

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:84%
from around the
base of the stones.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And these pulses are both
positively and negatively

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:90%
charged.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So on paper, they actually
resemble the ripples in a pond,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
spreading out over 36 feet
away from the upright stones.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is when I would
turn the stones' aura.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So whereas you and I see the
physical boundary of the stone,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
its true size
energetically speaking

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:90%
is over four times in diameter.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But what Mereaux also found was
that these pulsations recycle

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:90%
approximately every 70 minutes.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:10%
And it demonstrates how the
stones and particularly the man

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.245 align:middle line:10%
menhirs charge and discharge
on a regular basis.

00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.800 align:middle line:84%
He also observed how the
stone circles concentrate

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:90%
energy like a condenser.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And the dolmens behave
like electrical coils.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But the best part of the story
is Mereaux was a skeptic.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:84%
He refused to believe that
any of these structures

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:90%
served any purpose whatsoever.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It was all pagan,
spiritual mumbo-jumbo.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:10%
But in the end, he proved
himself wrong and validated

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:10%
what we have known
all along, and that

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:10%
is that these monuments
give physical shape

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:10%
to this invisible energy that
not only flows along the Earth

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.705 align:middle line:10%
but also interacts with the
pulsating magnetic field out

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:44.505 align:middle line:10%
in space.

00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> As to the
placement of stones,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
the architects could have
made life easy for themselves

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
by erecting them beside the
quarry 60 miles from Carnac.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they chose
this exact location

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:84%
because it lies in
direct relationship

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to hotspots of
terrestrial magnetism.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
This is also referenced by the
direction in which the stones

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
are oriented, creating a
unique interface between Earth

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.035 align:middle line:90%
and sky--

00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:17.835 align:middle line:90%
a stargate.

00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Just to add another layer to
the energy connection between

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:10%
the site and the sky, these
structures were aligned

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:10%
to specific stars.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:10%
They even mirror
entire constellations.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:10%
The most well known, of course,
are the three Giza pyramids

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:10%
that mirror Orion on the
spring solstice in 10,500 BC.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Some are lesser known,
such as Kenko in Peru,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
whose megaliths are
deliberately placed.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Even the entire bedrock outcrop
has been shaped and angled

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:84%
so that Venus and
Sirius can be referenced

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
ascending the horizon at the
same time some 6,000 years ago.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:10%
So this created a direct visual
association with the temple,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:10%
and it served to attract
the perceived qualities

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:10%
of those sky objects so that
they in turn transferred

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:10%
their qualities to the temple
to the benefit of anyone who

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:10%
attended the sites at
certain times of the year.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And all this really
goes way above

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and beyond their supposed
function as mere calendars.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can
achieve the same effect

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:10%
by propping up a bunch of
sticks on your front lawn

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:10%
and marking the passage
of the sun and the moon.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:10%
These additional relationships
with their labor intensity

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:10%
and time consumption suggest
the link to far-away heavenly

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.110 align:middle line:10%
bodies was not just
a visual exercise.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:10%
There was also a
direct benefit to be

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:10%
gained from the interaction
between a person, the temple,

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.765 align:middle line:10%
and the star.

00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:90%

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:84%
A large-scale experiment to
prove ancient sacred sites

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
interact with subtle energy was
conducted in southern England

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
at the world's largest stone
circle, Avebury, as well as one

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:90%
of its most famous, Stonehenge.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Electrodes planted in and
around these henge monuments

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:84%
reveal how the ditches break the
transmission of tulluric ground

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
current and conducted
electricity into the ditch,

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:84%
concentrating it
and releasing it

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:84%
at the entrance to the
site at twice the rate

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:90%
of the surrounding land.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:84%
This led to the realization
that stone circles, even mounds

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:84%
like nearby Silbury
Hill, behaved

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:90%
like concentrators of energy.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Silbury is an artificial
mound constructed

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
on seven circular terraces
using alternating layers

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
of organic and inorganic
material, topped

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
with a slope of chalk, executed
precisely at 60 degrees.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
The nature of the
design allows it

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
to behave like a
natural battery,

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
soaking up the rising
electromagnetic energy

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:84%
generated by the action
of water percolating

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
through the porous
chalk soil below.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
The process is known to
science as adsorption.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:84%
A second vortex of energy
descends from the sky,

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
making this summit a
meeting place between mortal

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and divine, as anyone
who claims to the summit

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:90%
knows only too well.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:10%
>> There have been many
times when visitors,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:10%
including myself, have stood
on the summit and experienced

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:10%
the top half of the torso moving
one way and the lower half

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:10%
the other way, as though
reacting to two opposing

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:10%
vortices.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And it can be discombobulating
and hilarious at the same time.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.600 align:middle line:84%
But it only happens at
certain times of the month,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating how the
hill releases the energy

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:90%
at regular intervals.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:10%
And the phenomenon
is accompanied

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:10%
by the manifestation of a
whopping big ball of light

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:10%
that hovers above the summit
for around 20 seconds.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I've been very lucky
to see this on occasion,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and it is well known
to the local farmers.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.290 align:middle line:10%
This is one reason why the
genuine crop circles began

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:10%
to appear around the
periphery of Silbury

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:10%
Hill in the early 1980s,
not to be confused

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:10%
with the man-made nonsense that
came later to muddy the waters,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:10%
so to speak.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
analyzed by scientists,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:84%
it was found that these
imprints appeared precisely

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:84%
along Silbury's
energy field, the kind

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that Mereaux found circling
the stones of Carnac.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And the crop circles
also coincided

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
with the path of local
telluric currents that

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:90%
connect to the hill.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:10%
And more interestingly is how
some 80 people from around

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:10%
the world have witnessed
crop circles being

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:10%
made by a dissenting
vortex of light.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:10%
And I remember one
farmer back in 1965

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:10%
describing what he recalls
watching the rain bouncing off

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:10%
this electromagnetic tube.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And farmers don't
talk like that.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:10%
And we've also
collected hundreds

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:10%
upon hundreds of
reports from people

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:10%
who have experienced the very
same changes in consciousness

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:10%
often described in
ancient temples.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:10%
And a fair amount of these
people were skeptics--

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:10%
well, perhaps not so much now.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:10%
I actually undertook
a year-long experiment

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:10%
to map the energy field
radiating from a mound

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.210 align:middle line:10%
not far from Silbury.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:10%
And every two weeks,
I visited the site.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:10%
I measured the edge and
polarity of each ripple

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:10%
and then plotted all
of this on a computer.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And when assembled as
a time-lapse sequence,

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
you get this overhead view
of a man-made structure that

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:90%
appears to breathe in and out.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that you're
interacting with living energy,

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
with a living being, it really
does bring these static places

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
There is a reference to this
breath throughout the temples

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of Central America.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:10%
Palenque is a very good example.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Some pyramids and buildings are
marked with a T-shaped window

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
to define the space as
containing the breath of God.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:10%
And there's a transcendental
quality about these spaces,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:10%
more so than the
others, as they really

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:10%
are inside a hollow
tube stretching

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:10%
beyond the atmosphere.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:10%
And coincidentally,
they were often

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.050 align:middle line:10%
the very places that
were used for learning

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.247 align:middle line:10%
a type of restricted knowledge.

00:20:50.247 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> A mile to the north
of Silbury lies Avebury,

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:84%
a collection of two stone
circles inside a third massive

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:90%
ring of stones.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Surges in geomagnetic
energy have

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
been detected in the stones
of the two avenues leading

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
into the main stone
circle, suggesting

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that, in their complete form,
these winding causeways were

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
placed on or aligned with
areas rich in Earth energy,

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
which the stones conduct
into the center of the site,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
much in the same way
as they do in Carnac.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Inside this temple,
magnetic readings

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
drop at night to a
far greater level

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
than can be accounted for under
the natural circumstances.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:10%
At sunrise, they charge back,
with the telluric current

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:10%
from the surrounding land
attracted to the henge

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.615 align:middle line:10%
just as magnetic fluctuations
at the site reach their maximum.

00:21:52.615 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
This reveals inasmuch why temple
buildings regarded the temple

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
as a living organism that sleeps
at night and awakens at dawn.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the way in which
the stones are placed

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:90%
helps create this effect.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:10%
One ingredient for which
the stones of the temples

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:10%
were painstakingly
chosen is magnetized.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:10%
The stones are packed with it.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
scientists who took

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:10%
magnetic readings of
Avebury's remaining 67 stones

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:10%
discovered that the magnetic
south pole of each stone

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:10%
faces the next stone in line
as you walk towards the circle.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:10%
So this arrangement means that
the north poles of the stones

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:10%
oppose the local
geomagnetic field as though

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:10%
creating a conduit of energy.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:10%
Now, inside Avebury's two
smaller stone circles,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:10%
the south poles
of all the stones

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:10%
pointed at the next stone in the
circle in a clockwise direction

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:10%
with two exceptions.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:10%
The entrance stones have
their magnetic poles

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:10%
aligned at 90 degrees
to their companions.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:10%
So they align with the
stones of the avenue leading

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:10%
into the circle rather than with
those within the actual circle,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:10%
which begins to
make Avebury look

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:10%
like a group of aligned magnets.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, its
ancient designers

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:10%
were following
the same principle

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:10%
behind the modern
atomic particle

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:10%
collider, in which airborne ions
are steered in one direction.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps the most important
discovery at megalithic sites

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:84%
is the recurring mention
of how, just before dawn,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
an exterior force interacts
with the local electromagnetic

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
environment to create a link
between the temple and the sky.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:90%
It works like this.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Every morning, the
Earth is subjected

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.150 align:middle line:84%
to a rise in the solar wind,
which intensifies the planet's

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:90%
geomagnetic field.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:84%
At night, this field
weakens, then picks up

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:90%
at dawn and the cycle repeats.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
At this point, the
geomagnetic field

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.600 align:middle line:84%
interacts with
telluric currents,

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:84%
flowing along the
surface of the Earth.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:84%
This intensifies its energy,
which in turn is attracted

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:90%
to nearby sacred sites.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
These invisible
roads of force travel

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:84%
better along soil with a high
content of metal and water

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:90%
and probably quartz.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Where a boundary between two
different types of geology

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:84%
occurs, the telluric
current crossing it either

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:84%
reinforces or weakens
the daily fluctuations

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:90%
of the local geomagnetic field.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
This generates a
hotspot of energy

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
called a conductivity
discontinuity.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And even the ancient people
did not own state-of-the-art

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
diagnostic equipment, they were
able to locate such portals

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
long before science built
machines to prove them right.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.315 align:middle line:10%
>> The Sioux of North America
call this conductivity

00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:10%
discontinuity by a far
more memorable name.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:10%
They refer to it as scan.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:10%
And they say that when it
concentrates at power places,

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:10%
it influences the mind and
elevates personal power

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.180 align:middle line:10%
in the form of
spiritual attuning.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:10%
So in essence, the energy raises
the human body's resonance.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:10%
So when you visit and interact
with many places of power,

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:10%
the energy builds up inside you.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And this leads you to experience
a luminous state of mind.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.560 align:middle line:10%
You begin to feel
a transcendence.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.765 align:middle line:10%
You start to perceive
the other world

00:25:40.765 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:10%
and, under the right conditions,
in a very palpable way.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.931 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the oldest
spiritual practices

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:90%
comes from the Far East.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Tao, the way of the gods,
represents the underlying

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:90%
natural order of the universe.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Although its qualities
are ineffable,

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:84%
its energy is felt in
ancient sacred sites.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Practitioners of Tao
were teaching this

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:90%
over 5,000 years ago.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
They claimed that a proper
relationship with such places

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
awakens the greatest
human within.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:84%
This culturally shared belief
is what lies behind our need

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to go on pilgrimage.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.015 align:middle line:10%
>> Before we created man-made
temples to either enhance

00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:10%
or replace the natural
hotspots on the land,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:10%
ancient cultures located these
portals and marked them with

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:10%
petroglyphs.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And many of the symbols
are a kind of shorthand,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:84%
describing the journey of the
individual through the stargate

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and what he or
she learned during

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:90%
their out-of-body experience.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:10%
And often it would be a
cosmic truth or a revelation

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:10%
or a facet of the
mechanics of nature.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:10%
And these hotspots
would eventually

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:10%
be superimposed with
man-made structures

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:10%
so that when future
generations lost the connection

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:10%
to the natural
world and forgot how

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:10%
to access the portals
directly, they

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:10%
would know where to find them.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So the temples essentially
became self-help centers,

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:90%
precursors to the Samaritans.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you attend these
places, natural or man-made,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
you will notice how similar they
are in serenity and subtlety,

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:84%
because they are all
essentially the same X points.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:84%
They are all windows into
the soul of the universe.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:84%
the dragon or serpent,
one of the most culturally

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:90%
shared symbols on Earth.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It is my observation that the
natural force that these people

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:10%
were working with was meant
to be harnessed for all manner

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:10%
of beneficial purposes.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:84%
In the Far East, for example,
dragons were not slain.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:10%
Rather, their electrical power
was harnessed and maintained

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.287 align:middle line:10%
so it could be made useful.

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:11.120 align:middle line:10%
And this is one reason
why the dragon became

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:10%
the logo of temporal
power, assigned

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:10%
to a magician or a
sorcerer who in turn was

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:10%
called a son of heaven.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.500 align:middle line:10%
Only a dragon that
becomes unstable

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:10%
was considered
dangerous and needs

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:10%
to be subdued by pinning it
to the ground and transmuted.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are many images
of this Earth acupuncture

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:90%
throughout sacred art.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:10%
The emerging church in Europe
would take this benevolent idea

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:10%
and turn it into a symbol
of propaganda, which

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:10%
sent Michael killing
the dragon, which

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.300 align:middle line:10%
is meant to convey to
people of the Middle Ages

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:10%
the very clear message that
their old traditions were dead

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.880 align:middle line:10%
and their focus
should now be directed

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:10%
to the worship of this
new centralized religion,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:10%
much to our loss, because
this religion has nothing

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:10%
to do with connecting
with the creative force.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:10%
By its very nature
as a middleman,

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.450 align:middle line:10%
it serves to stop you
experiencing the divine.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
find the serpent carved

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:90%
on [INAUDIBLE] and other stones.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:10%
It demonstrates that the
megaliths mark, anchor,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:10%
and harness the energy already
present at that location

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:10%
and makes it
available to anyone.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.760 align:middle line:10%
It's probably the
only type of snake

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:10%
I've ever learned to like.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There are places on the lands
where the veil between worlds

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.270 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit thinner.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions describe
them as resident places

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of the spirits, what
Western scholars interpreted

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:90%
to be gods.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They are repositories of
energy, power places that

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:84%
help enlighten the
individual by providing

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:56.460 align:middle line:84%
a more direct connection with
an astral reference library.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But they can also be used to
store and send information.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of the most lucid
descriptions of working with

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:07.790 align:middle line:10%
Earth energy comes from
aboriginal tribes living among

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:10%
featureless terrain, who are
able to find their way around

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.390 align:middle line:10%
by sensing what they
call [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:90%
an invisible line of force.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So when a tribesperson walks
across such a spirit road,

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:84%
they will hear the
resonance imprinted

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.997 align:middle line:90%
by those who walked before.

00:30:25.997 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:10%
So in a way, the
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] behave

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:10%
like strips of magnetic tape,
recording the song of every

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:10%
individual.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And these dreaming
tracks are imprinted

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:84%
with a permanent
record of events.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.910 align:middle line:10%
And it enables the aborigine
to walk enormous distances

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:10%
while listening
to a data stream.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:10%
And just like modern-day
cloud computing,

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:10%
the information can be
accessed on demand--

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:10%
if you know how.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.940 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
lead to spiritually important

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
locations, despite each one
being physically separated

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
by hundreds of miles
of featureless desert.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:84%
During a study, it was
found that when these spirit

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.230 align:middle line:84%
roads are used to
figure out directions

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:84%
to non-sacred places, the margin
of error is as high as 67%.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But when using them to walk
from sacred site to sacred site,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:90%
the error is less than 3%.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The magician shaman of the
aborigine have long used such

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
energy pathways to
locate the portals.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And standing in these
invisible doorways,

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
they're able to transmit
information telepathically,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:84%
which is then
received as an image

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.750 align:middle line:84%
by another shaman sitting
in a similar portal

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:90%
some distance away.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.877 align:middle line:84%
Why waste money on
a cell phone plan

00:31:45.877 --> 00:31:47.710 align:middle line:84%
when you can use this
subtle energy at will?

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient cultures describe
portals as increase centers.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And the use of correct
ritual inside them

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
elicits a life force
that intensifies

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:90%
the vitality of people.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, the same
stargates are called baraka,

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:84%
while the Hopi call them
the spots of the fawn.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:84%
In New Mexico, the
Tewa people still

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:21.600 align:middle line:84%
work with this energy on
the sacred hill, Tsikumu.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.900 align:middle line:84%
They call it powaha,
which they say provides

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:90%
a portal to the other world.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Is this why some mountains
became more sacred than others?

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:10%
>> When you listen to A-type,
He-Man mountain climbers

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:10%
talking in very spiritual
terms about a sudden experience

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.070 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of a climb, it
really pays to listen to what

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:10%
they're saying.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
favorite stories is

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.875 align:middle line:84%
by Maurice Herzog when he
was climbing the Annapurna,

00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:90%
the holy mountain in Nepal.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I had the strangest
the most vivid impressions

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.390 align:middle line:84%
such as I had never
known in the mountains.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.550 align:middle line:84%
All sense of exertion
was gone, as though there

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:90%
was no longer any gravity.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen such
complete transparency,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and I was living in
a world of crystal.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Sounds were indistinct.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere was
like cotton wall.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
There was an enormous gulf
between me and the world.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:90%
This was a different universe.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:90%
We were overstepping a boundary.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.350 align:middle line:10%
It's wonderful, isn't it?

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:10%
What many climbers
are not aware of

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.650 align:middle line:10%
is that these hotspots of
these specific mountains

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.530 align:middle line:10%
also happened to be
geomagnetic hotspots.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> This explains why so many
mountain temples and shrines

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.350 align:middle line:84%
are placed in irrational and
frankly dangerous locations.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:51.550 align:middle line:84%
They represent the X that marks
the spot, a portal to a much

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:52.887 align:middle line:90%
higher frequency.

00:33:52.887 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The two most prominent
geomagnetic hotspots

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:10%
in Portugal just happen to
coincide with the region's two

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.800 align:middle line:10%
most sacred mountains, as
well as its oldest and most

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.469 align:middle line:10%
concentrated
[INAUDIBLE] centers.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And these are in Monsanto,
literally sacred mountain,

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and Sintra, which is named
for the Phoenician goddess

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And here you will
come across the most

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:10%
wondrous and remote temples.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:10%
There are hermit caves,
megaliths, even rock-cut tombs,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.540 align:middle line:10%
which are far too shallow
to bury a dead body but very

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:10%
practical for temporary
shamanic travel,

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.690 align:middle line:10%
no doubt assisted by the
fact that the stone happens

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:10%
to be ever-so-slightly
radioactive, naturally

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.115 align:middle line:10%
so, which actually
helps the process.

00:34:40.115 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Then there are those sacred
mountains that require no

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:84%
man-made enhancements, their
energy being palpable even

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.429 align:middle line:90%
to the casual observer.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:57.610 align:middle line:10%
They are living portals whose
energy remains unadulterated.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.470 align:middle line:10%
Not surprisingly,
they also happen

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:10%
to be the focal point of
entire spiritual cultures

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:10%
along with myths describing them
as locations where knowledge

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.840 align:middle line:10%
and laws are delivered
from gods and star-walkers

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:10%
to mortals, places like
[INAUDIBLE],, Mount Fuji,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:24.060 align:middle line:10%
Arunachala, and Kura Tawhiti.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:10%
>> If we take the concept
of portals a stage further

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:10%
and examine the relationship
between a landscape temple,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:10%
such as a sacred mountain, and
the magnetic tubes of energy

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:10%
discovered by NASA, it is
interesting to note that

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.420 align:middle line:10%
in the mystical traditions
of Persia, Japan,

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:10%
and the lands of the Hopi,
such locations are described

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:10%
as meeting places
between heaven and Earth,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:10%
and not because a mountain
is closer to the stars,

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:10%
which may seem obvious.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:10%
Each of these cultures
describes the exact location

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:10%
of the sacred cave or the
shrine or the ritual center

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.960 align:middle line:10%
on a sacred mountain as
being connected to the sky

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:10%
by a luminous tube
or a hollow reed,

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.710 align:middle line:10%
along which the spirit of
the initiate travels outward,

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:10%
but also the energy
of the gods descends.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that our
predecessors already

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.290 align:middle line:84%
understood how those
magnetic tubes reach

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
through the atmosphere
and touch the Earth

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.916 align:middle line:90%
at specific locations.

00:36:23.916 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:10%
And they took advantage of
these terrestrial X points

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.690 align:middle line:10%
to go traveling among
the stars for free.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:84%
They were thousands
of years ahead

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.140 align:middle line:90%
of the very latest technology.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is this energy
fundamental to places of power?

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.240 align:middle line:10%
Probably because they were
designed with humans in mind.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The human body is
now widely accepted

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:84%
as being made from the
very same stuff, a walking

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.850 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
edifice, sensitive

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:58.830 align:middle line:84%
to minute fluctuations in
the local geomagnetic field.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:84%
With electromagnetism
playing such a pivotal role

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.540 align:middle line:84%
in the temple, its influence
on the body and its 72% water

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:84%
content is immediate, not
to mention human bone,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.450 align:middle line:84%
with all its silica, through
which electrical current flows.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Even DNA receives
information from changes

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:84%
in the local electromagnetic
environments.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It can be argued that
the temple isn't only

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.380 align:middle line:90%
a mirror of the heavens.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It's made of all the elements
that make us who we are.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:35.560 align:middle line:84%
They are a mirror of
us, a perfect one.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Because the blood that
flows through our veins carries

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:10%
a fair amount of iron, magnetism
will work on it like a magnet

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.210 align:middle line:10%
reorganizes iron filings
on a sheet of paper.

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.280 align:middle line:10%
And the same is
true for the brain.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.470 align:middle line:10%
There are substantial
amounts of magnetite

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:10%
found in brain tissue
and the cerebral cortex.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:10%
Under the right conditions,
magnetic stimulations

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.960 align:middle line:10%
of the brain induces
dreamlike states,

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.900 align:middle line:10%
even in waking consciousness.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:10%
So think about this whenever you
walk around the megalithic site

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:10.890 align:middle line:10%
with all of those stones
filled with all that magnetite.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Then there's the effect
that telluric forces in temples

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.360 align:middle line:90%
exert on the pineal gland.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Fluctuations in the
geomagnetic field

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.950 align:middle line:84%
affect the production
of chemicals

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:84%
made by the pineal, such as
pinoline, which interacts

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:84%
with another neurochemical
in the brain,

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:33.490 align:middle line:84%
serotonin, the end result
being the creation of DMT,

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:38.310 align:middle line:84%
a hallucinogen that allows
information to be received.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.550 align:middle line:84%
In an environment where
geomagnetic field intensity

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.670 align:middle line:84%
is decreased, people
are known to experience

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:90%
psychic and shamanic states.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the reasons why
man-made temples were placed

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:54.170 align:middle line:84%
on natural portals
and why anyone would

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.420 align:middle line:90%
wish to interact with them.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:01.396 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.396 --> 00:39:05.878 align:middle line:90%
[WATER LAPPING]

00:39:05.878 --> 00:39:08.069 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:10%
>> It is said that there
is nothing like personal

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.340 align:middle line:10%
experience, and I totally agree.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.810 align:middle line:10%
And all of this research makes
for great television and books,

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:10%
and yet when I began
interacting and studying

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:10%
ancient places decades
ago, I had no idea just how

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:10%
powerful the interaction
is between you, the portal,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:10%
and just how far your
consciousness can travel,

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.480 align:middle line:10%
not to mention the
quantity of information one

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.060 align:middle line:10%
is able to retrieve.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on what
it is you're asking.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:10%
So in my case, I tend
to use the opportunity

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:42.040 align:middle line:10%
to ask for better guidance
on the purpose of a temple

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.820 align:middle line:10%
so I can then be a
better teacher to others.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:10%
And 99 times out of 100
when I follow what I'm given

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:52.440 align:middle line:10%
and research it, the information
turns out to be spot on.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.540 align:middle line:10%
It makes writing books
that little bit easier.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.540 align:middle line:84%
One experience I remember
was at Sacsayhuaman in Peru.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.790 align:middle line:84%
One is somehow lost for
words describing this place,

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.350 align:middle line:90%
but there's a specific hotspot--

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I remember
calling it a portal stone

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:90%
the first time I ever saw it.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was from the
top of the opposite hill.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a massive stone
with such presence.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.750 align:middle line:10%
And you feel pulled towards
it as though you're flowing

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:10%
along a fast-moving current.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And the effect is
twice as intense

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.480 align:middle line:10%
standing in front of it.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:10%
And there's one video
where I'm trying to explain

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.490 align:middle line:10%
this temple to a group.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's quite
obvious I'm struggling

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.410 align:middle line:10%
to maintain my focus, as though
someone is actually speaking

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:39.300 align:middle line:10%
to me when I'm talking.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was precisely
what was happening.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I can hear information
being given to me

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:90%
about the site in my head.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.980 align:middle line:10%
And meanwhile, I'm struggling
to remember all of this

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.940 align:middle line:10%
while I'm having a
conversation with my group.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Somehow I was able
to write this down.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I wrote down all that I heard.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And after a month
of research, I was

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
able to prove this
original information.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinary,
which is just as well,

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.420 align:middle line:90%
because I thought I'd gone mad.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:10%
And it happens in many sacred
places and particularly

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:13.650 align:middle line:10%
megalithic sites, as it
does to any number of people

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:17.404 align:middle line:10%
I know who follow a similar
passion for this kind of work.

00:41:17.404 --> 00:41:21.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:90%


00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I find the temples of the Andes
to be very potent stargates,

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.870 align:middle line:84%
sometimes even more so
than those of, say, Egypt.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a focus about them, a
connection with another stream

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.600 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's very intense.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.740 align:middle line:10%
And often it brings
into sharp focus

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.740 align:middle line:10%
all you've learned
about such places.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was at
another amazing site called

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Amaru Meru which in the
local Aymara language

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:84%
means "the gateway of the
gods" and literally looks

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:59.920 align:middle line:84%
like a big T-shaped door,
the breath of God once again.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:10%
It felt very different
to previous visits.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:10%
And when I press my forehead
to one section of the temple,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.550 align:middle line:10%
I could clearly see
this bright, red tube

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:14.110 align:middle line:10%
coming into my forehead
head-on like a glowing beam,

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:10%
but only at that exact spot.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:10%
And curiously, there
are many stories

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:10%
of locals witnessing the portal
glowing blue, with people

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.560 align:middle line:10%
dressed in unusual clothing
appearing from within

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.390 align:middle line:10%
and other people disappearing
into the doorway.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And as a stargate,
it is beautifully

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.710 align:middle line:10%
aligned to the rising of
Venus before the sunrise

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:10%
on the spring equinox.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:44.490 align:middle line:84%
By contrast, the stone
circles of Callanish

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:48.860 align:middle line:84%
on the remote island of Lewis in
Scotland are a gentler energy.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.920 align:middle line:90%
The stone is very different.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Many of the sites have
been aligned to the moon.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So by nature, these power
places are more subtle.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.240 align:middle line:10%
They are places for
introspection and dreaming,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.840 align:middle line:10%
but to this same end,
information is also retrieved.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.775 align:middle line:84%
But you also get to do
a lot of personal work.

00:43:05.775 --> 00:43:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:14.130 align:middle line:10%
My time inside the Great Pyramid
of Giza, different yet again.

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:18.850 align:middle line:84%
This place is really intense,
not everybody's cup of tea.

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.210 align:middle line:10%
And twice now, I've
seen people dressed

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.750 align:middle line:10%
in what appeared to be
white satin gowns coming out

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:25.950 align:middle line:10%
of the stones.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:29.190 align:middle line:10%
And once this was done
in total darkness.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Another time it was
in minimal lighting

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.320 align:middle line:84%
while conducting a
ritual for a group.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing about
the second experience

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.760 align:middle line:84%
is how a good number
of those people

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.840 align:middle line:84%
also picked up on these beings
without any prompting from me.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:50.130 align:middle line:10%
But for sheer raw power, there
are several natural portals

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:10%
that really define for me what
this energy really is about,

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.900 align:middle line:10%
how it interacts with the
land and what it does to you

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.060 align:middle line:10%
and where it takes you.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.840 align:middle line:10%
There's Shiprock, or Tse
Bit'a'i, in the Four Corners

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.280 align:middle line:10%
region of the Native American
Southwest, very potent,

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.180 align:middle line:10%
so clean you can hear people
dancing in ceremony all around

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.090 align:middle line:10%
you.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:10%
It's entrancing.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.880 align:middle line:10%
Your sense of temporal space
evaporates really quickly.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.280 align:middle line:10%
It's about as humbling an
experience as I've ever had.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.050 align:middle line:10%
There's one site in
Wales, the Cadair Idris,

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:32.340 align:middle line:10%
which means the seat of Enoch,
which Gaelic myths declare

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.180 align:middle line:10%
to be the main portal into the
other world in this region.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.650 align:middle line:84%
There are many
mountains in Wales,

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.750 align:middle line:84%
but this one feels
as though you're

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.200 align:middle line:90%
stepping across a threshold.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And another one is actually on
the opposite side of the world.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It's called Kura Tawhiti on the
South Island of New Zealand.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And getting there is
just a journey in itself.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you allow
yourself to merge

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:59.610 align:middle line:84%
with this beautiful
landscape, the spirit of place

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.220 align:middle line:90%
is very clear.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.270 align:middle line:10%
And I recall in
my first visit how

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.720 align:middle line:10%
I saw what resembled a
large screen descending

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:10%
in front of me.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.260 align:middle line:10%
And it was revealing
what the landscape looked

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.760 align:middle line:10%
like over 11,000 years ago and
some aspects of the knowledge

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.530 align:middle line:10%
that was actually taught there.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So no wonder the original
people of this particular part

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.530 align:middle line:84%
of the world, who are
called the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.680 align:middle line:84%
they refer to this place as
the birthplace of the gods.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.440 align:middle line:10%
And they were
themselves following

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.060 align:middle line:10%
in the footsteps of people whom
they refer to as star walkers.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.660 align:middle line:10%
So this natural temple
is their ancient academy.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a repository of the
knowledge of the gods

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:42.669 align:middle line:84%
and the jumping-off
place to the stars.

00:45:42.669 --> 00:45:44.460 align:middle line:10%
And being there, you
can really believe it,

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:49.590 align:middle line:10%
because you can actually see it,
if you get out of your own way

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:10%
and discard all of
those silly limitations

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.260 align:middle line:10%
that the modern world
tries to impose on you.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:58.050 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The X point between astral
and terrestrial energies alone

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.860 align:middle line:90%
does not make a place sacred.

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:09.050 align:middle line:84%
A stargate becomes sacred when
it energizes within us feelings

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and concepts we associate
with the spiritual dimensions

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.570 align:middle line:84%
This perceptual reality,
experienced and reinforced

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:84%
by people over
long spans of time,

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.380 align:middle line:90%
marks the portal as sacred.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.780 align:middle line:84%
When churches were
built across Europe,

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.690 align:middle line:84%
their focal point, the
altar, was typically

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:84%
built above an ancient
sacred site and specifically

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:84%
its most concentrated
spot of energy.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:84%
In Old English, altar used
to be spelled with an E,

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and together with its
Latin root altare,

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:48.410 align:middle line:84%
identifies the location as
both a high place and a place

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:52.925 align:middle line:84%
of altering, which begs
the question, who or what

00:46:52.925 --> 00:46:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is being altered, and which high
place are they transported to?

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.690 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1980s, Princeton
Engineering Anomalies Research

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Department decided to find out.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:09.650 align:middle line:10%
>> After rigorous experiments
using direct human thought

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:10%
to influence the random
movement of objects,

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:10%
even alter the beat of
a computerized drumbeat,

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.770 align:middle line:10%
with incredible
results I should add,

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.320 align:middle line:10%
this small team at
Princeton decided to take

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.640 align:middle line:10%
their investigation
a stage further.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was
to give validation

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.850 align:middle line:10%
to that gray area with
science and mysticism overlap.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And one experiment
concerned the measurement

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.960 align:middle line:84%
of data collected by
an electronic device

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.940 align:middle line:84%
called a Random Event
Generator, REG for short.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And the REG was first used
for the global consciousness

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:84%
project, in which the
machine revealed spikes

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.820 align:middle line:84%
in collective
human consciousness

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:53.480 align:middle line:84%
prior to major events, such
as the catastrophic tsunami

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.830 align:middle line:90%
in Indonesia.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, the team
found consistent deviations

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:84%
from expected
randomosity in data

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:06.470 align:middle line:84%
taken in situations where groups
became unified by something

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:08.530 align:middle line:90%
of common interest.

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:11.480 align:middle line:10%
And the evidence demonstrated
that a consciousness field

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.800 align:middle line:10%
exists and that intentions
or emotional states which

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.450 align:middle line:10%
structure this field can
be detected by the REG.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.970 align:middle line:90%


00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.940 align:middle line:10%
At this point, the team
began conducting experiments

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.210 align:middle line:10%
at sacred sites, because the
scientists were intrigued

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:32.270 align:middle line:10%
as to whether the
sacredness of these places

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.180 align:middle line:10%
was due to their
collective views over time

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.720 align:middle line:10%
or because they were imbued with
a certain energetic resonance

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.080 align:middle line:10%
in the first place or because
a combination of forces

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.770 align:middle line:10%
such as stone and
electromagnetism and so forth

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:46.580 align:middle line:10%
made them so.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.350 align:middle line:84%
During an initial experiment at
the Native American landscape

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:57.410 align:middle line:84%
temple called Mato
Tipila in Wyoming,

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.290 align:middle line:84%
the REG's output
was demonstrably

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:04.670 align:middle line:84%
affected by a
medicine man ceremony.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And the team then decided to
see what effect meditation

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.360 align:middle line:84%
groups would have on
the output of the REG

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
when chanting or meditating
at interesting sites which

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.750 align:middle line:90%
were not necessarily sacred.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Now this time, the
machine was only

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:21.710 align:middle line:84%
influenced to a small
statistical degree.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.570 align:middle line:90%


00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Then they went to Egypt
and conducted experiments

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:90%
at 27 temples.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And what astonished
Princeton's team leader

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:84%
was that the results were
even higher whenever he walked

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.670 align:middle line:84%
around the site in
respectful silence

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:43.300 align:middle line:84%
with a portable version of the
machine sitting in his pocket.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So for him, it proved that
the spirit of place by itself

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.940 align:middle line:84%
registered effects as high
as the power emanating

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.340 align:middle line:90%
from a meditating group.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But while the
temples by themselves

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.720 align:middle line:84%
resonated a higher
degree of consciousness,

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:02.520 align:middle line:84%
the combination of focus group
meditation plus the temple

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.710 align:middle line:84%
created an expanded
consciousness,

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.400 align:middle line:84%
whose effects were six
times that of ordinary REG

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.350 align:middle line:90%
trials in the field.

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:15.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they represented the
highest effects ever seen.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
crux of the matter.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.970 align:middle line:84%
When the human temple interacts
with the stone temple,

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
consciousness expands beyond
the limits of this Earth plane

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.560 align:middle line:90%
and reaches another planet.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.140 align:middle line:90%


00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We are now discovering why
temples are described as places

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.990 align:middle line:84%
where a person can be
transformed into a god,

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.100 align:middle line:90%
into a bright star.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:46.230 align:middle line:10%
Many traditions describe groups
of ancient architects embarking

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.050 align:middle line:10%
on a temple-building
program across the world

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:52.530 align:middle line:10%
at carefully-chosen locations.

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Now we know what this means.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.620 align:middle line:84%
These unusual people
possessed practical knowledge

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of the laws of nature, and
they apply this ability

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.760 align:middle line:84%
in the service of humanity
by creating umbilical cords

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:84%
upon the face of the Earth
that stretch deep into space.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.400 align:middle line:90%


00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.770 align:middle line:84%
These power places
represent some

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:84%
of the most awe-inspiring
structures, many of which

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
have survived some
11,000 years, thanks

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to a persistent
rebuilding program.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the builders
meant for these stargates

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to survive for
posterity, perhaps so

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that the principles upon which
the structures were founded

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.850 align:middle line:84%
would serve future
generations to reacquaint them

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:40.500 align:middle line:84%
with a connection
they'd forgotten.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Each portal is a contact
station with the miraculous,

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.870 align:middle line:84%
an island of balance
on a planet where

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:51.000 align:middle line:90%
change is the only constant.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Every stargate behaves
as a self-help center,

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:59.350 align:middle line:84%
especially during times of chaos
when people lose their rudder

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and their antenna
no longer tunes

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:05.600 align:middle line:90%
in to a clear, spiritual signal.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a wonderful
inscription written

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:11.530 align:middle line:84%
on the walls of the Temple of
Edfu describing the temple,

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "as a magical
protector for you in heaven

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and in Earth, unfailingly
and regularly and eternally."

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And they are absolutely right.

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.590 align:middle line:84%
However, no matter
how much magic

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.930 align:middle line:84%
there may be in these
places, the temple

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:31.020 align:middle line:84%
does not exist as a
vending machine dispensing

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.350 align:middle line:90%
instant self-empowerment.

Like any functional
partnership, you

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:38.220 align:middle line:10%
have to offer a little
bit of yourself.

Meet the temple
half way and then be

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:44.250 align:middle line:10%
careful what you ask for,
because you might just

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.450 align:middle line:10%
receive it.
