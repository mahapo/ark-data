>>Newspapers talked about it.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:90%
People wanted to know.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But nobody could
penetrate the mystery.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Strange flying machines were
flying the skies of Italy.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:90%
It was the '50s.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Some people took
incredible photos.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Others were frightened
and shouted, they're here.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
They're among us.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
While still others believed
the aliens had come to help.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:90%
But who were they?

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Where were they from?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Above all, what did they want?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Many knew but kept
quiet, a mystery that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
has remained as
such for decades,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
a secret now
revealed-- Friendship,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
the incredible story of
mass contact between humans

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.542 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials.

Until recently, the
phenomenon of contactism,

or the deliberate encounter
repeated over time between man

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:10%
and evolved
extraterrestrial entities,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:10%
was believed to involve only
a few chosen individuals

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:10%
or contactees.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Many of them went down in
history-- George Adamski,

Howard Menger, Eugenio
Siragusa, just to name a few.

All of them faithfully
abided by this cliche.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But in 2007, something
happened that would

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:90%
change the cards on the table.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Stefano Breccia, an engineer
from Marche living in Abruzzo,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
published some
startling papers that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
seemed to reveal the story
of repeated direct encounters

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
between more than 100 people and
extraterrestrial beings living

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.342 align:middle line:84%
in numerous secret
bases on our planet.

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The main figure of the event
told by Breccia is the writer

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Bruno Sammaccicia .

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The case is said to
have taken place mainly

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:90%
in and around Pescara.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It would all begin in 1956
and would last for many years.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
The film clips and photographs
that have emerged so far

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:90%
are of considerable interest.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But even more extraordinary
are the testimonies

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:90%
of the individuals involved.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Everyone called their
story Friendship.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is the name that
has come down to us today.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to Stefano
Breccia's courage,

sagas in ufology

has come to light.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't an easy decision
to decide to make it known.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:10%
It all started from an
idea by Bruno Sammaccicia .

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
He'd been thinking about
writing down his experiences

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and then asked me to
be the one to do it.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I was at his house for
a month to record his stories.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Then I put everything together.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Besides granting his
dear friend's wishes,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Breccia had set himself
another objective.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>One reason is to
hope that it might

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
work as bait to encourage
other people in the group

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
to come forward.

who were involved in
the Friendship events

and who accepted Breccia's
invitation to come forward.

They now live on the
shores of Lake Como.

Gaspare admired
Stefano's courage

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:84%
to expose himself so
directly, despite being

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.556 align:middle line:84%

Sammaccicia called the beings

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:90%
by the name of W56.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
They weren't a single
race but a group

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial beings
coming from different parts

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.522 align:middle line:84%
Although they
looked like humans,

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
there were considerable
differences

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
in height, which ranged
from 1 to 6 meters.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
The first encounter took
place in April 1956.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Bruno Sammaccicia was there,
along with his two friends,

this parchment because
Bruno collected antiques.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.735 align:middle line:10%
And while looking
at it, they noticed

00:06:22.735 --> 00:06:25.235 align:middle line:10%
it was a map of the castle above
Ascoli Piceno at Rocca Pia.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be a
kind of treasure map.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to go and
take a look at the area.

in particular until
one night when

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:10%
they came across these people.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
these two came out

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
from a path that runs
around the castle,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
introduced themselves,
and started to talk.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
One of them was particularly
short, about 1 meter in height,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and the other, extremely
tall, 2.5 meters,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:84%
As for the rest, they
looked like normal people.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>But what happened
in that encounter?

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
According to the
eyewitnesses, the two aliens

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:90%
spoke perfect Italian.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
immediately struck them

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:84%
was the strong
sense of love that

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:90%
emanated from these beings.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
The information they gave to
Bruno, Giancarlo, and Julio

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:90%
was awesome to say the least.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:84%
They said that Earth had been
created for a positive purpose

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and that man was turning
everything into evil,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that the morality
level of humans

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:90%
was much lower than their own.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:10%
They explained that this
is a very critical moment

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:10%
in human history.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Atomic weapons are
capable of destroying

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:84%
the planet in a matter of
minutes, a tremendous risk that

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
could come to pass because
of our low moral sense.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Their task was to ensure that
the situation didn't get out

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:90%
of hand.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They said they weren't here to
conquer, as there was nothing

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to conquer, that everything
stemmed from the need

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
for love and respect,
and that everything

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:90%
should be done in accordance.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
They knew Earth's history,
philosophies, and religions

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.660 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
They said they'd already been
on Earth for many centuries,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:84%
living at secret bases in
various places on the planet.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
They preferred not to
reveal themselves publicly

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
because people weren't
ready for the contact.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
They expected a positive
return from their activity.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
Their goodness and their
truth would be stronger

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.030 align:middle line:90%
than human doubts.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
When they left, it was
almost 3:00 in the morning.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary
experience of Friendship

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
began at that very moment.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
The meetings between Bruno,
Giancarlo, Julio, and the W56,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
also known as the Friends,
continued for several months.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
During frequent long walks
on the beach in Pescara,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:84%
they gave the humans a good
deal of other information.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Dimpietro was the
name of the captain

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:84%

in contact with the continental
shelf, which roughly ranged

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:10%
from Fortuna to Rimini, as
the expanse of its longitude,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:10%

the middle of the Adriatic

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:10%
to the Apennines, with an
upper limit of 300 meters,

so vast that it was
affected by normal weather.

So at times it
also rained inside.

Then they had many smaller
bases, closer to the surface.

But through a
particular mechanism,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:84%
they were able to compress
material laterally.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
The soil would thicken
into what would later

become the walls of the place.

And then the outer
structure was formed

by extremely dense and therefore
extremely strong material.

it was very unstable.

They usually explained that a
team of professional workers

would be coming soon to transfer
the goods by other means.

driver to some nearby bar

to wait for the phantom
workers, Giancarlo

met were chosen in advance.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Ethics permeated everything
about them to the point

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.680 align:middle line:90%
that they would refuse.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, they said
that if they weren't

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
able to avoid harming
someone, then in that case

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:90%
they would self-destruct.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>It wasn't by chance that
the journalist Bruno Ghibaudi

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.230 align:middle line:84%
was with De Lama and Sammaccicia
during the sighting published

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:90%
by "Domenica del Corriere."

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Ghibaudi was extremely
involved in Friendship

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and experienced everything
there was to be tried,

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:59.380 align:middle line:84%
including the personal
encounters with the W56.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Stefano Breccia also knew him.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.690 align:middle line:84%
He remembers very well
how he joined the group.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>At the time, Ghibaudi
had a program on television

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:90%
about making model aircraft.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Giancarlo had seen it by chance.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And he liked this person.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.580 align:middle line:84%
He asked for Bruno's
permission, and Bruno agreed.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
As a result, Ghibaudi was
brought to Milan to meet Bruno

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and starting from then also
became part of the circle.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>The presence of the
journalist was important

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
because he could
indirectly publicize

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the information that
was given by the Friends.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:10%
>>He was a journalist
who could help the case

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.490 align:middle line:10%
by writing about
it, while we didn't

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:47.237 align:middle line:10%
have any connections like this.

00:37:47.237 --> 00:37:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.010 align:middle line:84%
He had acquaintances
in the field

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.410 align:middle line:84%
of journalism and television
that we didn't have.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>The pictures that
Ghibaudi took of a UFO

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.600 align:middle line:84%
over Monte Mario in Rome
attracted the attention

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:90%
of Cesare de Sabatini.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The famous filmmaker
interviewed him

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and put the piece in a
documentary film entitled

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.780 align:middle line:90%
"The Mysteries of Rome."

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The words of Ghibaudi
emphasized what the W56 had said

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
was one of their main tasks
on our planet, the control

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
of the nuclear
armaments belonging

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to the superpowers in
the fear that men might

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.620 align:middle line:84%
make the terrible
choice of using them,

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:90%
unleashing a total war.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is one of the
key themes of the entire story

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.060 align:middle line:90%
of worldwide contactism.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.872 align:middle line:84%
Adamski, Siragusa, Menger,
and many other contactees

00:38:38.872 --> 00:38:41.246 align:middle line:84%
received the same kind of
message from extraterrestrials.

00:38:41.246 --> 00:38:43.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And the W56 actually
intervened with their UFOs

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and their technology but
with previously trained

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.730 align:middle line:84%
terrestrial operators
to stop a situation that

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:84%
seemed it might lead to
something irreparable.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:90%
The incident occurred in 1967.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:10%
>>So an operation,
managed by human beings,

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:10%
was launched, which was designed
to disable all nuclear warheads

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:10%
in the Soviet Union and
in the United States

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:10%
in the face of a situation
that seemed risky

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:10%
that might degenerate from
one minute to the next.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:27.940 align:middle line:84%
There are books written by
officers of the US Air Force,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.530 align:middle line:84%
by now retired, which
tell the story of how

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.270 align:middle line:84%
their battery of
Minuteman missiles

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:38.690 align:middle line:84%
had been rendered inactive
by flying saucers revolved

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the books referred
to by engineer Breccia

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:84%
was written by Robert
Silas and James Klotz.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
It contains military
documents obtained

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.470 align:middle line:84%
through the law on the
Freedom of Information,

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:55.860 align:middle line:84%
the so-called Freedom
of Information Act.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are other clues about
the interest these beings had

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.350 align:middle line:90%
in nuclear weapons.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:84%
The atomic tests have always
been filmed and photographed

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:84%
with special equipment,
with technologies

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that can capture the very first
moments of the thermonuclear

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.580 align:middle line:90%
explosion.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.940 align:middle line:84%
In these pictures,
we see the explosion

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.140 align:middle line:84%
in the first few microseconds,
when the terrible mushroom

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:90%
cloud hasn't yet formed.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.670 align:middle line:84%
In the third snapshot,
we note the presence

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
of an Adamskian flying saucer a
few meters from the explosion.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:10%
If authentic, this
photo would give us

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.260 align:middle line:10%
an idea of the incredible
technological capabilities

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.610 align:middle line:10%
of these creatures.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Another extremely
important person

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.540 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
Italian ufology

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:42.340 align:middle line:84%
was Consul Alberto Perego, who
wrote as many as four books

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:84%
between the '60s and '70s
analyzing the world scene

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and pointing out policy choices
made by governments that

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.180 align:middle line:84%
would have been affected by
the overt or covert activities

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.860 align:middle line:90%
of this sort of alien aviation.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Many exceptionally
clear photos of UFOs

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.400 align:middle line:90%
appeared in these volumes.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
even identified

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.930 align:middle line:84%
as being the inside of a
cockpit of a flying saucer.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Perego cited the dates and
locations of the sightings

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.780 align:middle line:84%
but never mentioned the name
of the authors of the photos.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The places were almost
always the classic zones

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:84%
where the W56 and the Friendship
were active-- Milan, Pescara,

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Francavilla, Montesilvano.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the photos
were made precisely

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:28.120 align:middle line:84%
by the people who were
part of Friendship.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But we've only
learned this today.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:84%
For Gaspare De
Lama, Alberto Perego

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.590 align:middle line:90%
was of paramount importance.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.020 align:middle line:10%
Perego introduced him
to the comprehension

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:10%
of the profound implications
of the UFO phenomenon

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.910 align:middle line:10%
and contactism at
a time when it was

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.010 align:middle line:10%
extremely difficult
to find material

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.080 align:middle line:10%
about these issues in Italian.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>And then he told me how
things were, according to him.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, I reeled
a bit of the chair

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't expect it.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:90%
He really knew.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he'd understood a lot.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:84%
He'd understood-- a man of great
valor, an idealist, a pure man.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.180 align:middle line:84%
He too was amazing,
very cultured.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>Perego also
announced to Gaspare

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:84%
that he intended to publish
a book where he would reveal

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.520 align:middle line:84%
everything he knew about the
presence in our midst of beings

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.390 align:middle line:84%
from other worlds, a proposal
that never materialized,

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:90%
however.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Among the correspondence
that Gaspare has kept

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.250 align:middle line:84%
are letters written by
Consul Perego himself.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:84%
In one of these,
among other things,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.400 align:middle line:84%
he talks about his intention
to publish the book

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.390 align:middle line:90%
"I'll Tell All."

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Other statements made in this
excerpt of the letter also

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:90%
very interesting.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:10%
>>"Dear, I imagine you've
guessed my bitter experience

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.590 align:middle line:10%
of recent years.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.670 align:middle line:84%
For the revelation
of the new reality,

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd bet on two men who have
disappeared from the scene--

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:90%
John XXIII and Kennedy.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:02.570 align:middle line:84%
As is well known,
Kennedy died five days

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:06.280 align:middle line:84%
before my 'Report'
went into circulation.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:11.620 align:middle line:84%
As you've seen, everyone keeps
quiet or pretends not to know.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:16.690 align:middle line:10%
In 1965, I hope to
publish 'I'll Tell All.'

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.160 align:middle line:10%
But I believe I've
already said a good deal.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending you with best
wishes, a most affectionate

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.120 align:middle line:90%
remembrance.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Alberto Perego."

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>But the alleged tasks
of these creatures

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.160 align:middle line:90%
would have been others as well.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Another purpose of the
presence of the W56

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.420 align:middle line:84%
was to help our
evolutionary process,

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.130 align:middle line:84%
to push us to a higher
level of understanding.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why they had been on
our planet for a very long time

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and even shared with us some
of our suffering in the matter.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:84%
They also revealed that
their real name was "Akrij."

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Stefano Breccia has done
research on this name,

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.685 align:middle line:84%
discovering some very
interesting aspects.

00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>The word Akrij is a
plural noun in Sanskrit

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.020 align:middle line:90%
that means "the sages."

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I tried
to see it in Egyptian.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that there
are two very similar words.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:10%
The first term,
Akrij, is the name

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.240 align:middle line:10%
of these divinities,
which usually

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.840 align:middle line:10%
means "the wise people."

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.760 align:middle line:10%
Then it occurred to me to
inquire into other languages.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
in classical Greek,

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Akril means 'Akeo,' or
"people in high places."

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.120 align:middle line:84%
