00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> This is magnetite, one of
the most magnetic substances

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.340 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.610 align:middle line:84%
As you can probably guess, it
has a diverse range of uses,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
from fridge magnets to
generating electricity

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.010 align:middle line:90%
in power plants.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But what you probably
wouldn't guess

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.512 align:middle line:84%
is that your brain actually
synthesizes these crystals,

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have hundreds
of millions of them

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.260 align:middle line:90%
inside your head.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are still
unsure what role, if any,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
these crystals play in
the brain's function.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Studies have inferred
that it may play

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:90%
a role in long-term memory.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
In animals, like honeybees,
homing pigeons, and dolphins,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
magnetite is believed to be
associated with the ability

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
to navigate based on the
Earth's magnetic field.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
While similar studies have
yet to be performed on humans,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%
we do know that
Earth's magnetic fields

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
affect everything from our
mood to our ability to learn.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:10%
Even stranger,
research has begun

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:10%
to prove links between
the electromagnetic field

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.380 align:middle line:10%
of our planet and
psychic abilities.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Do these crystals act like tiny
antennas connecting our brains

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
to each other and to
the entire planet?

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It may sound far fetched,
but, surprisingly, there

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:90%
is evidence.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what we know about
the magnetite in our brains.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, we
don't know much.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
In 1992, the first evidence
of this mineral in the brain

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:90%
was published.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:10%
It was shocking to
uncover that this highly

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:10%
magnetic substance was actually
synthesized by our bodies.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And while we don't know
exactly what function it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
plays in brain activity,
some interesting theories

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
have emerged.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
A 2009 hypothesis
proposed that magnetite

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
plays a significant role
in long term memory.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:10%
It suggests that cellular
components of the brain

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:10%
communicate with each other
through magnetic signals,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:10%
with the magnetite particles
acting as tiny antennas,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously
receiving information

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:10%
throughout the different
parts of the brain.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:10%
Magnetite also
acts as an antenna

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:10%
for external
electromagnetic fields,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:10%
including the geomagnetic
field of the Earth itself,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:10%
and this is where things
start to get interesting.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
An enormous body of
research is emerging

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that shows substantive links
between magnetic fields

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:90%
and cognitive function.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:10%
Back in 1978, research
physicist Dr. Robert C Beck

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:10%
published preliminary
research on the effects

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.950 align:middle line:10%
of extremely low
frequency magnetic fields

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:10%
on the moods of human subjects.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
ELF fields of 6.67 hertz,
6.26 hertz, and lower

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:84%
tend to produce symptoms of
confusion, anxiety, depression,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
tension, fear, mild
nausea, and headaches.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
fields of 7.8, 8.0,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and 9.00 hertz produce
anxiety-relieving

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:90%
and stress-reducing effects.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:10%
They even mimic some
meditative states.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
More recently,
magnetic fields have

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
been used in successful
clinical practices

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
for eliminating depression
and bipolar disorder,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
with over 1,300 medical research
papers published to date.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
The noninvasive treatment known
as repetitive transcranial

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
magnetic stimulation
uses a wand-shaped gadget

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
to zap away the
effects of depression.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:10%
While all of this is
interesting and can

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:10%
pave the way for new
therapies and treatments,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:10%
a group of researchers at
Canada's Laurentian University

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:10%
are exploring the role of
electromagnetic forces in more

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:10%
extreme cognitive functions.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:10%
This is Dr. Michael Persinger,
a neuroscientist who

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:10%
has argued that all phenomena,
including consciousness,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:10%
spiritual experiences, and
even paranormal events,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:10%
can be explained by
physical mechanisms,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:10%
and they can be verified
using the scientific method.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:10%
Since 1971, he has
been researching

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic field effects
upon biological organisms,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:10%
and some of his
recent studies sound

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.696 align:middle line:10%
straight out of a sci-fi movie.

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Persinger has
shown in the laboratory

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
that magnetic brain stimulation
can create mental states

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:90%
conducive to human telepathy.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:10%
A recent experiment placed
two people at a distance

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:10%
in different rooms.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Each was surrounded by an
identical computer-controlled

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:10%
magnetic field.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
When a light was flashed
in one subject's eye,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
the person in the other room
showed responses in their brain

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
as if they saw the
flash of light.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Persinger
stated, we think

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that's tremendous because
it may be the first macro

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
demonstration of a
quantum connection,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
or so-called quantum
entanglement.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.730 align:middle line:84%
If true, then there's another
way of potential communication

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that may have physical
applications, for example,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:90%
in space travel.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
On a much larger
scale, correlation

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
has been shown between
the geomagnetic forces

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and a
variety of effects

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:90%
spanning large populations.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:10%
A 2003 study found
strong empirical support

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:10%
in favor of a geomagnetic
storm effect in stock returns

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:10%
and evidence of substantially
higher returns around the world

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.490 align:middle line:10%
during periods of quiet
geomagnetic activity.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Other research has linked
geomagnetic activity

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
to suicide, heart disease,
and even birth rates.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
A particularly
curious global effect

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is related to a standing
electromagnetic wave

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that exists between the Earth's
surface and the ionosphere.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.500 align:middle line:10%
Known as the Schumann
Resonance, this wave

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:10%
has a frequency of 7.8
hertz and is frequently

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:10%
referenced in alternative
theories of consciousness.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Measurements by
Doctor Persinger have

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
shown that the fundamental
and harmonics of the Schumann

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
resonance were discernible in
normal human brain activity,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, they correspond to
Dr. Beck's anxiety-reducing ELF

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Stranger still was Persinger's
study of the remote viewer Ingo

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Swann.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing
refers to a technique

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%
used by psychic spies
working for the CIA.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
see far off locations

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
as if they were there, and they
could even move through time.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Ingo Swann was one of the
first and most accurate viewers

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:90%
in this program.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
When Doctor Persinger
measured his brain's

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic activity
during viewing sessions,

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
he found a spike in
activity at 7 Hertz

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
which correlated with the
most accurate viewings.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that Swann was able
to project his consciousness

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
by tuning into a standing
geomagnetic wave of the earth?

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:84%
All of this adds up to
a fascinating connection

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
between our brains and the
shared magnetic field, not only

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
of our planet, but potentially
of the entire universe.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.650 align:middle line:84%
It's undeniable that the brain
responds to magnetic forces

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.892 align:middle line:90%
on a local and a global scale.

00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
While no one has
been able to prove

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:84%
the involvement of magnetite,
it seems a likely suspect.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
If we learn to harness the
power of these tiny antennas

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
in our brain, who knows what
kind of psychic superpowers

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:90%
we might unlock.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:90%
