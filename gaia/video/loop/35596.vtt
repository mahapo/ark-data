00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:12.738
♫ You made me love you

2
00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:17.486
♫ I didn't wanna do it

3
00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:22.007
♫ I didn't wanna do it

4
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:27.007
♫ You made me want you

5
00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:32.467
♫ And all the time you knew it

6
00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:36.877
♫ I guess you always knew it

7
00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:41.877
♫ You made me happy sometimes ♫

8
00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Voiceover>I have to go.</v>

9
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.206
My train leaves at 9:45.

10
00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:47.687
<v Voiceover>I know.</v>

11
00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:51.897
Thank you for taking care of me, Rose.

12
00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:53.626
<v Voiceover>I love you, Mother.</v>

13
00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:58.215
<v Voiceover>I love you too.</v>

14
00:00:58.215 --> 00:00:58.925
Please, be careful.

15
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:03.925
You know I worry about you, all alone in New York.

16
00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:06.003
<v Voiceover>Oh, I'll be fine, mother.</v>

17
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:11.003
Things are just starting to fall in place.

18
00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:15.966
(intensifying cymbols)

19
00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:21.747
<v ->Don't say it.</v>

20
00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:24.466
<v ->I wasn't gonna say anything.</v>

21
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.566
I just think--

22
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.427
<v ->Rose... don't.</v>

23
00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:29.927
<v ->Don't what?</v>

24
00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:31.516
Say it's ironic?

25
00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.743
I can't think of a better example of the word I mean,

26
00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:37.604
here we are, celebrating our 50th anniversary,

27
00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:42.064
we're driving along, and we hit a pot hole.

28
00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:46.664
<v ->I'm gonna go check the tire.</v>

29
00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:51.664
(suspenseful music)

30
00:02:03.343 --> 00:02:05.564
I don't have another spare.

31
00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:09.845
<v ->Most cars only have the one.</v>

32
00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:14.845
<v ->Ok, no more wise cracks.</v>

33
00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:16.576
I'm gonna have to call Information

34
00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:19.156
to find the nearest garage.

35
00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:20.437
<v ->Ok, dear.</v>

36
00:02:20.437 --> 00:02:22.776
And while you get this all figured out,

37
00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:27.776
I'm going across the street to see if we ever get home.

38
00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:32.416
<v ->A psychic?</v>

39
00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:34.617
<v ->Well, it's better than waiting a lifetime</v>

40
00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:37.336
for a tow truck to arrive.

41
00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:38.436
<v ->Just don't be too long.</v>

42
00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:39.817
I don't wanna have to come in there and get ya.

43
00:02:39.817 --> 00:02:41.097
You know I don't like psychics.

44
00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:43.136
<v ->Oh, it's all in good fun.</v>

45
00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:46.556
I'll have her, or him, get a reading on you.

46
00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:47.978
<v ->Just leave me out of it.</v>

47
00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:52.248
<v ->'fraid I can't do that, dear.</v>

48
00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:59.978
(eerie droning)

49
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.118
<v ->Hello, welcome.</v>

50
00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:21.579
<v ->Oh, hello.</v>

51
00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.919
You're not quite what I expected.

52
00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.879
<v ->I get that a lot.</v>

53
00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.059
My name is Laura.

54
00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:31.189
Come on in.

55
00:03:34.578 --> 00:03:36.979
<v ->You probably already know my name.</v>

56
00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.979
<v ->Yes, Roxy. I've been expecting you.</v>

57
00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.339
<v ->Roxy? My name...</v>

58
00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.780
Well, once upon a time, I did go by Roxy,

59
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.242
but, that was a life time ago.

60
00:03:50.242 --> 00:03:52.960
That was my stage name.

61
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.301
I was a nightclub singer in New York City.

62
00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:59.721
I was just a young girl, only 21.

63
00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:02.340
I was quite good actually.

64
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.237
Anyway, I get a call from my mother,

65
00:04:04.237 --> 00:04:05.956
she's gonna have surgery,

66
00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:07.734
of course, I rush home.

67
00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:09.854
She comes through it fine.

68
00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:14.634
I stay few weeks, and then I'm due back in New York.

69
00:04:14.634 --> 00:04:17.334
Well, I'm driving my mother's car,

70
00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:19.094
to pick up my friend Rita,

71
00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:22.234
so she can drive it back from the train station,

72
00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:25.174
and wouldn't you know it, I drive over a pot hole,

73
00:04:25.174 --> 00:04:27.152
and get a flat tire.

74
00:04:27.152 --> 00:04:28.752
<v ->Ironic.</v>

75
00:04:28.752 --> 00:04:31.313
<v ->Don't let my husband hear you say that.</v>

76
00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.488
<v ->Don't worry I won't.</v>

77
00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:34.824
Please, go on.

78
00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:37.844
<v ->Well, I don't know the first thing about changing tires,</v>

79
00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:42.140
so I waited, probably 20 minutes or so.

80
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.681
Finally, a young man comes along and offers

81
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:47.811
to change the tire.

82
00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:49.336
To make a long story short,

83
00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:52.377
he was very charming,

84
00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:54.816
and he asked me to stay one more day

85
00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:57.456
so he could take me to dinner.

86
00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:59.916
And I did.

87
00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:04.517
That one day turned into fifty years.

88
00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:06.857
I never looked back,

89
00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:11.857
and I've had a wonderful life with a wonderful man.

90
00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:14.874
I'm just curious.

91
00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:16.775
What would my life have been like if I

92
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.497
made it back to New York that day?

93
00:05:19.497 --> 00:05:21.258
<v ->Hmm.</v>

94
00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:24.578
So, the loop is nearly complete.

95
00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:26.058
<v ->Excuse me?</v>

96
00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:29.017
<v ->Don't worry, you'll know in time.</v>

97
00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:32.297
If you had stayed in the city, hmm?

98
00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:37.127
Give me your hands.

99
00:05:37.127 --> 00:05:42.067
(eerie music)

100
00:05:59.597 --> 00:06:04.158
There's a night club.

101
00:06:04.158 --> 00:06:06.618
You're the headliner.

102
00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:11.318
Oh, you look radiant.

103
00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:14.859
There's a song.

104
00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:17.679
(gasp) You're a beautiful singer.

105
00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:22.679
You're very happy.

106
00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:28.540
Time passes.

107
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.300
Your success in the city is growing.

108
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.521
In fact, you're on the verge of becoming a star.

109
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:40.521
You're on the stage, and a young man enters the club.

110
00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:44.593
Catches your eye.

111
00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:47.937
He buys you a drink.

112
00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:52.398
You're in love.

113
00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:56.096
There's a wedding.

114
00:06:57.946 --> 00:07:02.180
You buy a beautful apartment in the city.

115
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.350
And,

116
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.030
you have your own tv show.

117
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:12.421
Now, you are a star.

118
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:28.201
<v ->Hey, thanks for coming.</v>

119
00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:29.962
<v ->Not a problem, I just need to see your AAA card.</v>

120
00:07:29.962 --> 00:07:33.325
<v ->Oh, yeah, sure.</v>

121
00:07:35.714 --> 00:07:36.774
<v ->That's your family?</v>

122
00:07:36.774 --> 00:07:37.715
<v ->Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:39.215
My three boys and their wives,

124
00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:41.994
and all 12 of my grandchildren.

125
00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.995
That's Paul, the oldest.

126
00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:48.885
And Joseph, I named him after me.

127
00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.592
<v ->You're having a baby.</v>

128
00:07:56.592 --> 00:08:00.482
and then another.

129
00:08:01.293 --> 00:08:03.970
More time passes.

130
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.930
Your children are having children.

131
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.689
Your star has long since faded,

132
00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:14.535
but, you are happy.

133
00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:21.238
(eerie music)

134
00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:27.364
It's been 50 years.

135
00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:32.046
So many grandchildren.

136
00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:37.595
Your boys offer to pay for a trip away,

137
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:41.591
and your husband insists on driving.

138
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:42.077
<v ->Alright.</v>

139
00:08:42.077 --> 00:08:43.957
I've patched the hole. It should last until you get home.

140
00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:46.816
Just be sure you dont run over any more pot holes.

141
00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:50.266
<v ->Thanks, how much do I owe you?</v>

142
00:08:51.937 --> 00:08:55.687
<v ->And you ask me...</v>

143
00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:05.777
<v ->I know dear, I've seen it all.</v>

144
00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:08.186
Thank you.

145
00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:19.016
Then you know she's alread paid for this session.

146
00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:27.237
<v ->Just got it fixed.</v>

147
00:09:27.237 --> 00:09:30.696
We'll be on our way shortly.

148
00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:35.127
Love you too, bye.

149
00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:45.496
(uplifting music)

150
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.030
What was that for?

151
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.930
<v ->I love you.</v>

152
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.620
<v ->I love you too, Rose.</v>

153
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.888
You ok?

154
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.868
<v ->Never better.</v>

155
00:10:40.868 --> 00:10:44.658
<v ->Let's get on the road then.</v>

156
00:10:46.728 --> 00:10:51.728
(uplifting music)

157
00:10:57.909 --> 00:11:02.649
So, what'd the psychic say?

158
00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:06.389
<v ->Nothing I didn't already know.</v>

159
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:07.810
<v ->Shall we go then?</v>

160
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.169
<v ->Yes, we shall.</v>

161
00:11:11.169 --> 00:11:12.779
<v ->Which way?</v>

162
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.910
<v ->You know, Joe?</v>

163
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.029
We're already on the right road.

164
00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:23.559
Just keep going down this way.

165
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.170
