00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.930 align:middle line:10%
>> To me, "Mona Lisa"
makes me feel Leonardo da

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.840 align:middle line:10%
Vinci's passion for
his dream woman,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:10%
the perfect woman
that he imagined.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.750 align:middle line:10%
And he may have had an
affair with this woman.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was so in love with her
that he painted this picture.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And he carried it around
with him everywhere he went.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And he probably had
conversations with his picture.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think the "Mona Lisa"
is da Vinci's real doll.

00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:10%
>> So the "Mona Lisa for me
is a painting that captures

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:10%
the enigma of femininity, of
what women have, their power.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:10%
And I believe she
was a woman who was

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:10%
married to a wealthy merchant.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Elizabeth.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And she probably had to fill
certain roles in her life.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:84%
She probably didn't
have a lot of freedoms

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:84%
to pursue her own
dreams or visions.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But yet she still
had this wisdom

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and this innate
feminine power that you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:90%
can feel through the painting.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And for me, every time
I see that painting,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.767 align:middle line:84%
it inspires me to feel the
woman behind the painting.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm actually an art teacher.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have that
painting in my classroom

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
so all my students
can see that painting.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And we talk about it.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a painting that
Leonardo da Vinci was really

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:90%
attached to.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And he carried it around
with him for years

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
until he sold it to, I
believe, Francis I in 1508.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great
painting by the man

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
I consider to be the greatest
genius who ever lived.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And it has undefinable powers.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.024 align:middle line:90%
And it's a painting about women.

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And Leonardo didn't really
know how to connect with women,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.481 align:middle line:84%
I think, on a really
emotional or physical level,

00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:03.008 align:middle line:84%
but yet he captured the beauty
of women through that piece.

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.494 align:middle line:90%

00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:10%
>> To ask someone what they
think of the "Mona Lisa,"

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:10%
looking at the painting, someone
who've never ever heard of it,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:10%
because what I think they'd
say is it's another painting

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:10%
of a pretty woman.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful painting.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's a
whole stigma about it

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
because Leonardo da
Vinci painted it,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
about Leonardo da Vinci,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and the things that he
did, and these drawings

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of the helicopters,
and his inventions,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:90%
or an amazing man he was.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think therefore people
have taken the "Mona Lisa"

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and made it out to be
something really amazing.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And therefore more people
think it's amazing.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:90%
And they've never even seen it.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You mention the "Mona
Lisa" to someone

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.849 align:middle line:84%
and they go, oh, yeah,
that's that amazing painting.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I bet if you asked
half the people have

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
you seen the painting,
they'd probably say no.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.652 align:middle line:84%
So there is an interesting
thing being built up around it.

00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The Mona Lisa would find
herself amidst the most

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
dangerous nuclear threat in
the history of the world.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
While the United
States began the lead

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
in nuclear weapons testing with
numerous explosions ranging

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:84%
toward 20 megatons,
Russia had tested

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
the largest nuclear
weapon in history

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
at 50 megatons on
October 31, 1961.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:10%
On October 22, 1962,
President John F. Kennedy

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:10%
alarmed the world media
that the Soviet Union

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:10%
was building secret missile
bases in Cuba, dangerously

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:10%
close to the state of Florida
and within striking distance

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:10%
of most major American cities.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:84%
This set off national panic
that the United States

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
was at the brink of a
nuclear war with Russia.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
It was clear Russia
was ready to go to war.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:84%
The United States
was very tense.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
President Kennedy skillfully
avoided the nuclear conflict

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
with Russia despite
pressure from US generals

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:90%
who wanted a war.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:10%
On November 21,
1962, Russia agreed

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:10%
to withdraw its nuclear bombers
and 40,000 Russian troops

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:10%
from Cuba.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
At this time, First lady Jackie
Kennedy had arranged with

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
the French government's cultural
minister AndrÃ© Malraux to have

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
the "Mona Lisa" visit the
United States of America.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
To do this, the "Mona Lisa"
would be transported from Paris

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to New York by ocean
liner in December 1962,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
only days after the Russian
nuclear climate was cooling.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Kennedy was obsessed
with the "Mona Lisa."

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and yet she would risk
moving it across the Atlantic

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
with a chance of a
possible flare up

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
amongst the danger
of Russian vessels.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Did Jackie Kennedy
use the "Mona Lisa"

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to tame the tension
in the Atlantic,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
knowing the Russians wouldn't
dare strike while the "Mona

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Lisa" was being transported,
or was her cause

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
a gamble for the
people's morale?

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, "Mona
Lisa" prevailed

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:84%
on what seems her first
global peace mission.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:10%
On January 8, 1963,
the "Mona Lisa" exhibit

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:10%
opening at the
National Gallery of Art

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:10%
was in concert with the opening
session of the 88th Congress.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
"Mona Lisa" was in attendance
of the entire House

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
of Representatives, the Senate,
the Kennedy administration,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and the Supreme Court.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
A Washington
newspaper commented,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:84%
"Seldom in the history of
the United States of America

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
has the ruling
class been present

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.505 align:middle line:90%
in such overwhelming numbers."

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. Minister, we in the
United States are grateful

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:84%
for this loan from the leading
artistic power in the world,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:90%
France.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:84%
In view of the recent
meeting at Nassau,

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I must know further
that this painting has

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
been kept under
careful French control

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and that France
has even sent along

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
its own commander-in-chief,
Monsieur Malraux.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:10%
And I want to make it
clear that, grateful as we

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:10%
are for this painting, we
will continue to press ahead

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:10%
with the effort to develop
an independent artistic force

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:10%
and power of our own.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> "Mona Lisa" was secured
by military guard and viewed

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
by tens of thousands of
Americans for only a few

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:90%
seconds each.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:84%
As each person gazes at the
"Mona Lisa" throughout history,

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
they take with them their own
mystical experience of her.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I love the "Mona Lisa"
because she's got a secret.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:10%
And I know what it is.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:10%
But I'm not telling either.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I would say that she
is very mysterious and I like

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:10%
that.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:10%
But I like to believe that
she's very self-confident,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:10%
and assured, and somebody that
comes from her own inner voice,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:10%
like my serenity sisters,
that she listens to her inner

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:10%
dictates instead of
what's politically correct

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:10%
or whatever seems to
be end of the day.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So she's just a real serene,
but mysterious, amused,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:90%
happy female that I really like.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Leonardo da Vinci
was born on April 15,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:84%
1452 in a small village called
Vinci near Florence, Italy.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
His father was Piero
da Vinci and his mother

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:90%
a peasant girl named Catarina.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci was not
only a master painter.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
He was a scientist, an engineer,
inventor, biologist, musician,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:90%
writer, and mathematician.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:10%
While many scholars
do not believe

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:10%
he encrypted his art
with hidden messages,

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:10%
the "Mona Lisa's"
dimensions reveal

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:10%
the truth once and for all.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:10%
Mona Lisa is 77
by 53 centimeters.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
If we divide 77 centimeters
by 53, we get 1.4528301887.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We can clearly see that
the first digits, 1.452,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.290 align:middle line:84%
is the year that
Leonardo da Vinci was

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:84%
born, proving that
the masterpiece is

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:90%
coded with deeper meaning.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
What else is hidden
in the Mona Lisa?

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The issue of divine
providence is challenged

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:10%
by the early explorers
of astronomy.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Providence means that
the church actually

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
believed that all of the
bishops and the popes

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
were receiving their all
knowingness, their omniscience

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:90%
from God.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were God's
authority on Earth.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
In the first and second
councils of Nicaea,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
the idea was that providence was
present in the decision making

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
process to isolate the four
gospels, Matthew, Mark,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Luke, and John.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of the other
manuscripts that

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
were submitted in the
council were rejected by God,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
because God's providence
was present in the council.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most Christians
believe this today.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
But I believe, having
studied da Vinci,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that he was a rebel, that
he took the position, as I

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:84%
do, of the anti-Nicaean fathers,
the fathers of the church that

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
were against the decision making
process to reject literally

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds of
manuscripts that may have been

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:90%
the true words of Jesus Christ.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:10%
But later, the church
actually believed

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:10%
that, even scientifically,
it possessed this providence

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:54.040 align:middle line:10%
that God's divine providence was
present in the all-knowingness

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.050 align:middle line:10%
of science in the universe.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:10%
The early church
adhered to the idea

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.060 align:middle line:10%
of Ptolemy's geocentric
view of the universe

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:10%
that the Earth was the
center of the universe

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:10%
and that the sun revolved
around the Earth.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:10%
I discovered, from
studying da Vinci's notes,

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:10%
that da Vinci may have
been the first person

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:10%
to actually secretly disclose
that the Earth was revolving

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:10%
around the sun, which
is the heliocentric view

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:10%
that later evolves.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Now Copernicus, the
Polish astronomer,

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:90%
actually believed this.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he comes just a
little bit after Vinci.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're both
alive at the same time.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:90%
They're contemporaries.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
It's possible they might
have even exchanged ideas.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But Copernicus waits until
he's nearing his death

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to disclose the truth that
actually the Earth is not

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:84%
the center of the universe
and the church was wrong.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:90%
And there was no Providence.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
God was not present in its
all-knowingness in the bishops

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and the pope in the
scientific authority of God

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and the universe.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what happens
later is Galileo

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:84%
adopts the same
ideas of Copernicus

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth is actually
revolving around the sun.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Once per year, the Earth
makes a solar orbit.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And later, of course,
as astronomy evolved,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
we realized that
all the nine planets

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
are revolving around the
sun as a solar system.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And the solar system
is oscillating

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
around the galaxy every
250 million years.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So there are orbits within
orbits within orbits.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.629 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
you have Hubble

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
has now discovered there
are hundreds of millions

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of galaxies in the universe.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And galaxies are far bigger
than the ancients ever

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:90%
believed the universe could be.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't even
conceive of a galaxy

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:90%
in the time of even da Vinci.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But looking at da
Vinci's notes, why did he

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
fear revealing what he
knew that the Earth was

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:90%
revolving around the sun?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:10%
The reason he didn't
disclose it is

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:10%
because the Inquisition's
wrath was so powerful

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:10%
that if anybody challenged
the church's position

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:10%
on the geocentric view,
they could face imprisonment

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:10%
and even death.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And Galileo is the proof.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Galileo is the first one
whose courage comes forth.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:10%
And he publicly states,
being the first astronomer

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:10%
to look at the universe with
telescopes, that the church is

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:10%
wrong, that there is
no divine providence,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:10%
that, scientifically, it becomes
proven, just like we discovered

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:10%
the Earth is not
flat, it's round,

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:10%
now we discover that the Earth
is revolving around the sun.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:10%
So what this means is da Vinci
may have been one of the first

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:10%
to know this before
Copernicus and before Galileo.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:90%
But he kept it secret.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So what other
secrets did he keep?

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:90%
What did he know?

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
How much did da
Vinci really know?

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, clearly, he was that,
and what I think as a young

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:10%
person what inspired me
most about Leonardo was his

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:10%
diversity, is that he
was really diverse.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:10%
And he was very close to nature
and influenced by nature.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:10%
And in much of my work,
I'm influenced by nature.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:84%
There is a crossover
between the human condition

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and civilization in nature
and how those interact.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why I studied a lot
of Leonardo's nature drawings

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and water drawings, how
he captured movement.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's clearly an
observer of the world.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, there again reflecting
back to the "Mona Lisa,"

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:90%
she's observing the world.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
She's very clearly
observing the world.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
No matter where you stand and
look at her, she's observing.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In the case of the
"Mona Lisa," I mean,

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I literally know
nothing about art.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally, I
am not an art scholar.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
to me on November

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the 11th was that,
mysteriously, this woman

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in this deep sapphire robe
appears at the foot of my bed

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And her magnetic field is so
powerful I feel like I'm just

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.569 align:middle line:84%
a little dust ball about
to be pulled out of body

00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to
take me somewhere.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:10%
And I fear, because the
mystery of the deep sapphire

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:10%
color, the woman.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't announce her name.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:10%
And as I fear, I
hear three bells.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Bing, bing, bing,
these beautiful tones

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:90%
making the sign of the Trinity.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I look at my alarm
clock next to my wife,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:84%
a digital alarm clock while
I'm sitting up in bed.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And it goes from 1:10 to 1:11,
making the sign of the Trinity.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is I wake up
in the middle of the night.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It's getting onto 2:00 AM.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting all
this information

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:84%
on how to decode
the "Mona Lisa."

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Why David Sereda?

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1994, I began
to receive apparitions,

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
spiritual visions of
Jesus Christ blinding

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:90%
like 1,000 suns.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And in 1997 on Easter morning,
I saw Jesus again a second time,

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
blazing even brighter than
that fallen upon my face.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw
him again in 1999.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Jesus began to teach me
revelations and understandings

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
into the teachings of
singularity, of nondualism

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that were extant in all of the
major religions of the world.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Hindus called
nondualism [SANSKRIT]..

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha's nirvana
in the 6th century BC

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
is described as the nondual
supreme state of consciousness.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.764 align:middle line:84%
And now Jesus was
teaching me nondualism

00:16:51.764 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:90%
in the Christian literature.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me
where to find it.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But instantly upon
seeing Jesus Christ,

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.917 align:middle line:84%
I had this ability to
see invisible beings.

00:17:00.917 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It just started happening.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I've seen hundreds and
hundreds of invisible beings.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.962 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:08.962 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, some people think this
half is woman and this half is

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:10%
a man.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:10%
And so, to me, when I
look at the "Mona Lisa"

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:10%
really deep in side, I
feel like a Western version

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:10%
of [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's a
male and female energy merging

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:10%
to one in the beauty.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:10%
So that is "Mona
Lisa" to me too.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When we first
approached the "Mona Lisa,"

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
we could only see it from afar
because of the swarms of people

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that surrounded every
angle of the painting.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:10%
My family decided
to just pass it by

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:10%
and thought there was no
hope that they would ever

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:10%
clear a way for us to get it
anywhere close enough to really

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:10%
see the master work from Vinci.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:10%
So I decided that I
was going to just plow

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:10%
my way through about 50 people
and saying [FRENCH] all the way

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:10%
through.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
approach the very front

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:84%
where I was only inches away
from the "Mona Lisa" painting.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.800 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I
was more or less

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
waiting for some kind of mystery
to be revealed to me because

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:90%
of all that I heard about it.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
saw in art books,

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
something more was

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be revealed to
me seeing it face to face.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But I was really still only
left with the mystery of it.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:90%
So I took a picture.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And I still have the
picture to this day.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So now what happens is there
are hundreds of manuscripts

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
circulating throughout the
Roman Empire that are illegal,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that are called heresy
by the church, lies,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything outside of the
four canonized gospels.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Da Vinci is born in 1452.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
One year later, the church
at Constantinople in Turkey,

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
what is now Turkey, would
fall to the Muslim conquerors.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And the da Vinci is born
right at this pivotal point

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
in history that the
church was fully

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
founded in Rome in Italy,
the very place of where

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:90%
he was born.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And the new church, the Catholic
church, the one united church,

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:90%
would be his antithesis.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Da Vinci loved Jesus Christ.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
He becomes baptized
as a Christian.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
But we can see through his
proverbs and his great sayings

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that he was a rebel, that he
wanted to think for himself.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe that
da Vinci had clear access

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to the noncanonized
gospels themselves.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And he reveals his
greatest secret.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
He hides it in the greatest
masterpiece he ever created,

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.988 align:middle line:90%
the "Mona Lisa" itself.

00:20:33.988 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Mona Lisa," she is an
ancient symbol of the goddess,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of the princess, of the
mother, painted a long time ago

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and revered by most men and
women all over the planet.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
To me, she's right up there with
the goddess Nefertiti and Isis.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.715 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:28.715 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:84%
In the Apocryphon of
John, it is written

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that 550 days after
the crucifixion,

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
John was suffering
in the desert alone.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:84%
In a blaze of light,
Jesus appears to him

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and transfigures three times
from a young man to an old man

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and then into a servant.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says to John, John,
John, why do you doubt,

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:90%
or why are you afraid?

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:84%
You are not unfamiliar
with this image, are you?

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:90%
That is do not be timid.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I am the one who
is with you always.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I am the father.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:90%
I am the mother.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I am the son.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I am the undefiled
and incorruptible one.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But who is the servant if John's
trimorphic vision of Jesus

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
refers to the father,
mother, and son of God?

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.866 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.866 --> 00:22:39.246 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) Mona Lisa, Mona
Lisa, I know your secret.

00:22:39.246 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It is painstakingly
obvious who the servant is

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:90%
in the Apocryphon of John.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus reveals the
transmorphic vision to John,

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and he tells John, John,
John, why do you doubt

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:90%
or, why are you afraid?

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:90%
That is, do not be timid.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I am the one who
is with you always.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I am the father.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I am the mother.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I am the son.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:90%
So the servant, it's obvious.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we consider
that women were

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
the servants in the family in
the old Middle Eastern world

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and that Jesus' mother Mary was
his first servant as a child,

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus is speaking that
the servant is actually

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:90%
the mother of God.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:90%
The mother of God.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I am the father.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.180 align:middle line:90%
I am the mother.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And I am the son.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The first image John sees is
God with a white beard, whom

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Jesus never lived
to be old enough

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:90%
to have the white gray beard.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that
Jesus is showing John

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:90%
that he is the ancient of days.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
He is God, the god who
appeared to all the prophets.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And then he appears
as the young man

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:84%
whose beard is just
beginning, and then

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:90%
into the woman, the servant.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That God is saying something
to John here through Jesus,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that he is saying that
the image you have

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:17.050 align:middle line:84%
of God in the church as the
man, as the male dominant image

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:90%
of God, is wrong.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I am showing you that
God is both the father,

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and the mother, and
the son all in one,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:90%
this trimorphic vision--

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:84%
revelation to John is
that the image of God

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:90%
is feminine and masculine.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And the question is did Leonardo
da Vinci know the secret of God

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:84%
in the feminine, not
in the Magdalene,

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:84%
not in Mary Magdalene,
not in their relationship,

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:90%
but in God God's self.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I have always wondered or
believed that God is both male

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:10%
and female, masculine
and feminine,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:10%
because it said that we
are created in his image.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:10%
And if you look
at the scriptures

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:10%
when he covered the earth,
it means to womb the earth.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And even if you look at Adam and
Eve, Eve was taken out of Adam.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So within Adam was also
the feminine as well as

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:90%
the masculine.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So we are both
created in his image.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you put two
together, the two

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:90%
shall become one in marriage.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what it represents.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So what I believe is
in the "Mona Lisa"

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
is the Leonardo and
Lisa becoming one.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:90%
The two shall become one.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Mona Lisa
represents the oneness

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine
and the feminine.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Since mono means basically
the number one, single, Monday,

00:25:53.590 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:10%
monad was derived from that
to make the same definition

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.820 align:middle line:10%
through God.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Monad is any single unit of
being, such as a soul, God,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:90%
or the number one.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But it extends from the
mono of being just a unit

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:84%
one to actually being a
being of one, such as in God.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's why monad was used
in a lot of ancient scriptures

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:31.946 align:middle line:84%
as the singularity
or oneness of God.

00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:35.404 align:middle line:90%

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Although there is evidence
that Leonardo da Vinci

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:84%
encrypted messages
in his paintings,

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:84%
no one has decrypted the title
of the "Mona Lisa" until now.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It appears as an ordinary
name or the name of the woman

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:90%
he used to model for him.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci hid the
truth about "Mona Lisa"

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
deep inside the letters,
later to be confirmed

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:90%
in the painting itself.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Looking at ancient religious
methods of encryption

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and their origins
is the first clue.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:84%
In deep mystic philology,
there is a deeper meaning

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
as to why da Vinci encrypted
his secret message from right

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:90%
to left and left to right.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
This level of encryption was
used in the ancient Hebrew

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:84%
manuscripts the Kabbalah
and the Sepher Yetzirah.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:84%
As translated by
Wynn Westcott, quote,

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:84%
"the "Sepher Yetzirah,"
or "Book of Formation,"

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps the oldest
rabbinical treatise

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:84%
of Kabalistic philosophy,
which is still extant.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The Kabalistic principles
involved the reversal

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:90%
of Hebrew letters."

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
This reversal of
letters was used

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to reflect the dualistic
principles of the creation

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and man, which
the Sepher Yetzirah expounds

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:90%
upon.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:10%
In English, the word live
reversed spells evil.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:84%
This is an example
of historical dualism

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and early encryption
in English philology.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:84%
To play letters
forward and backwards

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:84%
as a method of encryption
would be too easy and obvious

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
for anyone good at
solving puzzles.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:84%
If Leonardo da Vinci named
his "Mona Lisa" using

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:84%
this simple encryption, it
would have long ago revealed

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:90%
a message that holds no meaning.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Asil Anom is Mona
Lisa in reverse.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:84%
This would not be a level
of encryption secure enough

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
for Leonardo da Vinci to hide
his most treasured message

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:84%
in the "Mona Lisa,"
sequestering it

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:90%
from the Inquisition's wrath.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci would
encrypt his message

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:84%
with a form of dualism
not yet imagined.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
He would use the
Fibonacci sequence

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to place a cipher in between
the letters "Mona Lisa"

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.120 align:middle line:84%
moving forward and
backward in sequence.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Because there are eight
letters in "Mona Lisa"

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and eight is a Fibonacci
number, all we have to do

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:84%
is look at the two previous
numbers in Fibonacci sequence

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that are added
together to get eight.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:90%
They are three and five.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:90%
3 plus 5 equals 8.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Leonardo da Vinci would
create another mysterious dual

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:84%
layer of encryption
beneath the obvious.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.870 align:middle line:84%
His secret cipher is
a simple apostrophe,

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:84%
which he would place left
to right and right to left

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in Fibonacci sequence between
the third and fifth letters

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:90%
in the title of the painting.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:84%
3 plus 5 equals 8
are all Fibonacci

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
numbers in perfect
sequence as in the eight

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:90%
letters of "Mona Lisa."

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We would read the message
left to right as the French,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Italian, and English do.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we start with mon,
the first three letters,

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:84%
firstly, we see that it comes
from the root word meaning mono

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:84%
or singular, or the
monad of God, which

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:84%
is the singularity,
the androgyny of God,

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:90%
which is male female in union.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And alisa in ancient
Hebrew actually

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.880 align:middle line:90%
means great joy in the feminine.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, alisa is a
woman's name in Hebrew.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
in ancient Hebrew

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:90%
means great joy in the feminine.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So once again, we have
singularity of God

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
brings great joy in the
feminine as one translation.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But then if we go to
translation number two,

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.340 align:middle line:90%
and we put the apostrophe here.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Which is five letters
in from this side,

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:84%
so we actually go
to Mona Lisa, this

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.290 align:middle line:84%
is where the break is at
the L. So Mona is one word

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and L apostrophe
is five letters in.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:90%
We come to Mona Lisa.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And if this is an
apostrophe right here,

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:84%
we have Mona the Isa,
because in French and Italian

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:84%
you can never have two
vowels facing each other.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't have [FRENCH],,
which means the star.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:84%
You have [FRENCH],,
which means the star.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.905 align:middle line:90%
So L apostrophe isa.

00:31:44.905 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Mona Lisa a code
word for a deeper meaning?

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Mona L apostrophe Isa
in Italian translates

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:90%
into English as Mona the Isa.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Isa is the name of
Jesus in Arabic.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Jesus's true name, according
to the holy Quran, was Isa.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So the translation of Mona
Lisa reads Mona the Jesus,

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:90%
denoting Mona is Jesus.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Did da Vinci know the secret?

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And if he knew the secret,
where did he hide it?

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it hidden in his most
famous painting of all time?

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Arguably, the most
famous painting

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.177 align:middle line:84%
in history of the world
is the "Mona Lisa."

00:32:36.177 --> 00:32:44.456 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING) I carry on.

00:32:44.456 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:90%


00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Is "Mona Lisa"
hiding a secret?

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We think of the right
hand, the masculine side,

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:84%
concealing the
left, the feminine.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that a symbol
that the masculine

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.320 align:middle line:90%
is hiding the feminine?

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for centuries, it
was argued is the Mona Lisa

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:90%
a man or a woman.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean even that was a
centuries old debate,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
because there is something
about her that's masculine.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's also something
about her that's feminine.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And we look at that mysterious
blinding glare in her eyes.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.295 align:middle line:84%
It's very obvious that
she is holding a secret.

00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
When the Center for
Research and Restoration

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:84%
did an X-ray photograph
of the "Mona Lisa,"

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:84%
x-rays are far more penetrating
than visible light rays

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and far more penetrating than
ultraviolet light rays, which

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:90%
we don't even see.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:84%
The X-ray image
reveals the iconoclasm.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.960 align:middle line:84%
There it is staring
us in the face.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the surface
of the "Mona Lisa"

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
is the hidden image
of Jesus Christ.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It is so obvious that this
image under the "Mona Lisa"

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is Jesus himself hidden,
concealed under the "Mona

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Lisa."

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the language,
the linguistics, Mona el Isa,

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:84%
is Mona in the feminine,
el, apostrophe, Isa, we see

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.095 align:middle line:90%
the translation, Mona is Jesus.

00:34:20.095 --> 00:34:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But there is also evidence
that the ancient Hindus knew

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Jesus as Isa in what is now
Tibet before Tibetan Buddhism

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:84%
was born in the
seventh century AD.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:84%
In the Bhavishya Maha Purana,
an ancient Hindu Sanskrit

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:47.150 align:middle line:84%
manuscript, it is written that
the King of the Sakya tribe

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.679 align:middle line:84%
Buddha's same Himalayan
tribe, in 623 BC

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:84%
described what
appears to be Jesus

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:90%
near Mount Kailash in Tibet.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the most sacred mountain
to the Hindus and Tibetans

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.480 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It is the abode
of Lord Shiva, one

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest of the
Hindu enlightened deities.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And there is Jesus,
Isa, in its midst.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:84%
It is written that the
Sakyan king described Isa

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:21.380 align:middle line:84%
as an auspicious man with a fair
complexion and white clothes.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
In the text, the king
asked, who are you, sir?

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Jesus replied blissfully,
you should know

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:90%
that I am Isa, the Son of God.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And I am born of a virgin.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Later in the text,
Jesus continues,

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and thus my name became Isa
Masiha, Jesus the messiah.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The point is clear that
Jesus is in India and Tibet.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And his name was
Isa, the same name

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that Leonardo da Vinci
chose to represent

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.715 align:middle line:90%
Jesus in the "Mona Lisa."

00:35:57.715 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The X-ray image
of the "Mona Lisa"

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.370 align:middle line:84%
clearly reveals
that this was not

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.040 align:middle line:84%
da Vinci's charcoal
sketch of what

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.980 align:middle line:90%
was to become the "Mona Lisa."

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:84%
The image is not of an
Italian woman, rather a man

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:84%
with the perfect features
of a Jewish rabbi, precisely

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.800 align:middle line:90%
as Jesus was to his disciples.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Nathaniel answered and
said to him, rabbi,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:90%
you are the Son of God.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.080 align:middle line:90%
You are the king of Israel.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
God instructs Moses, you
shall not around the corners

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.750 align:middle line:90%
of your heads.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Neither shall you mar
the corners of thy beard.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are
the Hebrew locks.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>> The payot.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:45.580 align:middle line:90%
The payot.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
traditional Hebrew locks.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And his hair is centered.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> This is not an Italian
image of the "Mona Lisa"

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:84%
as the sketch underneath is
clearly the image of Jesus

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Christ.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And look at the beard,
the short beard,

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and the space between the
beard and the edge of the ears.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> This was precisely why the
rabbis had the long ringlets

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of hair growing out
of their sideburns,

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:16.500 align:middle line:84%
just as Jesus does in
da Vinci's revelation.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.110 align:middle line:90%
This is clearly a man.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
see the eyebrows.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.410 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:90%
That's like a scar.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.900 align:middle line:90%
No, that's blood.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the blood from
the crown of thorns.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.834 align:middle line:84%
And there's blood here too
right at the corner of the eye.

00:37:31.834 --> 00:37:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Proving it's Jesus.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:90%
If

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We consider the
Inquisition and now we can see

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:84%
the evidence, the proof, what
da Vinci was trying to say

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:55.900 align:middle line:84%
in the "Mona Lisa" 500 years
ago was that God was both a man

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.700 align:middle line:90%
and a woman.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:84%
We can clearly see from
knowing the severity

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
of the persecution
of the Inquisition

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that da Vinci's
life was in danger.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.696 align:middle line:90%
He had to hide it.

00:38:07.696 --> 00:38:08.820 align:middle line:90%
They would have killed him.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.320 align:middle line:84%
The church would
have killed him.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's only today
in the 21st century

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that we could get away with
this-- that I could get away

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.910 align:middle line:84%
with this in my research
so I could tell the world

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and not be burned
at the stake myself.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But da Vinci, already
having passed away,

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.760 align:middle line:84%
his final secret
is revealed would

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.560 align:middle line:90%
be that he did this on purpose.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:90%
He had to hide it.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The man had to give us symbols,
the hidden hand, the masculine

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:84%
concealing the feminine, the
eyes, the androgynous image,

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.580 align:middle line:84%
the veil around the
head truly showing

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.930 align:middle line:90%
that this is truly a woman.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:52.590 align:middle line:90%
This is a feminine image.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And the veil suggesting
the virginity of the Mona.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And if we also look at--

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:84%
what is also more fascinating
is another translation

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:84%
of the "Mona Lisa" is Mona
compares to mono meaning

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:90%
singular or monad.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The monad is the
singularity of God.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And also that this
singularity of God

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:84%
brings great joy, because alisa
in ancient Hebrew means joy.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So Mona, the Mona,
Alisa is the singularity

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:90%
of God bringing great joy.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:90%
So yet there is a deeper image.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I believe da Vinci
spent so much time

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
thinking about how
profound his discovery was

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.472 align:middle line:84%
and how to code it in
the secret language.

00:39:41.472 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There is more devastating
proof that Jesus

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
could physically transfigure
into, anatomically,

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.640 align:middle line:90%
a woman in the Acts of John.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.060 align:middle line:84%
The Acts of John were banned
by Pope Leo the Great.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.490 align:middle line:84%
He ordered all copies
to be burned and erased

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:90%
from the face of the Earth.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.347 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, some of the
copies actually survived.

00:40:05.347 --> 00:40:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And the question is did
da Vinci have access

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to the Acts of
John, because what

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:84%
is written in them is a
scene where there is yet

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:84%
another transfiguration
in the Bible

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus takes his disciples
up onto the mountain where

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.360 align:middle line:90%
he used to pray.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And he transfigures into
this glorious light.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And John comes up upon him.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And he sees Jesus disrobes
of all of his clothes.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Jesus is naked.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And John says, since he loved
me, he let me come close.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And John comes close.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And he says he looks at his
hinder parts, his behind

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.710 align:middle line:90%
and his sexual organs.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And he sees that he
was not a man at all.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Not a man at all.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And if he was not a man at
all in the negative space,

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:84%
it could only mean one thing,
that Jesus was anatomically

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:84%
transfiguring as
a woman for John

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
to see the absolute proof
that he could appear

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:84%
as a woman and
also the fact that,

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in the uncanonized
gospels, there

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
is accounts of him
walking on the earth

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and leaving no
footprints behind.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:90%
No footprints.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Who can do this and
make the ground start

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.660 align:middle line:90%
to light up with light?

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the Acts of John, his
head stretches all the way

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.020 align:middle line:84%
into heaven and John is
terrified, terrified,

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.380 align:middle line:84%
of what he's seeing, his
master's form going from a man

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.110 align:middle line:84%
to a woman in the nude
and stretching his head

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
all the way into the
clouds in heaven.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.590 align:middle line:90%
And John is terrified.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus grabs him by the
beard so tightly that John

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.860 align:middle line:90%
goes into torrential pain.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus says, why
did you doubt me, John?

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Don't you understand
that I am who I say I am?

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.455 align:middle line:90%
I am God in the human flesh.

00:41:49.455 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If da Vinci did not have
direct access to the many

gnostic gospels depicting
the feminine Christ,

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.310 align:middle line:84%
how else could he
have known the secret?

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.810 align:middle line:84%
He may have had a vision
or apparition of Jesus

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:15.010 align:middle line:84%
where he would have been given
the same trimorphic revelation

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.010 align:middle line:90%
that John received.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:21.550 align:middle line:84%
da Vinci could have painted
Jesus Christ's portrait

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
through his own
eyes, which would

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
make this painting the
most accurate image of what

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Jesus really looked like.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.327 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:33.327 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:10%
>> The "Mona Lisa"--

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.100 align:middle line:10%
I actually looked into the
eyes of that "Mona Lisa"

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:10%
and received the transmission
from the smile, both the eyes

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:10%
and the smile holding the
wisdom transmitted from da Vinci

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.540 align:middle line:10%
onto canvas and
impacting me very,

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.040 align:middle line:10%
very deeply with the wisdom
from the Far East and the West

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.380 align:middle line:10%
coming together and a certain
knowing that I picked up just

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.440 align:middle line:10%
from that transmission.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that to this
very day, to this very moment,

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And just as much as
the transmissions

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that I have received
wherever I've traveled.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.375 align:middle line:84%
So I hold this one very
deeply in my memory.

00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:41.464 align:middle line:10%
>> Mystery, a knowing,
like a feminine knowing.

00:43:41.464 --> 00:43:43.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I think we're all
fascinated with the "Mona Lisa"

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.430 align:middle line:10%
because she represents the
essence of female mystery.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Antiquities of the
Jews" were written in 93

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of the common era
by Flavius Josephus,

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.810 align:middle line:84%
whose eyewitness account of
history and writings were

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:90%
highly respected.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:05.430 align:middle line:84%
He writes, now a woman is called
in the Hebrew tongue, Isa,

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.910 align:middle line:84%
but the name of this woman
was Eve, which signifies

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.010 align:middle line:90%
the mother of all living.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
This confirms that the name
for a woman in ancient Hebrew

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:84%
is Isa, the same name given
to be the name of Jesus

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:24.810 align:middle line:84%
by Leonardo da Vinci, the
Arabs, the ancient Hindus,

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.720 align:middle line:90%
and possibly the Hebrews.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But why would Jesus'
name mean woman

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:35.220 align:middle line:84%
unless it was code for Jesus
as God in the feminine?

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Was it well known that Jesus
could transfigure himself

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:43.050 align:middle line:84%
into a woman but hidden
from the eyes of historians?

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Is Leonardo da Vinci
telling the world

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.080 align:middle line:84%
in his most famous
painting that Mona Lisa

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.070 align:middle line:90%
is Jesus as a woman, the Isa?

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:84%
The Shroud of Turin
is believed by many

00:44:55.650 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
to be the true burial cloth
that Jesus' body was wrapped in.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Upon his luminous resurrection,
a photographic effect

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:09.420 align:middle line:84%
burned his negative
image into the fabric.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Developing a positive image from
the photograph of the negative,

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
we can see what appears to
be the image of Jesus Christ.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.940 align:middle line:84%
If it is proven to
be real, this could

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.050 align:middle line:90%
be the true face of Jesus.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.270 align:middle line:10%
International
radiocarbon-14 testing

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:31.200 align:middle line:10%
in Arizona, Oxford, and
Zurich date the fabric

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.270 align:middle line:10%
of the Shroud of Turin
from 1260 to 1390 CE

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:10%
to a degree of 95% accuracy.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Scholars argue that Leonardo
da Vinci could have had access

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:84%
to similar fabric
100 or so years old

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.540 align:middle line:84%
during his era of the
15th to 16th century.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Many scholars believed
the mystery was solved

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and that da Vinci was the
perpetrator of the hoax.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It was believed that he created
the shroud and the image

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.950 align:middle line:84%
was Vinci himself
posing as Jesus Christ.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Yet when the radiocarbon dating
came too close to the time

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that the shroud was
exposed to a fire in 1532,

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.500 align:middle line:84%
scientists realized the
carbon dating was flawed,

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.160 align:middle line:84%
because the fire had
deposited its own carbon.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.970 align:middle line:10%
The fire's carbon on the
shroud ruined any possibility

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.640 align:middle line:10%
of an accurate
radiocarbon-14 dating.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.010 align:middle line:10%
It was now clear this
was not a da Vinci hoax.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Other dating techniques may
prove the Shroud of Turin

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.770 align:middle line:90%
was from the time of Christ.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.750 align:middle line:84%
British author Philip
Gardner explains.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other things
about the Shroud of Turin is,

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.500 align:middle line:90%
of course, the weave.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.210 align:middle line:10%
It's very important
to understand

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:55.650 align:middle line:10%
that the cotton that
makes up this cloth

00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:10%
is actually woven
in such a way that

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.190 align:middle line:10%
gives us a dating and
an area of who did it.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Textile experts from across
the world flock to the shroud.

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And all the ones
that I've spoken to--

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:84%
come into contact
with it anyway--

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.850 align:middle line:90%
all say this is a Z twill weave.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It's 3.1 weave as they call
it, three in one weave.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:27.470 align:middle line:84%
That is particular to
an area and a time.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And that time and that
area is the first century

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:35.490 align:middle line:84%
of the Middle East, roughly
Damascus through to Jerusalem.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Can't pinpoint it
any more than that.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible really.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And this can take into account
either Jerusalem as we know it

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.310 align:middle line:84%
or, as some would have
it, the new Jerusalem

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:53.550 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes lived in
near Damascus and Kuram.

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting, of course,
because these Essenes are well

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.780 align:middle line:84%
known for having put together
what are now known as the Dead

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Sea Scrolls and
also for implying

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.650 align:middle line:84%
an awful lot of the future
history of a man known

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:08.090 align:middle line:90%
as Jesus.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.040 align:middle line:90%
They wore beards.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.840 align:middle line:90%
They wore white.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.680 align:middle line:10%
Cloth, linen, and the twill
weave that these people

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.180 align:middle line:10%
had matches the shroud.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>> At Texas University's Center
for Advanced DNA technologies,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Victor Tyron
and his wife Dr.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Nancy Tyron performed an
independent test for DNA

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.380 align:middle line:90%
on the Shroud of Turin.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.830 align:middle line:84%
They first established that the
threads contained human blood,

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and then that DNA was
present in the blood.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.740 align:middle line:84%
The DNA of the blood was
tested at Yale University.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.560 align:middle line:10%
Further testing of
the blood showed signs

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.870 align:middle line:10%
that the person
had been tortured,

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.030 align:middle line:10%
providing evidence
that it could really

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:53.810 align:middle line:10%
be the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.790 align:middle line:10%
According to an
article published

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:59.390 align:middle line:10%
in the Italian newspaper
"Chi," a DNA analysis

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.370 align:middle line:10%
of the blood on
the Shroud of Turin

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:03.500 align:middle line:10%
was conducted by
Professor Marcello

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:10%
Canale of the Institute of
Legal Medicine in Genoa, Italy

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.380 align:middle line:10%
in 1995.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.550 align:middle line:10%
Professor Canale
at the time said,

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:10%
"With regard to sexual
characteristics,

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.790 align:middle line:10%
we have positive
indications for both genders

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.540 align:middle line:10%
but much more positive
for the masculine one.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that there has
been some form of contamination

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.470 align:middle line:84%
as we cannot suppose that
the individual represented

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.100 align:middle line:84%
on the stains belong
to both sexes."

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:84%
While theories expounded
that a female nun had

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.610 align:middle line:84%
bled on the shroud,
polluting the DNA sample,

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:44.210 align:middle line:84%
there is no documented
evidence of this.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Yet Cardinal Saldarini
being advised by the pope,

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.750 align:middle line:84%
made a public statement
that repudiated

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the evidence of both
male and female DNA

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.140 align:middle line:90%
from the same blood sample.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:84%
He regarded it as being
insignificant and focused

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.990 align:middle line:84%
on the many people
throughout history that

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:04.070 align:middle line:90%
had handled the shroud.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:10.580 align:middle line:10%
>> What was really interesting
with the DNA was both male

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.092 align:middle line:10%
and female DNA has been found.

00:50:13.092 --> 00:50:15.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, that's interesting.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.750 align:middle line:10%
Scientists have put
this down to the fact

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:21.960 align:middle line:10%
that over time, there
have been many norms,

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.370 align:middle line:10%
many people work on
the shroud, mending it,

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:30.830 align:middle line:10%
repairing it from various fires
and other forms of damage.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
pricked their thumb

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and spilt some of their
blood in the very area

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:40.262 align:middle line:84%
that the blood of the
person in the shroud was.

00:50:40.262 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, it's become
contaminated over time.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.893 align:middle line:84%
Now this isn't beyond the realms
of science fiction at all.

00:50:45.893 --> 00:50:50.630 align:middle line:84%
This is highly possible, highly
likely that that's the case.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But one problem with that
is that DNA can't mix.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.900 align:middle line:84%
You cannot mix two
peoples' DNA together.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this evidence
of male/female DNA

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:84%
in Jesus's blood build the case
for the transfigurative Christ,

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
shape-shifting from male to
female, as in the Acts of John?

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.210 align:middle line:84%
The mystery of the woman
wearing the sapphire robe who

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:19.430 align:middle line:84%
appeared to David Sereda
on November 12th at 1:11 AM

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.530 align:middle line:90%
is starting to emerge.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:25.160 align:middle line:84%
In Da Vinci's painting,
"The Virgin on the Rocks,"

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.420 align:middle line:84%
we see the Virgin is wearing
a blue sapphire robe.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:84%
What is the significance
of this color?

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Why are Jesus and Mary Magdalene
wearing blue and scarlet

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.430 align:middle line:90%
in Da Vinci's "Last Supper?"

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Aaron, the brother of
Moses, was instructed by God

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to wear the ephod, a blue
robe, along with a breastplate

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of gems to protect
himself upon approaching

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:54.590 align:middle line:90%
God on Mount Hebron.

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The succession of all
the Hebrew priests

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.000 align:middle line:90%
were only allowed to be men--

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.750 align:middle line:90%
at least history tells us so.

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Why, then, does Da Vinci show
divine female personalities

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.750 align:middle line:90%
wearing the blue robes?

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Could he have coded them
as high priestesses?

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:17.503 align:middle line:84%
Did the high priestess once play
a role in the Jewish temple?

00:52:17.503 --> 00:52:19.968 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER]

00:52:19.968 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.460 align:middle line:84%
The theory that Jesus was
married to Mary Magdalene

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and had children to
continue the holy bloodline

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.980 align:middle line:84%
is now pervasive in modern
culture, but lacks evidence.

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:57.480 align:middle line:84%
While this idea was proposed
by numerous authors such as Dan

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Brown, Lawrence Gardner,
and Michael Baigent,

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:06.090 align:middle line:84%
none had discovered the evidence
hidden in the Gospel of Philip

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:08.100 align:middle line:90%
in a code language.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.730 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Philip
firstly states,

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.660 align:middle line:84%
"There were three who always
walked with the Lord--

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Mary, his mother, her
sister, and Magdalene,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.330 align:middle line:84%
the one who was
called his companion.

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:28.020 align:middle line:84%
His sister and his
mother and his companion

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.480 align:middle line:90%
were each named Mary."

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.640 align:middle line:84%
This establishes Mary
Magdalene as Jesus's companion,

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.090 align:middle line:84%
setting her aside from
being another disciple.

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.300 align:middle line:84%
She must have spent a
lot or most of her time

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:46.020 align:middle line:84%
with Jesus, as any
wife would have.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Her level of
spiritual realization

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to be Jesus's
companion would be that

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.590 align:middle line:90%
of a master, not a disciple.

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:58.260 align:middle line:84%
As the Gospel of
Philip continues,

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.480 align:middle line:84%
we can see that the
work prepares us

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.240 align:middle line:90%
for the mystery beyond mystery--

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that Mary Magdalene
is the great Sophia

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.740 align:middle line:90%
of Christ, the feminine Christ.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:16.770 align:middle line:10%
To understand this work, let's
define the Sophia of Christ.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Sophia in Greek means wisdom.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So many thought this simply
means the wisdom of Christ.

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:29.370 align:middle line:84%
The gospel the Sophia
of Christ reveals

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that Sophia is the feminine
consort of Jesus Christ

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and always was from the
beginning of all creation,

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.290 align:middle line:90%
before they both took birth.

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Sophia means wisdom.

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:45.000 align:middle line:10%
But deeper, if you look
in the Sophia of Christ,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.500 align:middle line:10%
the manuscript itself--

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.470 align:middle line:10%
one of the hidden manuscripts
in the Nag Hammadi Library

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:50.580 align:middle line:10%
collection--

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:54.900 align:middle line:10%
we can see that Sophia is
the feminine consort of God,

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.700 align:middle line:10%
and that she always existed
as God in the feminine,

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.270 align:middle line:10%
and the possibility that when
Jesus became the Son of God--

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.590 align:middle line:10%
God in the flesh--

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:09.180 align:middle line:10%
that she came with him as the
feminine, the daughter of God

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.870 align:middle line:10%
in the flesh, and that they
would become married and united

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.240 align:middle line:10%
and eventually give
birth to children.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Matthew said to him, Lord,
Savior, how was man revealed?

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.670 align:middle line:84%
The perfect Savior
said, I want you

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:26.640 align:middle line:84%
to know that he who
appeared before the universe

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.170 align:middle line:84%
in infinity, self-grown,
self-constructed Father,

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:36.000 align:middle line:84%
being full of shining light
and ineffable in the beginning.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the Sophia of
Christ reveals that the father

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.710 align:middle line:90%
has a feminine consort, Sophia.

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:47.970 align:middle line:84%
"And his consort is the Great
Sophia, who from the first

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:middle line:84%
was destined in him for union
by self-begotten Father."

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:57.570 align:middle line:84%
This establishes that Sophia
is the pre-eminent Father's

00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:90%
consort.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:84%
"He was given great
authority, and he ruled

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.750 align:middle line:90%
over the creation of poverty.

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:08.700 align:middle line:84%
He created gods and
angels and archangels,

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.400 align:middle line:84%
myriads without
number for retinue,

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.310 align:middle line:84%
from the light and the
tri-male spirit, which

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:18.420 align:middle line:90%
is that of Sophia, his consort.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:23.580 align:middle line:84%
For from this, God originated
divinity and kingdom.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, he was called God
of gods and King of kings."

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:33.040 align:middle line:84%
When we come back to look at
the Gospel of Philip's work,

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.450 align:middle line:84%
we can see Sophia with
clarity, that she is

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:39.480 align:middle line:90%
the feminine aspect of Christ.

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.060 align:middle line:84%
But is she Mary
Magdalene in the flesh?

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:48.570 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Philip reads, "The
apostle said to the disciples,

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:52.320 align:middle line:84%
'May our entire
offering obtain salt.'

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.170 align:middle line:90%
They called Sophia 'salt.'

00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Without it, no
offering is acceptable.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But Sophia is barren,
without child.

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:06.450 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, she is
called 'a trace of salt.'"

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Calling Sophia
barren, without child,

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:15.060 align:middle line:84%
describes Sophia as a person
who has not had children.

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Mary, Jesus's mother, clearly
has had her child, Jesus.

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.400 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Philip
does not refer to Mary,

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.880 align:middle line:90%
the mother of Jesus, anymore.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.030 align:middle line:90%
It refers to Mary Magdalene.

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Philip continues,
showing the absence of words

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.520 align:middle line:84%
from the Gospel's damaged areas,
and ends the sentence with,

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.860 align:middle line:84%
quote, and her
children are many.

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Sophia, barren, without child,
is called a trace of salt.

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Yet the apostles ask that
their entire offering

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:55.490 align:middle line:84%
obtain salt,
calling Sophia salt,

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and later revealing that
her children are many.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:04.160 align:middle line:84%
This shows that Sophia was
called both a trace of salt

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.240 align:middle line:84%
or salt, depending upon
her current state of being

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.420 align:middle line:90%
without or with child.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.100 align:middle line:84%
We can assume that
they called her

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:16.760 align:middle line:84%
a trace of salt when she
was without child to leave

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.380 align:middle line:84%
room for her children, who
would be called salt too,

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:25.220 align:middle line:84%
therefore calling
her simply salt when

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.320 align:middle line:90%
she bears her children.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.890 align:middle line:84%
This reveals the meaning
behind their entire offering

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:34.910 align:middle line:84%
obtaining salt, as opposed
to a trace of salt,

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and saying without it, no
offering is acceptable.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:43.370 align:middle line:84%
May our entire offering
obtain salt. Calling

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Sophia and her children
salt would translate as,

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.520 align:middle line:84%
may our entire
offering obtain Sophia,

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:57.050 align:middle line:84%
known as God in the
feminine, and her children.

00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:59.750 align:middle line:84%
At one time, soldiers
in ancient Rome

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:04.910 align:middle line:84%
were paid in part with a ration
of salt called a solarium,

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:10.520 align:middle line:84%
from the Latin word sal,
which means salt. Later,

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.370 align:middle line:84%
when salt was replaced with
an actual money allowance

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to buy the salt, the allowance
itself was called a solarium.

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, solarium came to
mean the wages themselves,

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and this led to our
calling ones pay a salary.

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:31.880 align:middle line:84%
This would denote that calling
Sophia and her children salt

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:36.350 align:middle line:84%
implies they are of great value,
for salt was highly valued

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:38.070 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:42.260 align:middle line:84%
This also shows salt was
used as a way of quantifying

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:47.300 align:middle line:84%
the amount of pay one received,
just as the apostles quantified

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Sophia's salt as being a trace
of salt when she was barren,

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.870 align:middle line:90%
without child.

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Did Sophia, known as God's
consort and Jesus's companion,

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.180 align:middle line:84%
whom is now known
as Mary Magdalene,

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.440 align:middle line:84%
give birth to Jesus
Christ's children on Earth?

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Did they leave behind a lineage?

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.430 align:middle line:84%
We know that Jesus was
conceived in the Virgin Mary

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.100 align:middle line:90%
by the power of the Holy Ghost.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
If God can create
a galaxy, let alone

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:24.110 align:middle line:84%
a universe, how simple it would
be to create life in the womb

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.960 align:middle line:90%
by the power of the Holy Ghost.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But now, we will see that
even that power and all power

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
is manifest in Jesus Christ
in the Gospel of Philip.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Quote-- what the father
possesses belongs to the son,

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and the son himself,
so long as he is small,

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
is not entrusted
with what is his.

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But when he becomes
a man, his father

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.770 align:middle line:90%
gives him all he possesses.

01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it was Jesus
who conceived himself

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
as son, because he is
one with the Father.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, the iconoclasm arrives
with perfect clarity

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
the reason for the
famous kiss given

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to Mary Magdalene by Jesus,
as in the Gospel of Philip.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody knows from the
Gospel of Philip and the Da

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Vinci Code that Jesus kissed
Mary Magdalene on the lips.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And he, according to the gospel,
he used to do this often.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
But with Dan Brown missed
is in the preceding

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.120 align:middle line:84%
phrases of the
Gospel of Philip, it

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.280 align:middle line:84%
is clear that the perfect
ones, as Jesus is,

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
have the power to conceive life
in the womb through a kiss,

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.060 align:middle line:90%
not through sexuality.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason for the famous
kiss given to Mary Magdalene

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
by Jesus is in the
Gospel of Philip.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Quote-- as for the wisdom
who is called the barren,

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.600 align:middle line:84%
she is the mother of the angels
and the companion of the Lord--

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Mary Magdalene.

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Jesus loved her more
than all the disciples

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and used to kiss her
often on her mouth.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.430 align:middle line:10%
Since the last
word was originally

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.550 align:middle line:10%
left out due to
damage, recent scholars

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:23.540 align:middle line:10%
have researched and agreed upon
the missing word being mouth.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Did Jesus cause
life to be conceived

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
in Mary Magdalene's
womb with the same grace

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and power that was bestowed
upon the Virgin Mary,

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:38.570 align:middle line:84%
only this time transferring
life through a kiss?

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Philip continues,
revealing the commotion

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:46.570 align:middle line:84%
among the disciples
over this extended kiss.

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
"They said to him, 'Why do you
love her more than all of us?'

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The Savior answered and said
to them, 'Why do I not love you

01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:58.030 align:middle line:90%
like her?

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
When a blind man
and one who sees

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
are both together
in darkness, they

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
are no different
from one another.

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
When the light comes, then he
who sees will see the light,

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and he who is blind will
remain in darkness.'

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
The Lord said, 'Blessed is
he who is before he came

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
into being, for he who is,
has been, and shall be.'"

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Is Jesus withholding
this secret because he

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
knows that Mary Magdalene
and their children

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
would face death
having this exposed?

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea that Mary Magdalene
and Joseph of Arimathea--

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
after taking the
body of Jesus Christ

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to his tomb in the
Resurrection and Jesus

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
appearing to Mary
Magdalene first

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
before all the other
disciples, and Jesus

01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
tells all of his disciples
to spread the gospel

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and go across the
world to migrate--

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Thomas is sent to India.

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Mark is sent to Egypt.

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
All the disciples are sent
into different directions

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.290 align:middle line:90%
around the globe.

01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But Mary Magdalene,
it is believed,

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
was sent all the way
to Western Europe.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
That she may have taken the
actual children, the offspring

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus and herself, and
hid them in Europe, somewhere

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:31.180 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, because the
wrath of the Roman Empire

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and the Jewish persecution of
the Christians was continuing.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
That the idea that
Jesus Christ was

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
going to become the new
power, the new central power

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
on the planet was still not
acceptable to the Romans.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But by the 16th century AD, in
the time of Da Vinci's birth,

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
it was clearly established
that Christianity

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
was the new religion
of the empirical world.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jesus becomes the
greatest icon of religion

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.200 align:middle line:90%
today.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.380 align:middle line:84%
There are 2.2 billion
Christians in the world today,

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.440 align:middle line:90%
and nearly a billion Catholics.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So Christianity becomes the
greatest power on the planet.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:13.570 align:middle line:84%
But the secret of
God in the feminine

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
is clearly revealed in
the Gospels themselves.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe Da Vinci
had access to this,

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and he encoded the Mona
Lisa with his greatest

01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:24.076 align:middle line:90%
secret of all time.

01:05:24.076 --> 01:05:37.130 align:middle line:90%


01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The Twelve Apostles
were nearly all murdered.

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
If Mary was pregnant,
she would have

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
had to flee far from the
reach of the Roman Empire

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
to find true security.

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Western Europe was
the only true place

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:56.040 align:middle line:90%
to find privacy and secrecy.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Philip continues,
suggesting their marriage

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
in heaven caused the
creation of the world.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, great is
the mystery of marriage,

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
for without it, the
world would not exist.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Why would Jesus say great
is the mystery of marriage

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
when marriage as we know
it is not a mystery?

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It is known that a man
and a woman can marry.

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:26.760 align:middle line:90%
The meaning is deeper still--

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.570 align:middle line:84%
for without it, the
world would not exist.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Jesus does not say human
beings would not exist.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
He says the world
would not exist.

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
He refers here to the
divine feminine, Sophia,

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and the masculine
son of God, Christ,

01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
referring to their marriage
as it was in heaven,

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:51.540 align:middle line:90%
which gave birth to the world.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.850 align:middle line:84%
This marriage
caused the Creation

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to be possible, as the
Gospel of Philip tells us.

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Quote-- I want you to know
that first man is called

Sophia, his consort,

begotten androgynous son.

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
