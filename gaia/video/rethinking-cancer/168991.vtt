00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> At one point, my husband
says, you know, doctor,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.140 align:middle line:90%
take her kidney.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Since the kidney is completely
covered and it's not

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.850 align:middle line:90%
functioning, take her kidney .

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said no,
and nobody in this hospital

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:90%
will do it.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:90%
She's terminal.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:90%
She has a few months to live.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Why put her through that
kind of an operation?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.229 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was feeling
a little better.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And I figured, OK, that's great.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with this thing.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.877 align:middle line:84%
Well, as soon as I got
off of the antibiotics,

00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
this thing started
to come back again.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a woman I worked
for for 15 years at the time.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:84%
She came and she said, Doris,
she's not going to make it.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
She told my mother,
she's going to die.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.345 align:middle line:84%
>> I went to a top oncologist;
breast oncologist in Sloan

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:04.019 align:middle line:84%
Kettering, and he said
that he put his 40--

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I remember him saying to me,
I put my 40 years' experience

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:90%
on the line here.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do this
chemotherapy regiment

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that I recommend, your
chance of survival is 15.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
If you do it, it's 65
or something like this.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> They wanted to do chemo
just to make sure that there

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
wasn't any cancer
in my lymph system.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I agreed to one treatment,
and it made me so sick,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I told the doctor, I said, I
will not continue at this time.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
that point in time

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that I was introduced
to the Foundation

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.236 align:middle line:84%
for Advancement
of Cancer Therapy.

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> In a world under assault
from pollutants that bombard

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
our environment, and chemicals
that contaminate our food

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and water, cancer
is on the rise.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Over 10 million Americans
are already afflicted.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
1 and 1/2 million new cases are
expected to develop this year.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And despite the
increasing effectiveness

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
of chemotherapy and radiation
to affect remissions and prolong

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
life, one in two men
and one in three women

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
will eventually develop
or die from the disease.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Over 500,000 people
in the United States

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
alone will die from
cancer this year.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:10%
Because of this grim prognosis
and because the toxic nature

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:10%
of conventional therapies
destroys healthy cells, even

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:10%
as it kills malignant
ones, an increasing number

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:10%
of doctors and patients
are now exploring

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:10%
safe, established
biological alternatives

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:10%
as a cure for cancer
and other diseases.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the foremost
organizations promoting

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
a biological approach
to cancer treatment

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
has been FACT, the
Foundation for Advancement

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:90%
in Cancer Therapy.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
For almost 40 years, until
her death at the age of 93,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
its president, Ruth Sackman,
had been raising the awareness

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
of physicians and
patients about fighting

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
cancer and other diseases
by natural means.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Her work, however,
continues to be

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
carried on by a
number of physicians

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and other medical
professionals who

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
share her approach to preventing
and combating disease.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Among them is Dr. Philip Incao.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Dr. Philip Incao.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:10%
I've been a physician
for over 40 years.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:10%
And for most of
those years, I've

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:10%
practiced a form of
integrative medicine called

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:10%
anthroposophic medicine.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:10%
I first met Ruth Sackman, the
founder and director of FACT,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:10%
in 1981, when my wife
and I consulted Ruth

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:10%
about my wife's breast cancer.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Ruth helped my wife very much.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And after that, Ruth and
I became good friends

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and coworkers until Ruth's
recent death at the age of 93.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Ruth firmly believed,
as I do, that we all

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
have the potential to
heal ourselves of cancer

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:90%
and other serious illnesses.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
For over 35 years, Ruth
helped more than 1,000 people

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
with cancer who chose a safe,
nutritional, restorative

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
treatment instead of relying
solely on conventional cancer

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
In this program, you
will meet five people

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
who sought guidance from FACT.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Four of them were
diagnosed with cancer.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:84%
One was diagnosed
with Lyme disease.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of them
have been disease

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
free for no less than 13
years, and in some cases,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.770 align:middle line:90%
for more than 30 years.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
All are well-documented
cases and are

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:84%
representative of a large pool
of long-term recovered patients

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:90%
assisted by FACT.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
At the conclusion
of these interviews,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I will have a conversation
with Dr. Sheryl

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Leventhal about the
significance of these cases.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Leventhal is a
former oncologist

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.687 align:middle line:84%
and is currently a practitioner
of functional medicine.

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In November of '93, I was
going for my yearly checkup.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:90%
That was a thing to do.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I was very healthy,
but the checkup

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:90%
had to be done every year.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And my doctor had an x-ray
machine in his office,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:90%
and he would x-ray the chest.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And he called me
home and he said,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
you know, Rita, I see a
little pin spot on your lung.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't there a year ago.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I need you to go to
a radiologist who

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:90%
is more professional.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.649 align:middle line:84%
So it took a week or two,
and I went to a radiologist,

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and he called the
doctor and he says,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I see that
little pin spot.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
But you know what, we
don't know what it is.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Have her come back
in three months.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said,
no, if it's there today

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't there yesterday,
I'm not waiting three months.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
He called me and he directed
me to a, for C-T, a body scan.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was on the
17th of November, '93.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And we came home, and 4:00,
I got a call from the doctor,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and his statement is,
Rita, you have cancer.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And I say, where?

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And he says all over.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do
you mean, all over?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
He says in the kidney, in
the liver, in the lungs.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:10%
You need to go to
see oncologist.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:10%
And he got me an appointment
in Sloan Kettering.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:10%
They immediately said that
it's renal cell carcinoma

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:10%
with metastasis to the lung.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:10%
In plain language, it's
kidney cancer and spread

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:10%
into the lungs.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Every time we went there, he
underlined, you are terminal.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:90%
You are terminal.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
At one point my
husband says, you

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:90%
know, doctor, take her kidney.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Since the kidney is
completely covered

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's not functioning,
take her kidney.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said no,
and nobody in this hospital

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:90%
will do it.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:90%
She's terminal.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:90%
She has a few months to live.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Why put her through that
kind of an operation?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, my
husband spoke to his cousin

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
in Florida who is a kidney
specialist for children.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And he requested
all the information.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
We sent him the slice from
the biopsy and the tests,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and he called, he says,
you come right down here.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:90%
You're a walking bomb.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:90%
That kidney has to come out.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
When I arrived in Florida,
it was the end of December.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I received a phone call from
a friend who said, Rita,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
come with my son.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I have met her son once
before, and he looked peculiar.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was explained to
me that he's a vegetarian,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
so I thought vegetarians
looked peculiar.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But I agreed, and I prepared
oranges, I made a salad.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I made sure that the man had
something vegetarian to eat.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And he explained to me that
he's a cancer survivor.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
He is a member of
FACT organization.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:90%
He spoke about Ruth Sackman.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
Rita, you don't have to die.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't even have to be sick.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
change lifestyle.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And he took a yellow pad, and
he drew a line in the middle,

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and he said, as of
this minute, you have

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:90%
to stop eating meat, chicken.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop drinking
milk, eating cheese.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:90%
You cannot open cans.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:90%
A very, very long list.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
On the right side he wrote
organic egg, organic vegetable,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:90%
organic fruit.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:90%
A little soup.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:90%
And Rita, you need to detoxify.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:90%
You'll be OK.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.071 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no wonder
he looks peculiarly.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:90%
He's crazy.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
If I follow his direction, I
am not going to die of cancer.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:90%
I will probably die of hunger.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And I really ignored
what he said.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:90%
He left.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And about three or four
days after he left,

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I got a call from the
hospital that they

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
have to postpone the operation
because I am extremely anemic,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and they have to build
me up with iron pills.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So I called Daniel,
and I told him,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
he says, under no circumstances
are you to take iron pills.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're anemic, I need you to
drink organic beets, carrots,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
organic spinach and carrots,
two or three times a day.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.130 align:middle line:84%
After two weeks, I went back to
the hospital for a blood test,

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and the nurse came out, and
she says, Rita, I'm so sorry.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
In the lab, they mixed up
your blood with somebody else.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I have to do it again.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:90%
She comes out after 10 minutes.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
She says, you know what, we
don't know what's going on.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
You're not anemic, and
you have enough blood

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to donate towards
your operation.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
They checked it again,
they spoke to the doctor,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not anemic.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So they rescheduled
it for March 9.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And as we're driving home,
I said to my husband,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, all my
life, I was anemic.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And everything the doctors
did, nothing helped.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
For two weeks I'm drinking
the juice, and I'm not anemic.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
There is something to
this kind of approach.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
The doctor who was
preparing to operate on me

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:84%
took me to an
oncologist, because he

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
was practicing something
new called immunotherapy.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And a month and a half after
the operation, I went back

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor, and he did
a chest x-ray, and he says,

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:90%
I like your approach.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.959 align:middle line:84%
Let's wait with
the immunotherapy.

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
You continue doing
what you're doing,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to watch you.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
The only reason he didn't
push for immunotherapy

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:84%
is after my lifestyle,
he saw less nodules.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:90%
At one point, he saw 12.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.582 align:middle line:84%
At another point, he saw them a
little weaker, not as obvious.

00:11:24.582 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And little by little, at
one point he says, you know,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:90%
I see only nine.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
He says, let's continue doing
what you're doing, Rita.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:90%
It looks good.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing my stuff
and he was checking on me,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and every time I came,
he says, it looks good.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It looks good.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:90%
So I never had immunotherapy.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I never had chemotherapy
or radiation.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with Daniel
for about a year and a half

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:90%
almost daily.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:84%
He would call me, he would
stay with me on the phone.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
He would teach me how
to get away from stress.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
He would fill in some parts
about what I should eat.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And I became a fanatic.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I eat only organic.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I cook my own meals.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:90%
I drink juices.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I drink only distilled
water that I make, my own.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And finally Daniel
said, that's it, Rita.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I have taught you
whatever I could.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:90%
You must call Ruth.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
called Ruth Sackman.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think the day I
called her, I was born.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:84%
She has taught me what
life is all about.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, healthy life.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
She taught me it's
OK to feel sick,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
mean you're sick.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Our body is in a detoxification
state many, many times.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you detoxify,
it could be a headache,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
it could be throwing up,
it could be diarrhea,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
it could be stomachache,
it could be blood in urine,

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:90%
it could be anything.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Do not get scared.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Do not run to a doctor.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Give yourself a few days.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Ruth gave me a list of
juices, and my husband

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:90%
would do the juice.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Then I would have a
fresh vegetable soup

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:84%
from organic vegetable
that my husband cooked.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I would have a lot of salad.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And my main meal
was organic fruit.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I would eat every fruit
that was in season.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.055 align:middle line:84%
And as weak as I was,
I was exercising.

00:13:31.055 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I think being with Ruth,
seeing what happened to me,

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that everything
she said is true,

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I became a self-reliant
person, and I

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:90%
don't let doctors twist my arm.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And 13 years later, I'm here,
even though the doctors gave me

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:90%
only two months to live.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was young,
in fifth grade,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:10%
I had a problem
with my right elbow.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:10%
Many years later, I had
a similar, I would say,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:10%
identical problem
in my left wrist,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:10%
where my left wrist
swelled up pretty much

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:10%
to the size of a tennis ball.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And finally at age 28,
it got very severe.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
It was in 1978,
almost 30 years ago.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was cancer.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It was not only in my bone, but
it was also in my lymph system.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
They scheduled a series
of radiation treatments

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:90%
just to the wrist.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And then after we finished
that course of treatment,

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to do chemo just
to make sure that there wasn't

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:90%
any cancer in my lymph system.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I agreed to one treatment,
and it made me so sick,

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I told the doctor, I said, I
will not continue at this time.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
that point in time

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that I was introduced
to the Foundation

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
for Advancement
of Cancer Therapy.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I started
interviewing people.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And my preference was people
who had a long-term survival

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
rate, because I figured
those are the people who've

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:90%
been there, done that.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And I grabbed everybody I could,
and it was very intensive.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:17.497 align:middle line:84%
So it left me with a great
deal of hope and confidence,

00:15:17.497 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:84%
because when you talk to people
who've been there and done it,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and have been around for
seven, eight, 10 years to talk

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
about it, and some
of these people

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
were deathly ill, much
worse off than I was,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I placed a lot of
emphasis on that.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't want the guy who got
over cancer last year and gee,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling great.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And say, oh, great,
I'll go do what he did.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have too
many good friends

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:84%
who have died after being told
that they were 100% cured.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So when I went
back to my doctor,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that was the point at which
I had already half made

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
up my mind, but I was still kind
of scared to leave the experts

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:90%
behind.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll use that in quotes.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I gave him an
hour and a half exam.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I had three pages of
questions, and I have to say,

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
he was very kind,
gave me a lot of time.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Answered all my questions
as fully as he could.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the interview,
I was not overly impressed.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I was impressed with him as
a man and his intelligence

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.189 align:middle line:84%
and his training, but I wasn't
impressed with his results.

00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
point in time I told him

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I had decided I was going
to go another route,

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:90%
and he asked what it was.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I told him that I was going
to follow the Foundation's

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:84%
recommendations,
and he got furious

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
with me, at which point in
time he lost his temper.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
He felt I was going
down a quack route.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I was taking something
that was going to lead me

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.592 align:middle line:90%
astray and waste valuable time.

00:16:43.592 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime,
cancer would be spreading,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and I'd be dying, and all that.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was
interesting, because he

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:84%
was trying to sell me on his
approach, and he was saying,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.730 align:middle line:84%
you know, I lost my
mother to cancer,

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and I lost my sister to cancer,
and I lost my sister-in-law

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:90%
to cancer.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And don't you think I
would have done everything

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:90%
in my power to save them?

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, yeah, I
would, I said, but you're not

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:90%
really selling me.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
You're not very convincing,
because you know,

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
he's sitting here telling
me about his failures

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:90%
with his loved ones.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, OK.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think he had as
good or better a track

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
record than many oncologists.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:84%
So all it did was
cement my resolve.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Once I decided that I was going
to leave orthodox medicine

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
behind and try the
route that I had learned

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
about with the Foundation,
the first thing I realized

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:84%
was that I really could not rely
on the doctor to make me well.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I had to become my own prime
contractor, so to speak.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
make the decisions.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
My first decision, of course,
was to take a different route.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
daunting, but it's also,

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I think, part of
your healing process,

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
because I was no longer
relying on someone else

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:90%
to make me well.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:10%
I was going to make me well.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:10%
Ruth connected me
with William Kelley,

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:10%
who had recovered
from pancreatic cancer

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:10%
many years ago.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:10%
And he had a very,
very intensive program

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:10%
which I went on.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Huge questionnaires,
personal interviews.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And they come up with a
dietary regimen, supplements,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
body cleansing,
internal and external.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Very, very thorough program.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they try to do is
focus on your metabolic type

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to determine what's the
ideal diet for you, what

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
is your body missing, what
nutrients are you lacking,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
what organs are not
functioning properly.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So they come up with a complete
program, both food, liquids,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
body cleansing, and
supplementation,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and other aspects as well.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And I got this huge manual
that I had to follow,

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.186 align:middle line:84%
and I followed it
extremely religiously.

00:19:00.186 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I started the
Kelley program, of course

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of physical
pain from the cancer,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
because I had a very
weak left wrist.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I was overweight.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I was sluggish and had
very little energy.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But after being on the program
for probably three or four

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:84%
weeks, I actually started
feeling a little worse.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Like I mentioned earlier,
detoxifying dumps stuff.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Your body knows when
it's time, knows

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
when it's strong enough to
start getting rid of the junk.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And it won't do it until
it's capable of doing so,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
or at least that's
been my experience.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
When I started getting
these healing crises,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
as they call them, where
you're dumping toxicity out

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
of your cells and into
your eliminative channels,

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and you start feeling
sick, of course,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you think about
is, oh god, what do I have?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what happened?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting worse.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Of course I would call
Ruth and say, jeez,

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.476 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say, don't
worry, don't worry.

00:19:58.476 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:90%
You're doing just fine.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course you do worry at
first, because cancer is scary.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.780 align:middle line:90%
You don't really want to die.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
With her guidance still, I kept
a base level of supplements.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:10%
A lot of pancreatic
enzymes, a lot

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:10%
of supplements to help boost
those organs that you really

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:10%
need to get healthy, your
thymus, your thyroid,

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:10%
your liver, your pancreas.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:10%
As I went through
the program, there

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.540 align:middle line:10%
was a test called the human
chorionic gonadotropin

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:10%
analysis, which
is a simple urine

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:10%
test that measures the
presence of the hCG

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:10%
hormone in your system.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Although it's not a direct
measure of cancer activity,

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
what it does is,
it shows the degree

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of cell division
occurring in your body.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
As I started to
feel better, I could

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:84%
see my levels of this
hormone dropping, which

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.282 align:middle line:84%
indicates a lower
degree of cell activity.

00:20:54.282 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, first off, that's
good emotionally,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:84%
because you say, oh, good,
the activity is dropping.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:84%
When I first got out of the
hospital, just moving my wrist

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:90%
that much was excruciating pain.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do anything
with my wrist.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have never done
anything since that time,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:84%
other than the program that
I've been on for years.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And my wrist has grown back.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm a classical guitarist.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
that I can still

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
play classical guitar today.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's very strenuous
on your left wrist.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
FACT was instrumental
in my recovery.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:10%
And Ruth monitors people
over the long haul,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:10%
because that's what
she interested--

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:10%
she's not interested in the
whiz bang cure of today.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
She wants the proven,
time-honored effective

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
technologies, the
things that work.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So biorepair really
is a good term

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:90%
to describe what we went on.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But you're not using
drugs to biorepair.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
You're cleaning out
the junk, you're

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:90%
putting in the good stuff.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.649 align:middle line:84%
You're giving your body
what it needs to thrive,

00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving it
the right environment.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lifestyle change.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.959 align:middle line:84%
I just know that the body
is remarkably resilient,

00:22:04.959 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and if you just give
it half a chance

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and you do the things right,
if you get the bad stuff out

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and you put the good stuff
in and you get your attitude

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
right, and you take
charge, you can do it.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's much smarter.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
You just stay on a good
program all your life,

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you're
going to live longer

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to be healthier,

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.255 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be happier.

00:22:23.255 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:90%
But hey, there it is.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> My cancer diagnosis
happened while I was studying

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:90%
for the master.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Since I was in
infertility treatment,

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing doctors
all the time.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I had just had a
checkup in months

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:84%
before I touched my breast, and
I feel a pretty large tumor.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And I go back to
my gynecologist,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and he touches it, and oh,
you won't die from this.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Three months later
or four months later,

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing my gynecologist
for my infertility testing.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And so he checks me and
said, I don't like this.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is an NYU
doctor, and said,

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go get it out,
or at least have a biopsy.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I go get a biopsy,
and this is a concern.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Apparently it's an
aggressive type of cancer.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
I remember the date.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
The date of the diagnosis was
the 29th of December, 1982.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:10%
Because a year
later on that date,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:10%
my first daughter was
born, and I thought to me

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:10%
that was kind of the
triumph of my will,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:10%
and I got a confirmation
that yes, this

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:10%
is going to be life, not death.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't dare do nothing.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So I did have a mastectomy,
and then of course,

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
they recommended radiation
and chemotherapy,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and I went to a top
oncologist, breast oncologist

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:90%
in Sloan Kettering.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And he said that he put his 40--

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember him saying to me,
I put my 40 years' experience

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:90%
on the line here.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do this
chemotherapy regiment

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that I recommend, your
chance of survival is 15.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
If you do it, it's 65
or something like this.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
I'm not doing it.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:84%
The thought that
made me decide is

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that spending my last
year feeling horrible,

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.350 align:middle line:84%
because I know what
chemotherapy feels

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.770 align:middle line:84%
like, that was not the way
I wanted to end my life.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So basically I went
to the alternative.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Not with the idea
that I necessarily

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
will be successful, but
with the idea that at least

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a choice about how I
live the last part of my life.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:84%
A friend kind of
mentioned it to me

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is this organization
that I could call and get

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:90%
some information.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't easy talking
to Ruth in the beginning.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't easy, either.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an immediate--

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:90%
because Ruth is a warrior.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And she's very harsh.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time,
a cancer diagnosis

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
always is a very scary and
very frightening experience.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe the first
time as a young person,

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I think also at any
age, it's the first time

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
that you kind of
face your mortality,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because we do live as
if we will live forever.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So I figured out then that
Ruth may have very, very

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:90%
useful information for me.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But she will not be
somebody who will

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
be very helpful in helping
me with my emotional struggle

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.600 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, I
think her strong opinions

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
were helpful, too, because
this alternative is

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:90%
a very demanding alternative.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It's much more demanding
than just going to the doctor

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and putting your
arm out and sitting

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:90%
through a chemotherapy session.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:84%
It really requires a
total transformation

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
of all your habits and
your way of thinking,

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.050 align:middle line:90%
and about everything.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not only about
food and health,

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:90%
but it's about life in general.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And the alternative
that Ruth suggested

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
was that I am becoming the
agent of my life, of my health.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a lot of work,
it takes a lot of discipline.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:10%
The really revolutionary
idea in my mind

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:10%
is that the body has a
capacity to heal itself,

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:10%
and that all we
need to do really

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.070 align:middle line:10%
is to bring it
into a place where

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:10%
it can do the healing that
it knows how to do better

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:10%
than any doctors and any human.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
wisdom of the body.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.780 align:middle line:84%
That required
changing diet, meaning

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
moving towards organic
food as much as I

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:84%
can, towards raw food
as much as possible,

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
because you want to get the
life energy that's in the food.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:90%
And then the cleansing.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
My understanding, that
particular with breast cancer,

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
the state of the colon
is really crucial

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and how clean or
unclean the colon is.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So I started with a very
rigorous cleansing program.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge that you've
done everything you can,

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
to me, there was something
very reassuring about it.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:10%
And beyond this, now
I can wait calmly.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:10%
I don't wait anxiously.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting very
calmly, because I

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:84%
know everything that could
have done have been done.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not like esoteric
belief that makes no sense.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I think to me it
make deep sense.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not trying to--

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and at the time, I didn't
talk to anybody else.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want scientific
proof for anything,

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:90%
for any of these claims.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:90%
It didn't interest me.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:90%
It made sense to me.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It just made sense that
this body has this wisdom

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
to heal itself, and all
I need to do is help it.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense, that's all.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:90%
What else can I say?

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:17.780 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of times we
would go out after work.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.724 align:middle line:84%
There was golf
courses fairly nearby.

00:28:22.724 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And we would go out, and
we'd play golf either

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
on the weekend, and talked
through work situations or what

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:90%
have you.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I looked down and I had the
red ring, you know the classic,

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would call it a
classic red ring on my arm.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, so I
got bit by something.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:10%
And it was at the time
where Lyme disease was not

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:10%
popularized, if you will, so
not everybody knew about it.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say over the
course of several weeks,

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I started to get a headache,
I started not to feel so well.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Definitely could not sleep well.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Then went to my
family physician,

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:05.299 align:middle line:84%
and he recommended the
standard course of antibiotics.

00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And I did start to feel better.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.839 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, this is great.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to sleep.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, it wasn't 100%.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, as soon as I got
off of the antibiotics,

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
this thing started
to come back again.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So that my doctor had
recommended that I go

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.916 align:middle line:90%
see a specialist over at Yale.

00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
The course of action
that they wanted to take

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
was using a, what I understood
to be a powerful antibiotic

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:90%
called Rocephin.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:90%
So I started feeling great.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say 100%, but
it was like, oh, my god,

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting some relief.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to sleep.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.930 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms were going
away, which was great.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Finished the course
of antibiotics, which

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:90%
was like, oh, thank goodness.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Two or three weeks later,
symptoms were back again.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Same symptoms just as
powerful, felt just as lousy.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to the
specialist, and I was like,

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:90%
can you please help me?

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Right, so we know
the antibiotics

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:90%
appeared to be working.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to get this
thing wiped out of my system?

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The course of action
that we'd like to take

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
is, we'd like to
double the dose.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.375 align:middle line:84%
We're confident doubling the
dose will wipe this thing out.

00:30:15.375 --> 00:30:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm thinking, OK, let's
see, you were confident

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.670 align:middle line:84%
before that the original dose
was going to wipe it out,

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't do it.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But now you're
confident to double

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the dose of antibiotics,
which is already

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.560 align:middle line:90%
impacting my system anyway.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, this
just doesn't sound right.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, at the same
time, a friend of mine

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.130 align:middle line:84%
who lived in the city
who I was talking to,

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I was going through my whole
scenario of what was going on.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And my friend said, well, I
know of this organization called

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:90%
FACT.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And you should give them a call.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And Ruth Sackman, you
should contact Ruth Sackman

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and just go through what
you're going through.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, OK, FACT.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.302 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
it's an organization that

00:31:07.302 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
helps with cancer
treatment and the like.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Like.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, well,
I don't have cancer.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:90%
At least, I don't think so.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Is this the right fit?

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
go to a foot doctor

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:84%
if you're having a problem with
your elbow or something, right?

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I called up Ruth, and
I started a talk her

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:90%
through what my symptoms were.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.112 align:middle line:84%
And she's very matter
of fact, right?

00:31:30.112 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was told this
from my friend.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It was like, you know, Ruth's a
fabulous person, great person,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:84%
but she's going to
be matter of fact.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Here's what it is, here's
what I want you to do.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.990 align:middle line:84%
If you would like to try
it, you need to do it.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You can't play
with, hey, I'm going

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:84%
to do the antibiotics
as well just as a backup

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:90%
and do this whole thing, right?

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
counterproductive.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:84%
They don't work well
together, right?

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I had to talk to her
several times to--

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't to understand.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.870 align:middle line:10%
Ruth was very clear, right?

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:10%
But it was a matter of getting
an understanding of what is it

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.580 align:middle line:10%
that I needed to do,
how would it help me,

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:18.960 align:middle line:10%
and why would I be doing this
when a doctor isn't telling me

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:10%
this stuff?

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
really understand, OK,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:84%
so everything makes sense
from what Ruth was saying.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, why
wouldn't I do this?

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But then I thought, OK,
well, she's not my doctor.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I haven't checked
her credentials.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is a person that
I'm talking to on the phone

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and getting great
suggestions and advice.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, well,
should I do it?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
there's no medications.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, why wouldn't I do it?

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:90%
It makes a lot of sense.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't I try it?

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So my thought was, great, Ruth,
let's move forward with this.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started to go through,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I'll call it the
treatment with her,

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:84%
her suggestions of what would
help detoxify my system.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.459 align:middle line:84%
And Ruth was great, talked me
through every step of the way

00:33:16.459 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and really said,
you're going to take

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
fluids to help make sure you're
not going to get dehydrated.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:84%
There's certain combinations
of vitamins, herbs.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would take that stuff,
and it was like, amazing.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:84%
As I went through the day, I
remember getting reactions.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:90%
My body was reacting.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I think my face was
getting exceptionally red,

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and I'd call Ruth.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Ruth, Ruth, I'm
getting a reaction.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Should I stop this whole thing?

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.030 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, no,
that's a normal reaction

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:90%
that people would get.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:84%
As you're detoxifying,
you're going to sweat,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:56.100 align:middle line:84%
because your body is trying
to rid itself of the toxicity.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what I found,
at the end of the first day,

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and as I got into
the second day,

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:10.139 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was around 24
to 48 hours, 80% of my symptoms

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:90%
had totally left.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first time
that I felt so great like that,

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.295 align:middle line:84%
and my mind was
getting so clear.

00:34:17.295 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, my
god, this is amazing

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:26.726 align:middle line:84%
that I can feel so great just
from doing this easy fast.

00:34:26.726 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Right, and it's like,
wow, I don't care

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:90%
what else may come out of this.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:90%
I feel fantastic.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So after that point, I
made a conscious effort.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.806 align:middle line:84%
I had gotten a juicer to be
part of this program as well.

00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:84%
So getting into the
healthy, you know,

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:45.300 align:middle line:84%
the carrot juices and the
like, in helping the system

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.746 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

00:34:46.746 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's
one thing I've

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
learned over time with Ruth is
that hey, your body, if you're

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:84%
given the right materials,
and right materials being,

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:84%
hey, the right food,
the right mindset,

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.705 align:middle line:84%
and given the right environment,
it actually heals itself.

00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:06.330 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It was 1971 that I found
myself not feeling well.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Tired, exhausted, depressed.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I did go to the doctor.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:90%
He checked me over.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:84%
What happened was my
breast was very blue.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And big, I had a large
lump on my breast.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a massive cancer,
and it was quite bad

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.840 align:middle line:84%
because they had to remove
the whole breast at that time.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And my weight was 135,
and went down to 108.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
When they sent me home,
they told my husband

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that there was nothing
more they could do for me.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I was so bad that
I couldn't walk.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't talk.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.620 align:middle line:90%
My friends came in to see me.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even recognize them.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman I worked for
for 15 years at the time.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:84%
She came and she said, Doris,
she's not going to make it.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:84%
She told my mother,
she's going to die.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So my sister told
my mother, we've

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.870 align:middle line:84%
got to get ready for my
funeral arrangements.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.630 align:middle line:84%
My mother had the
doctor come in.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.680 align:middle line:84%
He came in, and he said,
I don't know why I'm here.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.810 align:middle line:90%
I can't help her anymore.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Her cancer is all over her body.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:90%
She is terminal cancer.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:90%


00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I can give her more drugs.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.090 align:middle line:90%
My mother said no.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And then we went into nutrition.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't eat.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't swallow.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:90%
All I did was drink juice.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was a juice glass,
and they put a straw in it,

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and they kept saying,
Doris, you have to drink.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I started with apple,
carrot, and celery juice.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
That was sort of the
main juice that I drank,

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and then they switched
it to other types

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:90%
of vegetable juices.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.710 align:middle line:84%
But the pain that
I went through,

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.940 align:middle line:84%
you go through reactions
that is unbelievable.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:90%
I went through fever.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.360 align:middle line:84%
They checked my blood
pressure every day.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.110 align:middle line:84%
My husband would come
in say, Mrs. Sackman

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:90%
said those are reactions.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what, though?

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting better.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I was bleeding here again.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:90%
I was broken again.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And I, I can't do it.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.830 align:middle line:90%
He says, you could.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And you go through
a lot of cleansing

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that causes, you know,
when your body is so toxic,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and it has to clean some way,
and then with the cleaning,

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.390 align:middle line:84%
you get pain, and not to
be afraid of the pain,

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:90%
because it's a good sign.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of my friends
came in and said, Doris,

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.090 align:middle line:84%
you mean the diet
does this to you?

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes are so
bright and so white.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.770 align:middle line:90%
You're like a baby.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Got eyes like a baby.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.540 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, I don't know.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I just remember
my head was clear,

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I knew my friends
were coming in.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a joy.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to my husband
and say, I feel so good,

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.910 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think that I
would be in this condition

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.390 align:middle line:90%
and feel so well.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:90%
And my doctor called me.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:84%
He says, I don't
believe you're alive.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes,
doctor, I'm alive.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Please tell me, what type
of cancer did I have?

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
He says, you had
number four, and you

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.680 align:middle line:90%
were a very, very sick girl.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.670 align:middle line:84%
It was impossible for
you to get better.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.980 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't have done it alone.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And the help from my husband,
my family, and especially

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Ruth Sackman.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:90%
She was just wonderful to me.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.740 align:middle line:84%
She's a knowledgeable,
loving, and a kind person,

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:84%
that she understood me, and
that's all that mattered.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.426 align:middle line:84%
As she always said, it's
not her that did it.

00:39:02.426 --> 00:39:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And I really respect
her very much.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:90%
She said, it was you, Doris.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make
your salad for you.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.120 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's the truth.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.850 align:middle line:10%
You have to be the one
that's willing from the heart

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:10%
and believe that this
is going to work.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not an easy program,
but it's a program

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.630 align:middle line:90%
that certainly does work.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:36.246 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.246 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Leventhal, I once read
something that you said about

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:84%
your change in career from
oncology to functional

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.320 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.340 align:middle line:84%
If I could quote you,
"I feel I was entirely

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:84%
at the wrong end
of the spectrum.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.490 align:middle line:10%
I was treating people at the
last stages of this disease.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:10%
Most cancers start
10, 20, or 30 years

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:10%
before someone has symptoms
or gets a diagnosis.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was successful
in treating them

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.660 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the process, I
wanted to be at the beginning."

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Could you elaborate on that?

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The oncology community
as a clinical community

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:84%
is not really concerned
with the causes of cancer.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:middle line:10%
And whenever I went to meetings
and attended plenary sessions

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:10%
and lectures and went
to the prevention

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:10%
parts of the meeting,
really the discussion

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:10%
was about early detection.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And to me, early detection
is not prevention.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I
think, a big failing

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of the clinical community
to not really look

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:48.879 align:middle line:84%
at the possible
roads to prevention.

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought there was a
separation between the people

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:84%
who were doing the research
on the cellular and molecular

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.140 align:middle line:84%
level and the clinical
people who were dealing

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.435 align:middle line:90%
with cancer as a disease.

00:40:59.435 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I would like to ask you
about these five interviews

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:90%
that we've just seen.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:84%
What was it that
impressed you the most?

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all
interesting cases,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're all really
impressive people.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:10%
What struck me the most
was actually not the cancer

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.180 align:middle line:10%
cases but the Lyme
disease case, because now

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:10%
in functional medicine,
I'm dealing a lot

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.950 align:middle line:10%
with the clinical
effects of toxins.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:33.160 align:middle line:10%
So his story really struck me
now as someone who figured out,

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.940 align:middle line:10%
along with Ruth's help,
how to detox his body.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just find that extremely
fascinating and very helpful,

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.460 align:middle line:84%
because there are a lot
of people walking around

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.100 align:middle line:84%
with biotoxin illness,
and it's fairly

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.920 align:middle line:84%
straightforward, I
think, to recover,

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:90%
if you know what to do.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about cancer as
possibly a response to toxins?

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe in
detoxification as one aspect

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:90%
of preventing cancer.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very important.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And the more I become aware
of environmental issues,

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
environmental problems,
problems with our food supply,

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
the more I realize
the importance

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:25.120 align:middle line:84%
of detoxification as a natural
process, yes, but a process

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that needs help,
because we're living

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.620 align:middle line:90%
in a sea of unnatural chemicals.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was also very
impressive that almost all

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:43.226 align:middle line:84%
of the patients who pursued
this program had reactions.

00:42:43.226 --> 00:42:46.620 align:middle line:10%
It was Lou Dina,
I think, who said,

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.990 align:middle line:10%
well, I did the program
for three or four weeks,

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:50.740 align:middle line:10%
and then I definitely
felt worse.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a common
finding with any sort

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.390 align:middle line:90%
of detoxification.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:02.790 align:middle line:84%
As you start to mobilize
various environmental toxins

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and they start recirculating
in the bloodstream

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and going out into the
blood and into the stool,

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:13.980 align:middle line:90%
many patients do feel worse.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we consider that
healthy if we're not having

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:90%
symptoms.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And then when we start
to detoxify, we get sick.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is a bit of
a paradox, isn't it?

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's hard to explain
to people that feeling worse,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:36.540 align:middle line:84%
having headaches or a fever
or some type of skin reaction

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.720 align:middle line:84%
in the initial stages of a
detoxification is actually

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.400 align:middle line:84%
a helpful sign that
things are moving.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.220 align:middle line:84%
There's such a strong
tendency in modern medicine

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to try to treat every
symptom and to turn symptoms

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.420 align:middle line:90%
into diseases.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, if somebody
is having reflux,

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.880 align:middle line:84%
to put them on an acid
blocker and block the reflux.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.330 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is having
an allergic reaction

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.060 align:middle line:84%
to an environmental
irritant, to stop the mucous.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so many of our
modern medicines

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.030 align:middle line:84%
are meant to block our own
body's response, probably

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.510 align:middle line:84%
a normal response, to
an irritant or a toxin.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:23.460 align:middle line:84%
We try to squash any sort
of unpleasant symptom,

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
but it probably isn't the
best thing for the body

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.870 align:middle line:90%
to do that all of the time.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And so this phrase or
this term the healing crisis,

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.635 align:middle line:84%
that's something that I never
learned about in medical

00:44:37.635 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:90%
school.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Never heard it.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Detoxification wasn't
discussed at all.

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But do you think that
it would make sense if you

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:84%
explained it to your colleagues,
that a healing crisis is

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:59.850 align:middle line:84%
actually a valuable asset
in the healing process?

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.590 align:middle line:84%
There's so many sort of
fundamental philosophical

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:08.490 align:middle line:84%
differences between someone who
is truly conventionally trained

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and thinks conventionally
and someone like us,

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:84%
where we actually think a little
bit more like a naturopath.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole re-education
that has to take place.

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And in talking to
conventional physicians,

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.880 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to move
them to that point

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and to get them to the point to
recognize that detoxification

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is a normal and desired
purging of some kind or normal

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.830 align:middle line:90%
activation of the immune system.

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:43.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that would
be very difficult.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Rita was actually one of
your patients, wasn't she?

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, still is.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.875 align:middle line:90%
>> She still is?

00:45:48.875 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us a little
bit about your experience with

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Rita?

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Rita became a one
of my teachers, actually.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.600 align:middle line:84%
She came to me, I think
it was several years

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
after she was diagnosed
with renal cell cancer.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:11.450 align:middle line:84%
She had multiple lung nodules
at the time of diagnosis.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:15.740 align:middle line:84%
She had x-rays demonstrating
the lung nodules.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.380 align:middle line:84%
She had a path report showing
the renal cell cancer.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And then she had some
diet and lifestyle changes

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and had resolution of all
of her pulmonary nodules.

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw her, she actually
had a normal chest x-ray

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and was what we call in oncology
NED, no evidence of disease.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I once met Doris Sokosh
at one of Ruth's conferences,

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:41.390 align:middle line:10%
and I went up to her
afterwards, and I said,

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:10%
did this experience
change you in any way?

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.940 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, yes.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And also I think it was
Michal who said it's really

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.450 align:middle line:90%
a total transformation.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:00.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, when I was watching
Michal, I had that sense.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.160 align:middle line:10%
It jumped off of the
screen the strength

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:10%
that she had to walk away from
the conventional treatment

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.450 align:middle line:10%
and the certainty that
she could figure this out.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Something that Lou Dina said
in his interview is that he

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:84%
basically pointed out the
aspects of the program,

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.535 align:middle line:84%
and then he said, but you really
have to be your own doctor.

00:47:27.535 --> 00:47:31.520 align:middle line:84%
He says, it takes
a lot of resolve.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that to be
true in your patients who

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.990 align:middle line:84%
do well as compared to the ones
who maybe don't do as well?

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many patients
who really still have a very

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:49.540 align:middle line:84%
paternalistic view of medicine
where the doctor knows better

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and they just want to follow
the standard protocols,

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.170 align:middle line:90%
whatever the doctor thinks.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
other kind of patient

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that wants to be involved
in their care, wants to act,

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and in the extreme, wants
to actually find, help find

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.470 align:middle line:84%
the right care for themselves,
and maybe put together

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.830 align:middle line:84%
several different things
that they've come across.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say it's a
difference between being

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.810 align:middle line:84%
a passive patient and
being an active patient?

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And active patient
for me was a pleasure,

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:27.200 align:middle line:84%
because I really felt like I was
going on a journey with them,

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to
learn something, too.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was a different
thing each time.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And a passive patient is willing
to let things be done to them

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and then holds the medical
system responsible completely

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.810 align:middle line:90%
for the outcome.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's easier-- superficially
it might seem easier

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a passive patient,
but actually it's harder,

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:54.800 align:middle line:84%
because they will not take
any responsibility for outcome

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.600 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It's all, the success or failure
is the success or failure

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:04.730 align:middle line:84%
of your system, your
drugs, your office.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
difficult situation

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480 align:middle line:90%
to be in as a physician.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I always enjoyed the
act patients more.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And do you think fear
plays a big role in it?

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, fear is a
tremendous-- you know,

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:24.800 align:middle line:84%
leaving conventional treatment
for something that is not

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.580 align:middle line:84%
in the textbooks, none of their
friends are doing or have heard

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.380 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.560 align:middle line:84%
That's very difficult
for a patient to do.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of courage and
a lot of spirit and strength

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:36.380 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ideas that was a
core concept in Ruth's system

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.300 align:middle line:84%
is that you don't
just treat the tumor.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't just try
to kill the tumor,

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:51.890 align:middle line:84%
but you really look
at the bodily balance,

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:54.440 align:middle line:84%
the bodily condition
that created the tumor.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.770 align:middle line:84%
That is something
that is not addressed

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.520 align:middle line:90%
in conventional oncology at all.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet, for example,
we know that people

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.040 align:middle line:84%
who have had Hodgkin's
lymphoma have

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.360 align:middle line:84%
a higher incidence of developing
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Or patients who
sometimes have one type

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:14.900 align:middle line:84%
of lymphoproliferative disease
like a low-grade lymphoma

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:18.650 align:middle line:84%
can then be diagnosed with
a high-grade lymphoma.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So clearly there is
something systemic.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Patients who have
had one breast cancer

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.819 align:middle line:84%
are at increased risk
for a second cancer.

00:50:26.819 --> 00:50:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows
this, and yet there's

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:84%
no real thought or system for
dealing with risk reduction

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.940 align:middle line:90%
in any sort of real way.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that in that
sense, Ruth was very--

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Ruth's system and many of the
integrative medical systems

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:48.820 align:middle line:84%
that are out there
really do have it right,

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
all about root cause.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see a movement in
the medical establishment that

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.140 align:middle line:84%
things might be
changing, points of view,

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:03.310 align:middle line:84%
the thinking is changing,
perhaps broadening a little

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:90%
bit?

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> There are some small changes.

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I see that many
physicians, I think,

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:17.660 align:middle line:84%
are becoming wary of the
pharmaceutical industry

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and its agenda and beginning to
realize how that has dictated

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:28.210 align:middle line:84%
their agenda and
dominated their treatments

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and diagnoses over the years.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You can influence
physicians one at a time

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.989 align:middle line:84%
with very extraordinary
cases, but you also

00:51:37.989 --> 00:51:39.280 align:middle line:90%
have to work from the top down.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to have textbooks,
you have to have studies,

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:45.520 align:middle line:84%
you have to get into
medical schools,

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.122 align:middle line:84%
and you have to get
before Congress,

00:51:49.122 --> 00:51:50.830 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
change the way that we

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:51.954 align:middle line:90%
do medicine in the country.

00:51:51.954 --> 00:51:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We simply can't even afford
to do it the way that we've

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:90%
been doing it.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It is important to point
out that to heal oneself from

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:04.910 align:middle line:84%
cancer is a difficult task,
and it requires much courage,

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:08.800 align:middle line:84%
determination, and
practical knowledge.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.560 align:middle line:84%
One's chances of
success are greater

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.190 align:middle line:84%
with the help and guidance of
an experienced practitioner

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and with strong support
from family and friends.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.510 align:middle line:84%
The patient's
condition and progress

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:26.660 align:middle line:84%
must be carefully
evaluated and monitored.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We encourage
doctors and patients

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to research the work that
has been done in this area.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:38.470 align:middle line:84%
The nutritional restorative
treatment of cancer is not

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:90%
a one-size-fits-all treatment.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Each patient is a
unique individual,

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:48.235 align:middle line:84%
and the treatment must be
tailored to individual needs.

00:52:48.235 --> 00:52:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so interesting how the
body responds, and amazing,

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.080 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:02.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough faith in
the body's ability to heal.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens when
you give the body all

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:84%
of this good food and you
correct whatever is broken

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:11.250 align:middle line:90%
down and not functioning well?

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:15.120 align:middle line:84%
The body automatically
goes into play

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and does whatever it has to do
to make the correction, which

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.270 align:middle line:84%
human beings couldn't
do mechanically

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.220 align:middle line:90%
as they would like to.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The body takes over, and it
is powerful in its healing

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.550 align:middle line:90%
capacity.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:36.770 align:middle line:84%
All the research is aimed
at killing cancer cells,

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:41.360 align:middle line:84%
reducing tumor size, whether
it's with surgery, radiation,

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.250 align:middle line:90%
or chemotherapy.

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And to date, it doesn't
cure, it buys time.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I would like the
medical community,

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:56.540 align:middle line:84%
after surgery, when
surgery is appropriate,

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to start the repair program
instead of radiation

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and chemotherapy immediately,
and do that damage, which

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:05.630 align:middle line:90%
is hard to overcome.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Instead to take the body
at the safest point,

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.160 align:middle line:84%
the healthiest point,
and start the repair.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not just fruits and
vegetables that are raw.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.650 align:middle line:84%
We need protein,
we need starch, we

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:22.670 align:middle line:84%
need every element
that is necessary

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:24.890 align:middle line:90%
for health and to build cells.

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Or it's actually to build
cells which provides the help.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.040 align:middle line:84%
A healthy body with a
healthy immune system

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.570 align:middle line:84%
will automatically reject
any foreign material

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.150 align:middle line:90%
that the body has accumulated

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give
a large body of people

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:47.840 align:middle line:84%
a direction of
changing a lifestyle,

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.250 align:middle line:84%
because I believe coming
from a bad lifestyle,

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:55.160 align:middle line:90%
they need careful help.

00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:58.160 align:middle line:84%
They need some guidance
to make that change.

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.160 align:middle line:90%
It has to be made slowly.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see the
medical community change

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:10.070 align:middle line:84%
its method of treating
cancer so that every patient

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:13.790 align:middle line:84%
or any patient can go
to their local hospital,

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:20.030 align:middle line:84%
nearby, near home, and get
the kind of treatment that

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:24.710 align:middle line:84%
is required in order
to recover, instead

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:30.860 align:middle line:84%
of having to search the
internet, go to far-off places

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.180 align:middle line:90%
to get help.

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see that in every
institution in the country.
