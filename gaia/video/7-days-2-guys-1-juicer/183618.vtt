relax them when you don't.

on and keep rowing.

all the way to the finish.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:90%
and things of that nature--

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.923 align:middle line:90%
bad foods.

00:33:00.923 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while,
I will eat steak,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:90%
which I'm not supposed to--

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:90%
sweets.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You know what's so funny when
you're talking about diabetes?

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Things I should stay
away from, and I don't.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I haven't heard you say
anything about fresh fruits

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.205 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables.

00:33:14.205 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Occasionally, I do eat apples.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I will have a
salad, occasionally.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to incorporate
that more into my diet.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, doing this will
help me get a plan together.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.305 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I do eat apples.

00:33:31.305 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat enough,
put it that way.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.333 align:middle line:84%
Let's just summarize
this whole thing--

00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat enough
fruits or vegetables.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> And I should.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:48.172 align:middle line:84%
So I eat less fruits
and more bad food.

00:33:48.172 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
I should be doing.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to articulate or
elaborate on what I eat.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.841 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's just all
bad foods, that's all.

00:34:00.841 --> 00:34:01.641 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of processed stuff.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Correct, yes--
processed stuff, frozen.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going in
the supermarket--

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.332 align:middle line:84%
and I guess produce is
always to your left.

00:34:10.332 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's to your right.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.207 align:middle line:84%
But instead of going
to that department,

00:34:13.207 --> 00:34:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I end up swaying
to the other areas.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Breads-- you go and
get your breads instead

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:90%
of getting more vegetables.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.949 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough
vegetables in my diet.

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a huge link
between weight and health.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- when
they think about obesity,

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:84%
or weight and health--
tends to think about, oh,

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
if I'm heavier,
I'll have increased

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:84%
risk of heart disease,
increased risk of diabetes.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But the link is
really much deeper.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Close to a quarter of
cancers in the United States

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:04.940 align:middle line:84%
are being attributed to diet,
and obesity, and inactivity.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.120 align:middle line:84%
When you have fat
around your middle,

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.930 align:middle line:84%
that fat creates a
huge inflammatory risk.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
inflammation, you

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:84%
have higher rates of depression,
higher rates of cancer,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and higher rates of a
multitude of illnesses.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:84%
If nothing is done about
the current obesity problem,

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.690 align:middle line:90%
how bad could it get?

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I would say we've
already gotten to a point

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:90%
that it's pretty bad.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:38.374 align:middle line:90%

maybe work for IBM, or Google,
or something like that--

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and eventually learn
how to develop apps

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and work for myself.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.920 align:middle line:90%
I've actually got a direction.

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.310 align:middle line:84%
My mind is clear enough
because of the juice

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that I'm able to really
think and focus on stuff.

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If I can do this,
I can do anything.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Just try a juice a day.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.495 align:middle line:84%
Increase that to
maybe two juices a day

00:51:25.495 --> 00:51:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and three juices later--

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:28.740 align:middle line:90%
baby steps.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Work their way into juicing.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if you just do one
meal, if it's just breakfast.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Especially breakfast-- you
get your day started off good.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.030 align:middle line:90%
It makes it easier.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:44.067 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that, when you do,

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:45.400 align:middle line:90%
it makes you want to do it more.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Just that one just makes
you want to juice more,

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:51.950 align:middle line:84%
because you get that nice,
good, energetic feeling.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Just keep trying.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to do
something consecutively,

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and you fall off track,
just get right back on track

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.090 align:middle line:90%
and just keep going.

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And keep attempting to do it.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you'll
get it together.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.942 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:06.942 --> 00:52:47.475 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.475 --> 00:52:49.850 align:middle line:84%
One other thing-- once I got
my weight down a little bit,

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.538 align:middle line:90%
I went to Express.

00:52:52.538 --> 00:52:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, aw,
man, I don't know

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.620 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to be able
to fit in something.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was down enough.

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I was in the biggest size,
but I was back in there.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a while
where I wasn't in there at all.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even that those
army t-shirts that I wore--

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.760 align:middle line:84%
when I wear those
now, it's just--

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I've still got some of those,
but it's getting so big.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:21.430 align:middle line:90%
