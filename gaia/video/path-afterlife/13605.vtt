00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Life is a journey.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We are born.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Our lives are lived.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Then we die.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:90%
No one can live forever.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Or can they?

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The goal of this film
is to try to understand

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.050 align:middle line:84%
the basic fundamental questions,
what happens when we die?

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose of life?

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
As we set out to
find the answers,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
we began to see that we were
on a journey, an adventure.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Like any journey, we
discovered we were on a path.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
To help answer
these questions, we

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.685 align:middle line:84%
set out to talk to 12 experts
in the field of energy

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:47.435 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Do I, this thing I
know as me right now,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:90%
survive physical death?

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Meaning all of my memories,
all of my experiences,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
all of my friends, all
of the relationships I've

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
built, the last person I make
love to, will all of that

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:90%
go with me when I leave?

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:90%
And so there's two things there.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Either it's lights out.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Or the thing I know
as me continues.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think the answer
lies in just two things.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>I use an analogy of a train
ride where all of humanity,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
6 and 1/2 billion of
us, are on this train.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're all heading to
this unknown destination.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're on this
75 year journey.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And think how insane this is.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
We're all collectively on
this journey for 75 years.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have a
clue where we're going.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, would that be acceptable
in any aspect of your life now?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Would you leave the house
and not have a destination?

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we wouldn't accept
that on a day-to-day basis.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
But yet we're accepting that
for our entire life journey.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>I have a feeling that
it's like taking off

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
old clothes that
don't work anymore,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:84%
clothes that don't
fit you any longer.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:90%
You just let go of the body.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.086 align:middle line:84%
And what's left is the real
you, your spirit, your soul.

00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:53.846 align:middle line:90%

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The place where I
would like to begin

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:90%
was when I was seven years old.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:90%
And my father died.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:90%
He had a massive heart attack.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And he never came home.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that was when
my spiritual journey

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.665 align:middle line:90%
began, when I was seven.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's at
least 42 years ago.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to know where he was.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Why did he leave?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'd ask a lot of
questions, lot of questions,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to my grandmother, who
was very spiritual.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
She would say to me, don't
ask so many questions.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
make yourself crazy.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
But I would ask
questions quietly.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I never felt that
my father was gone.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else cried
except for myself.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was crying.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.055 align:middle line:90%
I felt like he was still there.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:90%
And he was.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>My first experience
in really being

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
able to see where a soul may
go was when my mother died.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.855 align:middle line:84%
My mother and I always had
this psychic connection

00:03:57.855 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:84%
even though she
lived in Florida.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.441 align:middle line:90%
And I was up here.

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
She would play solitaire
at 4:00 in the morning.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be doing my cards.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:90%
We just had this connection.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And right before she became
really ill, I kind of knew it.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.141 align:middle line:84%
She didn't ever want
to know that you

00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:90%
could know these things.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
It was too
superstitious for her.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
But when she passed,
I wasn't with her.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:90%
She was in the South.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
She was in the South
having her funeral.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And then she was coming
up for another funeral.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
The night that they
burned her ashes,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it at
the time, but I dreamt.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:90%
And I saw her.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.245 align:middle line:84%
And she was in her
apartment in Florida.

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And she was looking
in her apartment.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.390 align:middle line:84%
She went all the
way in the stairs

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:84%
where you do your laundry,
walked around, walked around.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:90%
And then I saw this light.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.122 align:middle line:84%
And the light
overtook all of me.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
most sweet feeling

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I've ever felt in my life,
of sweet, sweet love.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.795 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:00.642 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what that was.

00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing to me.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So after that time, I started
reading, started reading

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Kubler-Ross, and, again,
trying to put things together

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:90%
to say what just happened.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first experience
realizing that when you die,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.846 align:middle line:84%
there's this
beautiful thing that

00:05:19.846 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:90%
happens, which I didn't know.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:90%
She taught me that.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:90%
She showed me that.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was her gift to me.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>It's been my experience
that before we transition,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.975 align:middle line:84%
our guides and spirit guides and
whatever else we believe exist

00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:38.683 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
begins our preparation.

00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:42.345 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
When I work with people
or I'm around people,

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I see very clearly a
white light around people

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
before they're
ready to transition.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It's happened to me
several times in my life.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I saw it around my grandfather
before he passed away.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I had a conversation
with him, he knew what it was.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And he knew it was
his time to go.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.149 align:middle line:84%
And it surprised him
that I could see it.

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
it was at that time.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time that
that had happened specifically

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.255 align:middle line:84%
so close to somebody
transitioning.

00:06:09.255 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very
clear, the white light

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:90%
that was around him.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And he died five days later,
passed away five days later.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.445 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it a handful
of times since.

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly around people
who are terminally ill

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%
or are just elderly.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it around people
before something tragic happens

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
But I do see it
around people who

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:84%
are at the end of
their life spans.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Once I went into the
intensive care unit

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and I worked more deeply
in the psychic world,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I was able to be around
people who were dying

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and see where they went.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.872 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Because during this
period of time,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty much with
everyone who died.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:90%
I got assigned to them.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And if I wasn't assigned to
them, the head nurse would say,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
would you go help
Mary in room nine?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And that person
was about to die.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So I was meant to
do this for awhile.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
This one person that died,
which was really quite amazing,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:90%
was a composer.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.375 align:middle line:84%
And it was change of shifts
so the night shift and day

00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:90%
shift were there.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And we happened to be
with him as he was dying.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were used
to me by that time.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, everybody,
hold hands around him.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:90%
And I heard his soul.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:32.416 align:middle line:84%
And he became the music that
he played his whole life.

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:34.676 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:07:34.676 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
He became the music.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
That's who he was in
his most unified self.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>When I am sleeping,
often souls come to me.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The soul of my father-in-law,
who passed on some years ago,

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
came to me in a dream about
six months after he passed.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
wonderful experience.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I missed him terribly,
loved the man dearly.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And he came to tell me that he
understood and that he loved me

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and that he was
going on his way.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Often that happens
to me where I get

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
to confer with someone
who is no longer here.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have
something to tell me.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's so wonderful
to get those messages.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>When my father, who
I was very close with,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.276 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful, wonderful
being, had passed away,

00:08:32.276 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is around
the time where

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of getting
guided, pushed, and shoved

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to move away from anesthesia
and keep going on my journey.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was still working.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was still trying to
move through this life.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a great deal
of pain and self-hate,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
huge self-hatred, felt
completely worthless.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very hard.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And I finally hit what
you would call, I suppose,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.267 align:middle line:90%
a dark night of the soul.

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Something just spoke through me.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And I set out in my room.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I spoke out and said,
God, I need help.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I'm a bad person.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
But I can't take this anymore.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And I need help.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was crying and
pounding my fists.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:90%
And I went to sleep.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've dreamt
a lot in my life.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
like a movie set,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
lots of characters,
lots going on.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
In this dream, it was
like white screen.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And my dad showed up from
stage left, tie, jacket,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
looking very dapper
and quite alive.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.635 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:09:41.635 --> 00:09:45.043 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Daddy, you're dead.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.059 align:middle line:90%
I said it very quietly.

00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't
want anyone to know.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.183 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to
hang out with him.

00:09:49.183 --> 00:09:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I know.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And he called me Booper, which
is what he used to call me.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no,
but you're dead.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I know.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And we hung out.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
remember what was said.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I know he held me.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, I knew
it was time to complete.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so if things get
really, really bad again,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:90%
will you help me?

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Can you come to me?

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah, sure.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And I work up the next day.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And my entire energy
and mind was shifted.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I was facing,
within a day or two, completely

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:90%
resolved.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>I did have an experience with
my mother after she passed.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It was a year
after she had died.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And I kept getting
guidance to call my message

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:90%
machine at home.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:90%
And I called.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And my mother's voice was
on my answering machine.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And she just kept
saying my name over.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was so much out of
my paradigm at that time,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.252 align:middle line:84%
and it totally shocked
me, that I erased it.

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
learned that there

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
are people who claim to have
experiences with contact

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
of people on the other
side through fax machines,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
through computers, through all
kinds of technological devices.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of opened
something up for me.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
I went, that was
not my imagination.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going to hold that
as a little piece to go forward

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>I had, for instance,
an experience

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
of finding myself, moving
along in this other dimension.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And I say moving.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.617 align:middle line:84%
Was I in my body
or out of my body?

00:11:29.617 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.756 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't significant
to me at the time.

00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:90%
But I found myself moving along.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And off to my left,
all of a sudden,

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
there were these
beings of light.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were gathered
around in a circle.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:90%
And I almost went right by them.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of, oh,
well, that's something.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.924 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that every day.

00:11:52.924 --> 00:11:54.632 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I'd go
over and investigate.

00:11:54.632 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I peeked
over the shoulder

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:90%
of one of these light people.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:90%
And I looked down.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And there was some guy down
there that had obviously

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:84%
just crossed over
from being dead,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
from going through
the process, and now

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
was on the other
side of something.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know where I was.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
The closer I looked
though, the more

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I realized that that person that
was down there was my father.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, my father had
died about seven years

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
before that of
Alzheimer's disease.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And he had gone through a
process of gradual degradation.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:90%
He was a brilliant guy.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
tough to watch him

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
lose so much of his essence, to
the point where he didn't even

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
recognize us anymore
for the most part.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I was with him the
night that he died.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I whispered to him the
night that he was clearly

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:90%
passing away.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, Dad, when
you get to the other side,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:84%
will you come back and
tell me what it's like?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was just one
of those moments

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.477 align:middle line:90%
of a little bit of clarity.

00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:10.310 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And he nodded.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I never would have
dreamed that I might actually

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
be in a position to be welcoming
him over to the other side.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.946 align:middle line:90%
But yet here I was.

00:13:25.946 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:90%
I was looking at him.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And I instinctively
picked him up in my arms.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And I started carrying him.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling him that,
Dad, now you've passed over

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and that your family's
going to come and get you.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And it just seem so natural.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, I never would
have dreamed that any of this

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:90%
would be possible.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have made
it up if I'd tried.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And after awhile, the
beings of light came.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And they took him away from me.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
his family is coming.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:90%
And he's going to be all right.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:90%
And we can care for him now.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of
that experience

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
so-- there aren't words to
talk about something like that.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you try to tell
somebody about death.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't there.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's just words.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But to me it was so
profound in so many ways.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it wrapped
up so much emotion

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that I had around his
Alzheimer's and seeing

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%
him pass.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It opened up the possibility
that maybe the range

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
of experience in
the physical world

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
is not so separate
from the world beyond

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and that maybe we
have capacities

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:84%
of moving between those
two worlds in ways

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that, unfortunately, we
maybe knew at one time.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:84%
But we've lost the
capacity to do that.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>My wife has had actually
many profound out-of-body

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.855 align:middle line:84%
The day her father died,
she was on the couch.

00:15:02.855 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:90%
She was exhausted.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Her mother called
her and told her.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:90%
We're in another state.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story
short, this is about 2 o'clock

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And she lays down.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:84%
We had just made a
flight to go back

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to Baltimore to
attend the funeral.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.596 align:middle line:90%
She lays down.

00:15:22.596 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:84%
The next thing
she knows, she has

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.390 align:middle line:84%
this spontaneous
out-of-body experience.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And she finds herself in her
basement of her mother's house.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And there is her father there
with, of all people, my mother.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And her father, who was
very sickly, couldn't walk,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:90%
was in very bad shape.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:90%
He was dying of cancer.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
He literally jumped up
and clicked his heels,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
she said, and was showing her
how vibrant and alive he was.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
He was proving to her that,
look, don't grieve for me.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling great.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
out-of-body, people

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:90%
communicate not by words.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
They communicate by
thought transference.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just normal communication.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, he communicated
his love for his daughter.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, he
was making it very clear

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:90%
that he was doing great.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was glad to
be where he was.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And my mother and
my wife's father

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:90%
were basically having a party.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
For lack of a better
word, they were

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
having a party, a
very joyous party.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife, after
that, she immediately

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:84%
come back and was
like, oh my God.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
But all the fear-based
ideas just were gone.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.980 align:middle line:90%
She was just ecstatic.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a confirmation to her
that everything is just not

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:90%
only good, it's great.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.653 align:middle line:84%
Her concept of death was just
so negative, so restrictive.

00:16:58.653 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:84%
There's very few positives in
our culture attached to death.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And here she learned, I
think, a valuable lesson

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:90%
that it's not a negative event.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a very positive event.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:90%
It's an uplifting event.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
He was free from the pain
of this physical body.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was finally
free to enjoy himself.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:28.037 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I thought it was
quite a remarkable experience.

00:17:28.037 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it must
have been a great lesson

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that she needed on some level.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>My uncle had cancer.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.609 align:middle line:90%
And I offered to send him Reiki.

00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:90%
He lived in Poughkeepsie.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And I lived in Saratoga.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I offered to send
him Reiki every day.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And we agreed on 8
o'clock in the morning.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.030 align:middle line:84%
8 o'clock in the morning, he
sat down in his living room.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I sat down in my Reiki room.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And I sent him Reiki.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:90%
He was an engineer.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The stuff didn't particularly
make sense to him.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It was fine.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:90%
He liked it.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't really
sure much was happening.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But he was willing to sit and
let me send him Reiki every day

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:90%
at 8 o'clock.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So we met at 8
o'clock in the ethers.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And I sent him Reiki.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:90%
This started in August.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
In November, I sat down
to send them Reiki.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
For three days in a
row, I felt so ecstatic.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling such euphoria.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:90%
I was convinced he was healing.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.954 align:middle line:84%
A few days later,
one of my cousins

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
called to say that they had
just been to the doctor.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And dad had six months to live.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.540 align:middle line:90%
I was confounded.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
But I was so sure some
healing had happened.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:90%
And then I remembered.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Healing isn't always physical.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So I thought something
healed for him.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Then in January, he
was in the hospital.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:90%
He was very ill.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Poughkeepsie.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was giving him Reiki in
the ICU, quite late at night.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:90%
And he was dosing.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And then he'd wake.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And we'd chat a little bit.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And I felt comfortable
to tell him

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:84%
what I had experienced
in November.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
During this time
when I was feeling

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:84%
this ecstasy and this euphoria,
I heard his wife's laughter.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:90%
She had died three years before.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:90%
He adored his wife.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was hearing her laughter.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And it was so exciting.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:90%
And I told him about this.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.890 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was soaking
up something wonderful.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So even though he
said that he didn't

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
feel Reiki when I sent it
to him from a distance,

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
at that time something
changed for him.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And he died.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Healing doesn't mean curing.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Healing can be spiritual.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:90%
It can be emotional.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It can be psychological.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.275 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
healed for him.

00:20:07.275 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:90%
But something did.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And the gift he gave
me was telling me

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:84%
he knew something
good had happened.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
His daughter and I liked to
talk about our understanding

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:90%
of metaphysics.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So we would tell him things
that we'd been reading

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and what we thought might
happen for him when he passed.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:90%
And he listened.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.822 align:middle line:90%
He always was open to listening.

00:20:34.822 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make sense
to him particularly.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.571 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even tell us
that it didn't make sense.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Three days after
he died, I sat down

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:90%
to meditate in my Reiki room.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:90%
And I closed my eyes.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if he was
right there in front of me.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It was very real.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to tell you,
everything you and Betsy said,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make any sense to me.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:90%
But you were right.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him with
his beloved wife.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:84%
They were all dressed up like
they were going to a party.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were in the
prime of their life.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.842 align:middle line:90%
They looked beautiful.

00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:84%
They had their arms around
each other's waists.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.216 align:middle line:84%
And they were
spinning in a circle

00:21:19.216 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:90%
with their heads thrown back.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was a picture
of utter bliss.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:90%
What a gift he gave me.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very sweet.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I believe there is
life after death in some form.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Whether it includes bodies
or not, I don't know.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I think I saw their
bodies because that's

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:90%
how I perceived energy.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:84%
That was something that
I would understand.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So it was given to
me in that form.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>If you can love the memory
of a parent and that helps you

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you solace,
then that's beautiful.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But you are not separate
from that being.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And you do not require
that being in order

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to be your true essence
and your true self.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>No one is ever truly
separate from anyone else.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a wonderful
thing to know?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't lose anybody.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>According to a Gallup
poll, approximately 8 million

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Americans claim to have had
a near-death experience.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Lindsey Sass, a wife and
mother of two children,

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
is a woman who had a near-death
experience after she was struck

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
by lightning on July 19, 1997
in Greenwood Lake, New Jersey.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Myself, my ex-husband, and
my niece, all three of us,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
were struck at the same
time at my son's swim meet.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Luckily, I landed on the grass.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:90%
My husband was on the street.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:90%
He landed on his head.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:90%
He was screaming in pain.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>And I saw my niece there.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:90%
She was flat out.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I thought she was gone.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Over the last 30
years, the United States

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:84%
has averaged 62 reported
lightning fatalities per year.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>I had had a heart attack.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The pain was incredible that
was searing across my chest.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:90%
And a man had run over to me.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.769 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't breathe.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't talk.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you were
struck by lightning.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:84%
When my senses
started to come back,

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.277 align:middle line:90%
I said to him, help me up.

00:23:25.277 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no, no.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Lay there.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.407 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move my right arm.

00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I had some movement
in my right leg.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I could move it
enough to stand up.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But my right arm,
I couldn't move.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:90%
The chest was numb.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.655 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it was very intense.

00:23:40.655 --> 00:23:42.905 align:middle line:84%
There was a lightning streak,
like you see in the sky,

00:23:42.905 --> 00:23:45.740 align:middle line:84%
up my right arm
where it had entered.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:90%
So he lifted me up.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But as a mother would do when
she sees her children may not

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
have anything, any
love or protection,

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:84%
your adrenaline starts to pump
as if you could lift a car off

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:90%
of your child.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There was something very
mysterious going on.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:90%
There were so many angels.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
There were so many, hundreds of
them that I could comprehend.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And then I went.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.527 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the
car with this woman.

00:24:15.527 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And I turned to her.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's OK.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:90%
The angels are with us.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:90%
I found myself in the car.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The paramedics, who were some
parents on the swim team,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
came up and told me
just to rest and relax.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It was very incredible.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
After I was struck by
lightning, the veil

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
between the physical world
and the spiritual world

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:90%
seemed to have disappeared.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>A near-death experience
is the sensation

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:84%
of detachment from
one's body, the presence

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of a tunnel of light,
the apparent viewing

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
of one's own body from on high,
and similar manifestations,

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:84%
experienced by people
whose heart and brain

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
have temporarily
ceased to function.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>The spiritual experience
of the near-death,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
in words, because
it's so, so profound.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.510 align:middle line:84%
The English language, or the
language of the human being,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have the
right vocabulary

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:90%
to describe it enough.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>During a near-death
experience,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.910 align:middle line:84%
the physical body
is temporarily dead.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
It's often for less than
two or three minutes.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:90%
But the heart may stop.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
make this clear.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experience
involves the termination

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.710 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>When you die, you go
into a reality frame

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:84%
that's not the
same as the dream.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same as
really the out-of-body.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
You go into this reality
frame that was made especially

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
for people who are just
transitioning from this reality

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
frame to another, because these
people have special needs.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:90%
They're very confused.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Everything went black.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I felt myself floating
out of my body.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I felt this tremendous
space of void, of emptiness,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:90%
of total nothingness.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>So you die.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you're
someplace else.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like going to
sleep in your bed

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.855 align:middle line:84%
and waking up in a foreign
country, in a strange house.

00:26:09.855 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:90%
It's that kind of a thing.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So you tend to be a little
stressed and a little confused.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>As I was floating
out, I saw my father,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:90%
who died when I was seven.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I recognized his
smile, his energy.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:90%
I felt I knew it was him.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And he guided me
towards the light.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>And in that reality frame,
you may be met by loved ones.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You may have all
those things going on.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt myself
floating up and out.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And he was guiding me.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I saw thousands of lost
spirits, thousands of them.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:48.046 align:middle line:84%
And I felt totally connected to
them, as if they were family.

00:26:48.046 --> 00:26:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I felt their loneliness
and their lostness.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>A lost soul is the
disembodied spirit

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of a dead human who is unable
to function in the spirit world

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:90%
without help.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of them either had a
traumatic death experience,

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
died in battle or
died in an accident

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:90%
or in a fire or something.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Many of them don't
make it to the light.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Or they feel like they have
unfinished business here.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So they can't quite
allow themselves

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond where
they're stuck.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's a lack of
no one has ever said to them,

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90%
there is life after death.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So they don't really
look for anything else.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>I was feeling the peace.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was pulling me up.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:90%
I was not lost.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I already had my
spiritual belief systems

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:84%
before I was struck
by lightning.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you have a very
strong belief system this way,

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that belief system will become
a hook by which they will

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
manipulate you to get you to
relax and let go and go on.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>There was a conference.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And we discussed
what was going on.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And they brought my
attention down to my body.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>You get taken to almost
like group sessions

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.221 align:middle line:84%
where things are
explained to you.

00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
tell you something

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that makes you feel better,
that lets you relax,

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
that lets you get the
idea that now you're

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:84%
aware in this different
reality system.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>They explained to me, through
energy and thought form,

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that it would be very
difficult on my ex-husband, who

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%
was my husband at that
time-- now my ex-husband--

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
that it would be very difficult
for him if I didn't go back.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I still felt some resistance.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
no physical pain.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:90%
There is no emotional pain.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Out there, I
call it out there.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't feel the physical
body holding us back.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no denseness
of the physical body.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>I saw my body in
this contorted position

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
on the ground under
this very large tree,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.980 align:middle line:84%
which attracted the
lightning, and still

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:84%
was resisting going
back into my body.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.725 align:middle line:84%
And then they brought
my attention again.

00:29:12.725 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And we talked, as I remember
it through thought forms,

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:84%
about my children,
my three-year-old,

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:84%
who was in the car alone,
and my 11-year-old,

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:90%
who was on the dock.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:90%
So I came back.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I saw a large vortex,
a tunnel coming down.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this
tug, like there was

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:90%
a silver cord to my stomach.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Once I was in that energy
field, I remember thinking,

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
how fast I am
moving through this.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
There was no going back.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's still difficult
for me to talk about this.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Because I was home.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:90%
That was home.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is a place, I have
found, that we come to visit.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>So it really is whatever is in
your mind, your state of mind,

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.640 align:middle line:84%
at the point of leaving
your body is really

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:84%
going to determine what
happens next for you.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:90%
But there is no death really.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the soul is
an eternal thing.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Once you move from what we
might call believing that,

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
because I read it in a book or
I heard an inspirational speaker

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:84%
one time or I went
to church every day,

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:84%
once you go from believing
that to knowing that,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
your fear of loss of the
physical body simply vanishes.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>This body sitting here
is not all there is to me.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:90%
I do have a mental body.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.740 align:middle line:84%
It's where all the
thoughts come in.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I have an emotional body
where all the feelings exist.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:90%
I have a physical body.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I also have extensions
of myself in other places

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:90%
and other planes.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:84%
We are much more
than we appear to be.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:90%
That I know for sure.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Once you answer the
question for yourself,

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:84%
again, I am more
than my physical body

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and not say, well,
what is it then?

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.095 align:middle line:90%
Are you this?

00:31:14.095 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Are you this?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Just experience for
yourself that very notion,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I am more than my physical body.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Because at a core, heart
level, a knowing level,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:90%
I am more than this.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:90%
The loss of this means nothing.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Lindsey's near-death
experience showed us we are

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.070 align:middle line:84%
more than our physical bodies,
which may lead one to believe

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness lives
on and cannot be destroyed.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
This gives hope that
there is something more

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.872 align:middle line:84%
after we leave
the physical body.

00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Call it spirit.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.332 align:middle line:90%
Call it soul.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Call it consciousness or energy.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:90%
It will continue forever.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:07.847 align:middle line:84%
>>Everything is made up of
energy, absolutely everything.

00:32:07.847 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>When we talk about
life after death,

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.660 align:middle line:84%
what we're really
talking about is energy.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the energy that we

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
are that comes
into consciousness

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and forms itself into a
being in order to heal.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>The word "energy" comes up as
a grand explanation in healing,

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
in an explanation
of the universe.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, this is very
slow moving molecules.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:90%
None of this is solid.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>So my experience of my hand
as solid, it isn't really.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just my
experience of my hand.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's a grand
understanding and a way

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
in which we can explain it
to ourselves in our heads.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Physical form
breaks down to energy.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.810 align:middle line:84%
We're all energy
at a basic level.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:90%
So energy doesn't die.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It just simply changes form.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>People would say, well,
that's life after death.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not so
much life after death.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just life continuing.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It was just conscious
to begin with.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It's still consciousness
afterwards.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:84%
The death thing is
just a point of view.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just looking at a
particular data set and rule

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:19.830 align:middle line:90%
set.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness
doesn't really

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:90%
die and get reborn or anything.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.095 align:middle line:90%
The consciousness is continuous.

00:33:25.095 --> 00:33:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It just continues on.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just now in a
different reality frame.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:90%
So you just switch frames.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>If it's lights out, so what?

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.505 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
going to be there worrying

00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:39.820 align:middle line:90%
that it's lights out.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.320 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I told you it's all dark.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing here.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.236 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're there
thinking about that, well then,

00:33:47.236 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:84%
you're still there
thinking about that.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>When you let go
of this character

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that you're playing in
this virtual reality

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.266 align:middle line:84%
is that your awareness returns
to a larger reality that's

00:34:00.266 --> 00:34:01.557 align:middle line:90%
not as constrained as this one.

00:34:01.557 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:10.179 align:middle line:84%
>>My kids used to ask me, Daddy,
what is it like when you die?

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:84%
I mean that,
obviously, is something

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that comes up with your children
when they're growing up.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And my answer to
them was, imagine

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.040 align:middle line:90%
you're dreaming at night.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And you have a dream life
about you're doing this.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:90%
You're running.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're playing and
so forth and so on.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when you wake up
here in the morning, what

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
happened to that
person in the dream?

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
everything that went on?

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.889 align:middle line:84%
If time passes, do
you even remember

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:90%
what the dream was about?

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:90%
And they would say, no.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:48.994 align:middle line:84%
Or I remember I was
and uh-- [SIGHS].

00:34:48.994 --> 00:34:50.929 align:middle line:90%
Gee, I can't remember now.

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:90%
It was really a neat dream.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But I just can't
quite remember it.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's what
dying is going to be like.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>All the details, they just
kind of melt away like a dream.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you wake up
on that other side,

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:84%
this lifetime, this
experience packet,

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:90%
starts to fade like a dream.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's fairly clear at first.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But the further you get away
from it, the dreamier it gets.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of fades away.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>But for the most
part, you'll become

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:90%
involved in wherever you are.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you
wake up at night

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:84%
from your nighttime
dreams, you wake up here.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And those things just go away.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And you're into your day.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And that occupies
who and what you are.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>When you die,
people think, oh, I'll

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:90%
go meet up with Uncle Fred.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:90%
And he and I were buddies.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, Uncle Fred's moved on.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:84%
After Uncle Fred's been gone for
a pretty short period of time,

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.960 align:middle line:84%
all of the details of
this life just go away.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:55.560 align:middle line:84%
He's not sitting around pining
over things that happened here.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:90%
People have a hard time.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:84%
They think, well, my children,
my wife, my lover, we

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
want to go on forever.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not like that.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:90%
You can have those memories.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.097 align:middle line:90%
They're memories.

00:36:07.097 --> 00:36:07.930 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:08.980 align:middle line:90%
It's in your data.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it's lost.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>And you might remember a
few really important things

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:90%
that went on here.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>The big picture stuff you
did, the things you did right,

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and the things you did
wrong, that stuff sticks out.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that's stuff to work
on or to get lessons from.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>But we're standing
inside the system

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.233 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to explain.

00:36:27.233 --> 00:36:29.928 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.928 --> 00:36:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not so sure
that we aren't

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
trapped by our own
limited observations.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:43.380 align:middle line:84%
How can we get outside of
this system to explain it?

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:49.270 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
issues that many people

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.035 align:middle line:84%
have with the quantum
mechanical explanation of things

00:36:52.035 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:84%
is because we're
inside the system

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain the
system of which we are part.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.955 align:middle line:84%
We, as scientists, cannot be
separate from the experiment

00:37:00.955 --> 00:37:01.455 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:37:01.455 --> 00:37:04.710 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.585 align:middle line:84%
>>Most people have had
a person in their life

00:37:06.585 --> 00:37:09.000 align:middle line:84%
die or know someone
who is grieving

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.250 align:middle line:90%
the loss of a loved one.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So how do we go on
after someone dies?

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Why does it have to happen?

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Is our death preplanned
before we're born?

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Is there a life plan?

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe death is not an
accident or tragedy

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.760 align:middle line:84%
but happens specifically
for certain reasons.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.010 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>The old saying is,
oh, someone died?

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:90%
There's someone coming in.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm just in awe of
how the universe is

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:84%
able to hold us and create
and destroy and create

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and destroy and hold that
with love the whole time.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:56.302 align:middle line:84%
>>In 2005, there were 2,448,000
deaths in the United States.

00:37:56.302 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:84%
In that same year, there
were 4,140,000 births

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't like the word "death."

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
it exists really.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's been my experience,
too, that death is final.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
anything is final.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Nothing in nature is final.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps transitioning
into some other form.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>But it's a continuation,
like the physical world,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:90%
in many ways, for most people.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
evolution of the person

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.563 align:middle line:84%
and how, let's
just say, attached

00:38:30.563 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:84%
they are to their
old form-based image.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a sad thing
to lose somebody.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:90%
It's emotional.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a tragic thing.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But you have to kind of
step back eventually,

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
when there's been
enough healing done,

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and think about the things
that it has taught you.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:84%
There is always a lesson
in something, always.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just about digging
deep enough to find it.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Last year, I was diagnosed
with severe blood clots.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And they went to my lungs.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was admitted into the
ICU for a period of time.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
the worst cases

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.907 align:middle line:84%
the doctors had
seen in a long time.

00:39:06.907 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that I basically
wasn't going to make it.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.360 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I had
going for me was my age.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So when I sat there
and they said to me,

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.384 align:middle line:84%
you have 48 hours,
48 or 72 hours.

00:39:19.384 --> 00:39:20.300 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be it.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.591 align:middle line:90%
You're either going to make it.

00:39:21.591 --> 00:39:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Or you're not.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.880 align:middle line:90%
It was very black and white.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a very interesting and
life-changing point for me.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Here I am in the ICU with the
tubes and things attached.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And family coming in and
crying and just very emotional

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that, at
that particular moment,

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely had to stay
in the present moment.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.550 align:middle line:84%
If I went out of the present
moment into the future,

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.710 align:middle line:84%
worrying about my children's
future without me there,

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:90%
my vibration would lower.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And I would get worse.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:59.220 align:middle line:90%
My vitals would change.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:84%
If I went into the past,
which I did have to do.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest with you.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.830 align:middle line:90%
I did have to go into the past.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I did have
to come to terms

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:13.290 align:middle line:84%
with my experiences of
life up until that point.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And I made a definite
decision at that point

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to die
consciously, if it was my time.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of having these
conversations with spirit

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:84%
at that time where I had
just been to Egypt six months

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.660 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And it had become
very clear to me

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that part of my life destiny,
my life plan so to speak,

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.220 align:middle line:84%
was to bring groups
of people back

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.600 align:middle line:84%
to experience these
places around the world.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And so why now,
six months later,

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.260 align:middle line:84%
spirit, are you
asking me to leave?

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make any sense to me.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But at that
particular moment what

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:59.340 align:middle line:84%
was most evident at that point,
if it were my time to go,

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that it was the experiences
that I remembered.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.530 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't who I've studied.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.872 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't my accomplishments.

00:41:06.872 --> 00:41:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what I had
done material-wise.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:84%
It was what had
I done on a level

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:84%
where I was present
in my relationships?

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It was about, who have I loved?

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Who have I
experienced life with?

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You shed things that
you have probably

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.210 align:middle line:84%
held on to your entire
life when you're

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:90%
faced with your own death.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I made a promise and a pact
with spirit at that time

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:39.020 align:middle line:90%
that, OK, I'm going to stay.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.360 align:middle line:90%
I was very determined.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to stay.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
what I have to do here.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's important
for everybody,

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.640 align:middle line:84%
whether you're faced
with death or not.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:90%
You wake up every day.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.890 align:middle line:90%
You go to work.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:53.840 align:middle line:90%
You pay your bills.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.720 align:middle line:90%
You come home.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:90%
You watch TV.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.440 align:middle line:90%
You go to sleep.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're here for?

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that what your destiny is?

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I think every single human
being on the face of this earth

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:90%
has a plan, has a purpose.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's divine.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
When we lose
somebody tragically,

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.530 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to understand
how that would be a lesson

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and how that would
be a good thing.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily that
the event itself is good.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But the lessons that
it takes us through,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:84%
we can't experience
necessarily any other way.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>I think illnesses can be
an opportunity for change,

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.250 align:middle line:90%
an opportunity for learning.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.960 align:middle line:84%
They could be challenges
that sometimes

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:84%
occur because we
haven't listened

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to the less extreme signals
that have given us opportunities

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:90%
for learning the same things.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Many times children who
come into this world who

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.730 align:middle line:84%
die of cancer in
their childhood,

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:00.930 align:middle line:84%
they often were souls that
volunteered for that so

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that the people around them
would learn compassion,

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
would learn to get
together for a common good.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Picking a particular
set of parents

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is maybe more complex than we
can comprehend with the brains

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.750 align:middle line:90%
we have right here.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
that that's probably

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:84%
part of that, of that making
those decisions about who

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.300 align:middle line:84%
you're born to and why
you're born that way

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
experiences you're having.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that many
times within a family,

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.280 align:middle line:84%
when there is a
tragic death, there

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.030 align:middle line:84%
is something to be learned
by the other family members.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They learn to value
each other more.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.170 align:middle line:84%
They learn things
about compassion.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They learn things
about forgiveness

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
learn any other way.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the hard lessons
that we often learn.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.860 align:middle line:84%
We learn best by
stumbling and falling.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
We learn best by
the painful things

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that we go through, not by the
sunny days and the flowers.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Maybe there is a lesson in
everything we experience here.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The experiences may be
our opportunity to grow,

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.010 align:middle line:90%
which sometimes means death.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Death may be the best
teacher in our life.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:84%
The idea of soul
contracts may be a new way

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to look at death as our
ally rather than our enemy.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>I read a book years ago by
Neale Donald Walsch called

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:90%
"The Little Soul and the Sun."

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's about a little soul
that's up in heaven with God

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and wants to come
to Earth and wants

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.340 align:middle line:90%
to experience forgiveness.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And another little
soul says, I love

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:45.320 align:middle line:84%
you enough to go
to Earth with you

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.330 align:middle line:90%
and give you this experience.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So I will have to take on
darkness and heaviness.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I will not
remember who I am.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But I will give you
something to forgive.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.320 align:middle line:90%
In that instant, I healed.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I recognized the truth in
that, that the people who

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.000 align:middle line:84%
may be the most
difficult in my life

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.990 align:middle line:84%
have been willing to
take on this heaviness

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.400 align:middle line:90%
so that I can learn.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.860 align:middle line:90%
What a gift.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Groups of souls, soul
families so to speak-- they

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:24.510 align:middle line:84%
call them monads-- often
incarnate in groups

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.380 align:middle line:90%
to help each other.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:90%
They sit down.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And they plan out the life
that they need this next time.

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they need
to learn compassion.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So their fellow souls
in their soul family

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.300 align:middle line:84%
say, you know what, I'll
volunteer to be your Mom.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I have to learn
something about mothering.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And another one
says, I'll volunteer

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.910 align:middle line:90%
to be your best friend.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And I'll betray you.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:56.180 align:middle line:84%
They volunteer to
do various roles

00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:84%
in this play of this next life
that you're going to live.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.695 align:middle line:84%
They're all going
to get something

00:46:02.695 --> 00:46:04.870 align:middle line:90%
from it, some learning.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle line:90%
And so are you.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Certain soul
group members take

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
on that role of going
through certain things.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
when you transition,

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.690 align:middle line:84%
your energy, regardless
of how it happened,

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.230 align:middle line:90%
you go back to your source.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And you start again.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
are left behind

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.370 align:middle line:84%
are the ones processing
that lesson, perhaps

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:30.790 align:middle line:90%
to a bit more extreme.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>We learn by not only
learning through our actions.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.370 align:middle line:90%
We learn by being.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:middle line:84%
We learn by becoming that
which we wish to learn.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds bizarre.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's so effective.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.545 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
you know something

00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:49.290 align:middle line:90%
is to experience it, to be it.

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>And all of those
various roles that we play

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.770 align:middle line:84%
teach us something about
the human experience,

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:57.510 align:middle line:90%
about the soul experience.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of have to
play all those roles

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.636 align:middle line:84%
to reach the point
of enlightenment.

00:47:03.636 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I think our soul is
reveling in the opportunity

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.320 align:middle line:84%
to try on different suits
of clothes, if you will,

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.480 align:middle line:84%
different bodies,
different experiences.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's all in its
journey back to wholeness,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:90%
back to being complete.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>We have to know what
it's like to be a murderer,

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to be murdered, to be hated, to
be loved, to be compassionate.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.170 align:middle line:84%
A complete and total
awareness that we're all one,

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:39.530 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
separation, that you

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:45.500 align:middle line:84%
can love the poor soul
that's in the gutter,

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the drunk, that you
can love the murderer.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:54.330 align:middle line:84%
You can love every one
just as if they were you.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is the
ultimate in enlightenment.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>So we make the soul
contract as a spirit.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, we come in through
the act of conception.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.200 align:middle line:90%
We dream our life in the womb.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And when we come out into the
physical plane, we manifest it.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>On average, 3,000 people
commit suicide every day,

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:29.730 align:middle line:84%
the global mortality rate of
one completed suicide every 30

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.400 align:middle line:90%
seconds.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the most perplexing and
difficult deaths to deal with

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.280 align:middle line:90%
is death by suicide.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult for
those left behind

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to put the pieces together, to
figure out why this happened.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Suicide's a bad idea because
you're leaving opportunity

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.740 align:middle line:90%
behind.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.112 align:middle line:90%
You don't pass go.

00:48:52.112 --> 00:48:53.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't collect $200.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.980 align:middle line:90%
You just start over.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a waste of
your time and effort.

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a very traumatic way to go.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.390 align:middle line:84%
When you go to
suicide, you're usually

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:08.760 align:middle line:84%
a very traumatized,
self-focused.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Because before you
get to that point,

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to be very
self-focused to get there.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.228 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not talking
about somebody

00:49:14.228 --> 00:49:16.590 align:middle line:84%
who's about to die with a
terrible, painful disease.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
end it a month early

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:21.490 align:middle line:90%
because it's very expensive.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:22.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's just torture for them.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.912 align:middle line:90%
Or they're drugged up.

00:49:23.912 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a
suicide where somebody just

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.340 align:middle line:84%
gets fed up with
life or whatever.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And they want to end it all.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Very bad idea.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.150 align:middle line:90%
You're so traumatized.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.905 align:middle line:84%
You're so self-focused
when you get to that point

00:49:35.905 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that it makes your
transition very difficult.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It damages your psyche,
your consciousness

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.951 align:middle line:84%
to some degree in that
it makes it easier

00:49:46.951 --> 00:49:48.575 align:middle line:84%
for you to do that
again the next time.

00:49:48.575 --> 00:49:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So it can get
into a cycle where

00:49:56.130 --> 00:50:00.680 align:middle line:84%
people get to a tough
spot, suicide's the answer

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:84%
because they've done
that two or three times

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.560 align:middle line:90%
already in various lifetimes.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a trend you
want to start to begin with.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, it wastes
the time you have here.

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You've already spent 20 or 30
years, or at least 15 or 16

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.155 align:middle line:84%
years, getting through
the stuff phase.

00:50:18.155 --> 00:50:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>It takes you probably 30 or
40 years to get to the point

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that you've worked
through all the stuff

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.820 align:middle line:84%
that you have to work through
to where you really start asking

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.901 align:middle line:84%
big picture questions, to
where the quality of your being

00:50:40.901 --> 00:50:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and your life start to
make a difference to you.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.770 align:middle line:84%
When you're 25
years old, you don't

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:46.855 align:middle line:84%
think about the
quality of your being.

00:50:46.855 --> 00:50:49.937 align:middle line:84%
You think about the weekend
and where you're going to go

00:50:49.937 --> 00:50:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and the fun you're going to
have and your relationships.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're so filled with
living this physical life

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that the bigger dimensions to it
generally aren't much in focus.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go through
maybe 30, sometimes 40, years

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:84%
before you really
start to care about,

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.970 align:middle line:90%
what's the significance of me?

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:13.920 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Why am I turning this crank?

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.360 align:middle line:90%
What's the bigger purpose?

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And those questions
start to bubble up.

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
the time to leave.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.170 align:middle line:84%
That's just the
time to get to work.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Each suicide
intimately affects

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.410 align:middle line:90%
at least six other people.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>We grow through drama.

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Call it good, bad,
or indifferent.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.720 align:middle line:84%
We create drama for training,
for learning purposes.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's even the purpose for wars.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:49.320 align:middle line:84%
People learn through
drama, through conflict.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.850 align:middle line:84%
That's just the state of
consciousness we're in.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>And the Earth is a
place, I have found,

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.790 align:middle line:90%
that we come to visit.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:55.766 align:middle line:90%
No one stays here.

00:51:55.766 --> 00:51:58.300 align:middle line:84%
No matter how
attached a person is,

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.120 align:middle line:84%
this is a school where
we come to learn lessons.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.639 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a decision to come
into the physical plane.

00:52:03.639 --> 00:52:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
decision to come here.

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.240 align:middle line:90%
This is a schoolhouse.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.770 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn something.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:12.330 align:middle line:84%
We're here to evolve our spirit
through certain experiences,

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.030 align:middle line:84%
through certain lessons
that we've learned.

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>There's something that's
built into this world that

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:24.020 align:middle line:84%
is kind of unique, I
think, in many ways.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world
of contrasts, meaning

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.120 align:middle line:84%
there's dark and light, male
and female, and big and little,

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.100 align:middle line:90%
up and down.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And those contrasts, in some
ways, can be sort of painful.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Because some of that feels good.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.870 align:middle line:90%
And some of it doesn't.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think all of
that works together

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:48.560 align:middle line:84%
in a way that sort of crafts our
soul in ways that we might not

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.630 align:middle line:84%
be able to do in different
types of environments.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.617 align:middle line:90%
>>You have to grow up.

00:52:53.617 --> 00:52:55.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to lower the entry
of your consciousness.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:56.491 align:middle line:90%
You have to evolve.

00:52:56.491 --> 00:53:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're here and until
you evolve to the next step,

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:90%
you're still here.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And until you evolve to the
next step, you're still here.

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So just dying doesn't change
a whole lot other than

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:14.720 align:middle line:90%
put you in a different reality.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Let you plan the next thing.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Then you go on.

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really the
big, oh, after I die,

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:26.426 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go meet Gabriel
and do this and do that.

00:53:26.426 --> 00:53:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have all of
these expectations.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:29.091 align:middle line:90%
And I'll know everything.

00:53:29.091 --> 00:53:32.040 align:middle line:84%
All the secrets will
be revealed to me.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It isn't like that.

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no free lunch.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:40.726 align:middle line:84%
You don't grow up just
because you want to,

00:53:40.726 --> 00:53:42.350 align:middle line:84%
just because you
think it would be nice

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.450 align:middle line:84%
or just because you've
switched reality frames.

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Some say, before
enlightenment,

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:48.070 align:middle line:90%
chop wood, carry water.

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:49.920 align:middle line:84%
After enlightenment,
chop wood, carry water.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, you do your job.

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.060 align:middle line:90%
You live your life.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.400 align:middle line:84%
You serve the purpose
that you're here to serve.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And you do it selflessly.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:01.780 align:middle line:90%
You do it lovingly.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.330 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy it.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.470 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to suffer.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:10.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a beautiful
mantra, Om Namah Shivaya.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is mine.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Everything is thine.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything is here for
me to use and enjoy

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:20.080 align:middle line:84%
but not to possess
nor be possessed by.

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So we are here,
Om Namah Shivaya,

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:28.590 align:middle line:84%
to live this beautiful place
we've all manifest into.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.370 align:middle line:90%
How lucky are we?

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And how lucky are we to
have people in our lives

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.020 align:middle line:90%
to love and to care with?

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>It really all comes
back to being about love.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Everything is based in love.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And we separate
ourselves from it.

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:47.895 align:middle line:84%
Our ego's job is to kind
of keep us separate.

00:54:47.895 --> 00:54:50.200 align:middle line:84%
As I'm trying to come
to the understanding

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that I'm really not
separate, the ego's

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.790 align:middle line:84%
apt to freak out, give
me all kinds of reasons

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:57.819 align:middle line:90%
to believe that I'm separate.

00:54:57.819 --> 00:54:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at this.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:54:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Of course you're separate.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:00.620 align:middle line:90%
You're separate.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:01.203 align:middle line:90%
You're unique.

00:55:01.203 --> 00:55:03.410 align:middle line:90%
You're distinct, whatever.

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And my soul is striving through
all of this to reach oneness.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:13.360 align:middle line:84%
My ego is having the
opportunity to morph,

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:90%
to take on a different job.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I've asked my ego
if it wouldn't like

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to help me to remember
that I'm part of the whole

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.240 align:middle line:84%
rather than needing
to be separate.

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>What is it that you believe?

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.000 align:middle line:84%
What were you taught
as a young child

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.890 align:middle line:90%
about what happens when you die?

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Do you still carry
those same beliefs?

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Or have they changed?

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Many people rely on
religion or beliefs

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to help understand where
the soul goes when it dies.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Many of us hold
onto those beliefs.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:84%
However, can these
beliefs sometimes

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:54.190 align:middle line:84%
limit us from exploring
other possibilities

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:57.230 align:middle line:90%
as to what happens when we die?

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Seminary was a
process of dismantling

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.580 align:middle line:90%
a lot of my beliefs.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Before I went to seminary, I had
my beliefs pretty well in mind.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I usually say that my
story begins in many ways

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:12.780 align:middle line:84%
when I fell off of the roof
of an underground house.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.030 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the 1970s.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And my brother and I had
a construction company.

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
first energy crisis.

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And so people were exploring
all kinds of different ways

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to save energy in building
and in cars and whatnot.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So my brother and I thought
that underground houses

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.720 align:middle line:90%
were the wave of the future.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And one day we were
building a home.

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:37.380 align:middle line:90%
They're made out of concrete.

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And I was up on top of the roof.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And we had just poured
the concrete roof.

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was pulling
on a form board.

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, it gave way.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
falling off of the roof.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even have any
time to adjust to the fall.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And I slammed into
a pile of gravel.

00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
it at the time.

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up
fracturing my hip.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.620 align:middle line:90%
They put me in physical therapy.

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that, when
I was in physical therapy,

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that I was in
extraordinary pain.

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.477 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctor
came by one day.

00:57:06.477 --> 00:57:08.643 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
said, you're really hurting,

00:57:08.643 --> 00:57:09.160 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, let's take
some more x-rays of that hip.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when they did,
taking at an oblique angle,

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:19.790 align:middle line:84%
they did find that there
was a fracture there.

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:21.260 align:middle line:84%
The doctor comes
in and says, I'm

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be off
work for six weeks

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.840 align:middle line:90%
and that I would be in traction.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into this
spiral of pain and anxiety

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:32.850 align:middle line:84%
at that time, pain because the
hip was pretty excruciating.

00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of went
spiraling downward.

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I popped through

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.760 align:middle line:84%
into an entirely
different reality.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And in this reality, all of
the pain that I had in my hip

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:49.155 align:middle line:90%
completely disappeared.

00:57:49.155 --> 00:57:51.470 align:middle line:90%
The anxiety evaporated.

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I found myself surrounded
by complete peace.

00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:58.520 align:middle line:84%
After awhile, I
was also standing

00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.970 align:middle line:90%
in front of this being of light.

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And we were conversing
about my life without words.

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of that
experience so stunned.

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I had no idea
that another reality like

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that even existed,
much less the idea

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that you might be
able to experience it.

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had been
wrestling with an issue of

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.960 align:middle line:84%
whether or not I
should go to seminary.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.589 align:middle line:84%
Because I really felt
a call to the ministry.

00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, my
immediate reaction

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:26.630 align:middle line:84%
was, well, this is
the voice of God.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And I need to go into seminary.

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So I took my wife and, at
that time, two children.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And we went to Princeton
Theological Seminary.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I went through the
three years of training

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to get my Master's Degree
there and then became

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.750 align:middle line:90%
a Presbyterian pastor.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But as the years
went on, I began

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:47.310 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the real
purpose of that experience

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:49.530 align:middle line:84%
was to give me a
taste of something

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and to create a hunger for
something that I knew that

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.130 align:middle line:84%
deep down in my bones
that I had to understand

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and to explore more fully.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.520 align:middle line:90%
That hunger was so intense.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It was even more intensified
as I went into the ministry

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:84%
because there weren't a lot
of people who were speaking

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.910 align:middle line:84%
about that kind of thing,
at least in my church.

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I found myself in this
state of tension, if you will,

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.750 align:middle line:84%
between where I
really wanted to go

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and what I really
wanted to explore

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and the appearances
that I had to keep up

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:25.720 align:middle line:90%
in my role as a pastor.

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I went into what was then
called the world's largest

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:30.400 align:middle line:90%
bookstore in Toronto, Canada.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into
this place, there

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:34.550 align:middle line:84%
are books just as far
as the eye can see.

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
millions of books.

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't in there
but two minutes

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:41.860 align:middle line:84%
when, all of a sudden, one
book jumped off the shelf.

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was Bob Monroe's
second book, "Far Journeys."

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:47.390 align:middle line:84%
When I started
reading that thing,

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I simply couldn't
put the thing down.

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:51.630 align:middle line:90%
It was so stunning to me.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Here, for the first
time, was somebody

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.160 align:middle line:84%
who was talking in
a contemporary sense

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.000 align:middle line:84%
about the experience I had
when I fell off the roof.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.020 align:middle line:84%
12 years after I read that
book, I had my first opportunity

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to come to the Monroe Institute
and go through the program

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.070 align:middle line:90%
here, in the Gateway Voyage.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And to my utter
amazement, that world

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that I experienced when
I fell off the roof

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.970 align:middle line:84%
opened up in space
all over again,

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.340 align:middle line:90%
which was both gift and curse.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one hand, it
was a rediscovery of something

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that was so dear and so
wonderful and powerful for me.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, it
only increased the tension

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:35.070 align:middle line:90%
with my role as a pastor.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I left the church and the
pastorate in the year 2000.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But two months after I walked
out of the door of the church,

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I got a call from
the Institute here

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
asking me if I would like to
become a residential trainer.

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But the real force
that has had an impact

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
has been this kind
of work, this kind

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
of exploration of
altered perceptions,

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:01.760 align:middle line:90%
the metaphysical world.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, for me, the
most compelling component

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.600 align:middle line:84%
of all that is the
experiential domain.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Religion is a viable way to
grow but without the dogma,

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:18.091 align:middle line:84%
without the creeds, without
the arrogance, without the,

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:18.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm right.

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
You're wrong, that
sort of thing.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people who are

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
truly spiritual and
religious, they see that.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
They see value in
the words of Buddha.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They see value in the
words of the Dalai Lama.

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:35.312 align:middle line:84%
They can see that
these things are all

01:01:35.312 --> 01:01:36.520 align:middle line:90%
headed in the same direction.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
love, peace, giving.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.840 align:middle line:90%
They're not into the, I'm right.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.070 align:middle line:90%
You're wrong.

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:45.589 align:middle line:84%
If they are, then they're
just not very evolved.

01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:46.880 align:middle line:90%
And they're not very spiritual.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
No matter how religious
they claim to be,

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.240 align:middle line:90%
they're doing something else.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
They're feeding their
ego, feeling superior

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.249 align:middle line:90%
because they're right.

01:01:55.249 --> 01:01:56.415 align:middle line:90%
And everybody else is wrong.

01:01:56.415 --> 01:01:59.777 align:middle line:84%
Well, feeling superior's
not on your way to success.

01:01:59.777 --> 01:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a difference between
being religious and being

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.180 align:middle line:90%
spiritual.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Being religious, you
have a certain set

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:08.640 align:middle line:84%
of ideologies and belief
systems that you absolutely

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.970 align:middle line:90%
don't go beyond.

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, being
religious means, in a sense,

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.200 align:middle line:84%
that you judge other people for
not believing the same thing.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.355 align:middle line:84%
I disagree with that
aspect of religion.

01:02:22.355 --> 01:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Obviously, we can
go around the world

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.688 align:middle line:84%
today and see all
sorts of people wanting

01:02:25.688 --> 01:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
to kill each other
over religion.

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Where's the
spirituality in that?

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, there isn't any.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So religion and spirituality
are two different things.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.890 align:middle line:90%
They can travel together.

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.890 align:middle line:90%
They can travel separately.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Religion can be anti-spiritual.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It can take you in the
opposite direction.

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.785 align:middle line:84%
And it does that, if your
religion is basically

01:02:47.785 --> 01:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
your dogma, your belief system.

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:53.102 align:middle line:90%
That sort of stuff has no value.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:54.860 align:middle line:90%
It has negative value.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>If you examine the profound
spiritual experiences

01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
of all cultures, you will
find that the common element

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
in all religious
text is that someone

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
went beyond their
physical limits.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Someone had the courage
and the foresight

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to reach out and
spread their wings

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and explore beyond the narrow
limits of their physical body.

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what made the difference
between a great spiritual

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
leader and those that are just
want to bes, that are just

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
parrots repeating someone
else's written word.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>What their true
teaching is, not

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
what maybe we pulled
out of it in order

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.195 align:middle line:84%
to have power or
control or out of fear.

01:03:38.195 --> 01:03:41.480 align:middle line:90%


01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that any
of these great beings,

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.500 align:middle line:84%
these great sages, were saying
anything other than, go within.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Be the love that you are.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Realize it within every being.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And treat everyone that way.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And it will be brought to you.

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Religion is a way
that you can grow.

01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not like being
religious is a false path.

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
That's a path that's called
the path of surrender

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
where you give yourself
up to the larger thing.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.330 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
religious path.

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Eastern religions
are on a path of surrender.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%
All aren't.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Some are.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
That, though, has
nothing to do with dogma.

01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Dogma is a different
kind of thing.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Dogma is a bunch
of belief systems.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It's ritual and other things.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's very
little value in dogma.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So the religious path,
the path of surrender,

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
is a valid way of growing
but only in as much as you're

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.820 align:middle line:90%
thinking in the big picture.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.531 align:middle line:90%
It's about love.

01:04:35.531 --> 01:04:36.280 align:middle line:90%
It's about others.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.135 align:middle line:90%
It's about service.

01:04:37.135 --> 01:04:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It's about growing up.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.320 align:middle line:90%
It's about who you are inside.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.284 align:middle line:84%
It's not about raise
your right hand

01:04:45.284 --> 01:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and swear that you
believe these things.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.264 align:middle line:84%
You don't get any credit
for believing anything.

01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:50.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not about belief.

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.444 align:middle line:90%
It's about who you are.

01:04:51.444 --> 01:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>For me, there's
a big difference

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
between belief and experience.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Belief is something that you
construct maybe independent

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
of experience or maybe you take
the experiences of your life

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and you try to put them together
in some kind of logical way.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes a belief
that you hold pretty dearly.

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes
very difficult

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.310 align:middle line:90%
to give those beliefs up.

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because we're very,
very attached to them.

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to actually move

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
into these other ranges of
perception, when you begin

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to move into other
ranges of experience,

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
it's a different category
of knowing than belief.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Belief is largely
about speculation.

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe it's like this.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you move
into experience,

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
then that becomes a part
of your sense of knowing.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>We all come in with certain
frameworks of beliefs.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those
can act as boxes,

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:55.970 align:middle line:90%
which are limitations for us.

01:05:55.970 --> 01:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And when we can have these
personal experiences, then

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
somehow there's a
new crack in the box.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Or the lid's lifted
a little bit.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to expand and
open up to new possibilities.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Most of us have bought into
a belief system at a young age.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.440 align:middle line:90%
We have been spoon-fed.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter what it is.

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But we've all been spoon-fed
some kind of religious belief

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:20.980 align:middle line:90%
system.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And most people accept
what they're given.

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Belief is a trap.

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you
believe is a trap.

If you are interested
in an area,

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.540 align:middle line:84%
don't believe
something about it.

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Go find out about it.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Go do it and experience it.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:39.010 align:middle line:90%
