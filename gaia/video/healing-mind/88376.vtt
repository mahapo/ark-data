00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.203 align:middle line:84%
>>More and more, history is
happening faster and faster.

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:10%
It is said that we in the West
live 50 to 100 times the amount

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:10%
of sheer experience of
our ancestors of just 100

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:10%
years ago.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
New discoveries and
technologies have

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
brought tremendous benefits and
opportunities the world over.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.121 align:middle line:84%
But as with anything,
it has come at a price.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:84%
With the acceleration in the
speed and volume of experience

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
we live on a daily
basis, we have

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
seen a similar acceleration
in the amount of depression,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.865 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, ADD, and
other mood disorders.

00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Many have turned to
medication looking for relief.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
The use of antidepressants
alone has increased nearly 400%

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:90%
since 1990.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Is there another way to
address this epidemic?

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:84%
A 5,000-year-old scientific
tradition known as Ayurveda

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:90%
leads us to believe there is.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>In Ayurveda, we understand
that the real root

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
of mental distress
is that we've lost

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of the
true nature of ourselves

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and of the world.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Today in the
world, if you see,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:84%
so many young adults are taking
antidepressant medicines,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%
especially in the United States.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But this problem is increasing
now all over the world.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:90%
What is the reason?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>In Ayurvedic
philosophy, we would

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
say the loss of understanding
is due to a covering over

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of the deepest, most
important part of the mind.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>And the things we are doing
from morning to night, either

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
it is on computers or
cellphones, or watching TV.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:10%
>>Too much temptation, too
much stimulation-- and that's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:10%
why there are all these problems
of hyperactive disorder,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:10%
attention deficit
hyperactive disorder.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Too many patients
that do not need drugs,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that are on
pharmaceuticals today

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
due to the heavy pressure
and marketing and advertising

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:90%
of the companies themselves.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>Ayurveda has a completely
different concept

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of mental disease.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.335 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it has a completely
different concept of the mind.

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:10%
>>The system of Ayurveda had its
birth approximately 5,000 years

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:10%
ago during the Vedic
period in India,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:10%
with the first
written recordings

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:10%
appearing 3,000 years ago.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Its practical application
to holistic health

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is as relevant today as
it was in ancient times.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The goal of life is very simply
becoming healthy and happy.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:10%
And we can all achieve
this by incorporating

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda's simple principle
of mindfully feeding our body,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:10%
feeding our mind,
and feeding our soul.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>When we talk about
food, it's not only

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:90%
what we eat from our mouth.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
What we watch, what we smell,
what we hear, what we think,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:90%
what we are talking.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>And learning really how
to think of the senses

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
as organs that receive food
in the form of impressions,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure that
that food is nourishing.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>Everything is
food, and all this

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:90%
is connected with our mind.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.844 align:middle line:10%
>>Join us as we uncover the
ancient science of Ayurveda

00:04:25.844 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:10%
and the unique
opportunity we now

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:10%
have to incorporate the best
of both Eastern and Western

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:10%
psychiatric practices
in promoting healing

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:10%
on a deeper, more
holistic level.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
The history of Ayurveda
can trace its roots

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
back 5,000 years,
when it is said

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.817 align:middle line:84%
to have been
acquired by the sages

00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:90%
through divine revelation.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It was passed down through
the generations in oral form,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
until it was recorded in
the ancient holy texts known

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:29.604 align:middle line:84%
as the Vedas around 1500 BC, in
the land of the seven rivers,

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
in the foothills
of the Himalayas.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>The origins of
Ayurveda occurred

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
because these wandering
tribes of people

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
began to organize
themselves into these very

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
modern contrivances that were
assigned the word "village."

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:84%
The people that aggregated
in these villages

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
were doing so for protection
against the elements,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
for protection
against enemy tribes,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and also so that they
can adapt a more agrarian

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of lifestyle, and
grow food and store food

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.545 align:middle line:84%
and always have supplies
of food on hand.

00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
As a consequence of
all of these people

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
coming together in these
concentrations that

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:84%
hadn't existed before,
there were different kinds

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:84%
of ailments and afflictions
that had never been seen before.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Learned sages and
saints known as rishis,

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
who devoted their
life to understanding

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the realities of
the world, realized

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that sickness was
a major impediment

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:90%
to the search for liberation.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And so many of them became
vijas to help their people.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Vija, the Sanskrit
word for physician,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is derived from the
root word for wisdom.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>And so a small group of
wise elderly men and women

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
were sent up into the
foothills of the Himalayas,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
where they could be surrounded
by nature and in a very

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:84%
quiet, contemplative
frame of mind.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Our rishis who
used to meditate,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
they used to have their
libraries and study rooms.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And they used to have even
their liberties, I would say.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:10%
And they were continuously
working or thinking,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:10%
trying to find out ways
how the human beings can

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:10%
become more healthy
and more happy.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>And what emerged from these
convocations of people--

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:01.680 align:middle line:84%
of wise people-- was
Ayurvedic medicine.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Hindu mythology tells us
that Lord Brahma, the creator

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
of the world, reawakened
the knowledge of Ayurveda

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.204 align:middle line:90%
to mankind.

00:08:09.204 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>This did not involve
scientific method

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
or empirical
thinking, but rather

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:84%
this kind of shamanistic,
mystical, direct knowledge

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that came to these
people regarding

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:84%
the nature of disease,
the nature of life,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
medical treatment.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>This stream of Ayurvedic
medical knowledge

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
was considered eternal, because
it was known by the rishis

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
to have been there since
the beginning of time.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>It's an ancient,
spiritual, Vedic scripture.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:90%
And they speak about Ayurveda.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It is not a creation of
human mind or human brain.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%
It was there.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:90%
They just received the memory.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>What is certain is
that the great rishis'

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:90%
motive was compassion.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Their purpose, to
alleviate human suffering.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:10%
And their recorded precepts
were for their disciples,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:10%
whom they trained for
the service of humanity,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:10%
a tradition which
continues to be performed

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:10%
5,000 years after its birth.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:84%
The history of Western
medicine traces its roots back

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
to a different time and place,
and followed a much different

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It was the year 460 BC,
in the Age of Pericles,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.408 align:middle line:84%
on the island of Cos that
Hippocrates was born.

00:10:05.408 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>All Western
medical specialties,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
including psychiatry,
really originate

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:90%
with the ancient Greeks.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates is called the
father of Western medicine.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Even today, the graduates of
all Western medical schools

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
take the Hippocratic Oath
when they graduate and become

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%
full-fledged physicians.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>The people of that time
viewed mental illness

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:84%
as a form of
punishment by the gods,

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
or a manifestation of the
devil possessing the suffering

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.705 align:middle line:84%
>>There were no real
treatments for patients.

00:10:45.705 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:90%
There were restraints.

There were poisons given.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But the violent
psychiatric patients

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
were usually put in
chains or killed.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Hippocrates, on
the other hand,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
believed that diseases
were caused naturally,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
not because of
superstition or the gods.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
He used the notion of
an imbalance of humors.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
These four bodily
fluids were believed

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.632 align:middle line:84%
to be influenced by the
environment, the weather,

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:90%
and food.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>The goal of ancient
Greek medicine

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
was actually to restore
balance to these humors,

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and thereby restore
physical and mental health.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>His therapeutic
approach was based

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:90%
on the healing power of nature.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
According to this
doctrine, the body

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
contains within itself the
power to balance the four humors

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and heal itself.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Much of the Greek
medical tradition

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
had been assimilated
into the Roman Empire.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:84%
As Rome slowly
collapsed and Europe

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.365 align:middle line:84%
slipped into the Dark Ages,
much of that knowledge was lost.

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>At this point,
the Catholic church

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
really had control over
all scholarly activities

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
in the West.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
If certain individuals chose
to challenge church doctrine

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
on any matters of
natural science,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
they faced condemnation and
possibly even death for heresy.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>It wasn't until a
philosopher and mathematician--

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:84%
a Renaissance man-- found a
novel way of challenging church

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
doctrine that the next
influential moment

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.227 align:middle line:90%
in Western medicine emerged.

00:12:35.227 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:10%
>>Rene Descartes was
a major inspiration

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:10%
for the scientific
revolution that took place

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:10%
in Europe in the 17th century.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Scientists and
physicians of his day

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.165 align:middle line:84%
were prevented from doing
dissections on cadavers.

00:12:58.165 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The church viewed this as a
desecration of God's handiwork.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Rene Descartes said
that all of reality

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:84%
was divided essentially into two
domains, the spiritual domain

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:90%
and the material domain.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>He said that the church
should confine itself

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to matters of the
human soul, and leave

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
the workings of the human body
to the scientists of the day.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
The church authorities decided
to accept this argument.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>That finally opened the
doors for scholars of all sorts

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to be able to start
doing experimentation

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
within the domain of
the natural world.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Medicine became
taught in a context

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:84%
where mind or soul and
the body became split off.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:10%
This dualist view of
the would influence

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:10%
all of Western
thought, including

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:10%
its approach to healing
both mind and body.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
From Descartes' time
to the 19th century,

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:84%
illness became seen primarily
as a physical phenomenon,

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.416 align:middle line:90%
no longer involving the soul.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
The mentally ill were typically
viewed more as wild animals,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and harsh treatments
and restraints,

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
similar to Medieval times,
were seen as therapeutic.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:10%
>>In England, people used
to go by a famous asylum

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:10%
called Bedlam that had
been there for centuries,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:10%
looking in through the gates at
the wild, psychotic, peculiar

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:10%
mental patients.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>German psychiatrist
Emil Kraepelin,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
considered the founder of
modern scientific psychiatry,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
spoke out against this
inhumane treatment.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
He believed the chief origin
of psychiatric disease

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:90%
to be biological.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And by identifying
specific disorders,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the progression
of mental illness

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.415 align:middle line:90%
can be predicted and treated.

00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And his theories
dominated psychiatry

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:90%
at the turn of the 20th century.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Perhaps in response
to this overemphasis

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
on biological factors,
the early 20th century

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.240 align:middle line:84%
saw three great pioneers
within psychiatry.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They recognized that, many
times, diseases of the body

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
actually have their origin
in conflicts and fears based

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
in the mind, that you couldn't
actually treat mind and body as

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
though they were separate
from one another.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>As a result, early
psychiatry split

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:84%
into two competing traditions,
one emphasizing thoughts,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and dreams as
the keys to the healing

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
of mental disorders,
and another that

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
looked for clues
to these disorders

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:90%
in the tissues of the brain.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of 50
years, many offshoots

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
of Freud's initial
concepts formed,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.540 align:middle line:84%
so many that it became
difficult for the movement

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to philosophically
hold together.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:10%
Disagreement about
which treatments

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:10%
matched which symptoms,
and controversy

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:10%
of the overall effectiveness of
treatment stalled the movement.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And this laid the groundwork
for the course psychiatry

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:90%
would take to present day.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>In the second half
of the 20th century,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
we witnessed another
major revolution

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:90%
within the field of psychiatry.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
ever, medications

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
were discovered
that could treat,

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
or at least to some
extent reverse,

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
some of the symptoms of
major psychiatric illness.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The discovery of these
medication treatments

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
once again swung
the pendulum back

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.050 align:middle line:90%
towards a biological emphasis.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%

The history of
Western medicine has

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:10%
seen an ongoing struggle
for the influence--

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:10%
and often control--
between examining the mind,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:10%
examining the body, and
examining the soul in order

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:10%
to diagnose and heal.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:10%
The question is, are
we now on the verge

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:10%

really is the
clinical interview.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I'll often begin by asking
the patient how their mood has

been, how their sleeping
patterns have been,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%

great deal of attention

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to their nonverbal language,
because that actually

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
gives me a lot of
information about how

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:90%
they interact socially.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Then, of critical importance
to me is the family history.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you look at the
history of alcoholism and drug

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
abuse, which is
critical in taking

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:84%
a history on any
psychiatric patient.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
These two problems
are so prevalent.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>I'll also review
their medical records

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to see what other types
of health problems

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:84%
they may have encountered,
since this may also

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
impact their emotional wellness.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>I want to see an EKG.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to see a
biochemical profile

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:90%
and any neurologic workup.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The reason that we
are so concerned

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
about the medical
condition-- there

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:84%
are many medical illnesses
that are mimicked

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:84%
by psychiatric illness,
and vice versa.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, thyroid
disease oftentimes

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is manifested as a
depressed patient.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Cardiac disease
may manifest itself

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
with palpitations and
symptoms very similar

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:90%
to an anxiety attack.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Many medical conditions are
accompanied by depression.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:10%
>>When we put all of
these parts together,

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:10%
we get the biopsychosocial
picture of that patient.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:10%
>>Finally, the
psychiatrist will match up

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:10%
this picture with one
of the symptom clusters

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:10%
that's described in the
"Diagnostics and Statistics

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:10%
Manual," which
lists all currently

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:10%
recognized mental
health disorders.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.645 align:middle line:10%
While it's very
rare for a person

00:20:48.645 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:10%
to fit every single
diagnostic criteria,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:10%
the DSM-IV is the
most widely used tool

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.175 align:middle line:10%
in diagnosing mental
health disorders.

00:20:57.175 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>We're trying to
accurately pinpoint

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the biological
factors that are contributing

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:90%
to their current picture.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:84%
What are some of their
psychological issues that

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.496 align:middle line:84%
are also impacting
their emotional health?

00:21:13.496 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, what are
some of the social issues

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.977 align:middle line:84%
and relationship
issues that are making

00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:20.435 align:middle line:84%
a contribution to the way that
they're feeling emotionally?

00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:46.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most
important realizations

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
that came from wise
elderly men and women

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
in the foothills
of the Himalayas

00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
was that the entire world is
composed of five elements.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And those five
elements were seen

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:84%
to be space, air,
fire, water, and earth.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, it was seen
that these five elements

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
not only make up the
universe at large,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
but also duplicate themselves
within each human being.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:84%
By understanding the elements
and how they combine uniquely

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
in each individual,
we could understand

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.483 align:middle line:84%
the energetic processes at
play in the disease process.

00:22:36.483 --> 00:22:39.201 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.201 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:10%
>>These five elements were
seen to form in human beings

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:10%
into three biological
forces, known as the doshas,

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:10%
and regulate the structure and
function of both body and mind.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.406 align:middle line:84%
The three doshas are known
as vata, pitta, and kapha.

00:22:56.406 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Vata primarily is responsible
for mobility, for movement.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Anything that moves in our
body is powered by vata.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>From the blinking of the
eyes to the coursing of blood

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:84%
through the arteries and veins,
to the beating of the heart,

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:84%
to the movement of thoughts
through the mind-- everywhere

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
there is the slightest
or grossest movement,

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that movement is controlled
by the vata dosha.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:31.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Pitta is that energy which
is responsible for metabolism.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.205 align:middle line:84%
Anything that we eat is
going to be digested.

00:23:38.205 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It has to be digested.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Then, it has to be metabolized.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>It's the pitta
dosha that actually

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
digests food and
impressions from the world

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and transforms them into
something nourishing.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.110 align:middle line:84%
It's pitta dosha that
gives us our capacity

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
for perception and
for understanding.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>The third energy
in our body is kapha.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Kapha is primarily
water and earth element.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like mud and mucus,
like a glue, or the gum.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Kapha dosha is what
gives a human being

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:90%
the cohesive nature.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It's what stops our arms
from falling off our torsos.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.075 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives us the ability
to have long-term memory.

00:24:23.075 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:84%
To become attached to
those that we love,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and to empathize with others.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Improper functioning
of both body and mind

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
is caused by an
imbalance of the doshas.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>In Ayurveda, there are really
three aspects to the treatment.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:84%
The first is in the
balancing of the doshas.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
sam dosha chikitsa.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>The practitioner
begins by gathering

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
information on the
patient's symptoms,

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
their duration,
level of discomfort,

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and progression, as
well as their current

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.345 align:middle line:90%
mental and physical state.

00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:84%
The practitioner then observes
movement and speech as well as

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.563 align:middle line:90%
body and facial characteristics.

00:25:12.563 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Finally, through touch,
the patient's condition

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.630 align:middle line:90%
comes into full view.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
There is special focus
on the patient's pulse,

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
as it can help to
determine the functioning

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and health of the entire
mind-body constitution,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:84%
including the status
of the doshas,

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
the health of the
various organs,

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and advance warning signs
of potential problems.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
At the same time that the
practitioner is diagnosing

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
the balance of the doshas,
which affect both body and mind,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
he is also paying
close attention

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to three subtle energies
specifically tuned

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
in to the mind known in
Ayurveda as the gunas.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Sattva is that state of
mind when mind is healthy,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
which means the mind is
quiet, relaxed, and happy.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And intelligence of
the person is working.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:84%
That means the mind
is full of knowledge.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Mind can discriminate
what is good for me,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:90%
what is not good for me.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Sattva means that a person
has a clear and lucid picture

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:90%
of the world outside.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
You're able to see and
experience the joy of life.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You're able to understand
that although there

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:38.420 align:middle line:84%
are negative occurrences
in the world,

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
you're able to
maintain at all times

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
the distinction between
the true self, which

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
has the nature of
sat-chit-ananda.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:10%
You're able to
remember at all times

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:10%
that you are not the events
that are occurring around you.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
However, in both the rajasic
and tamasic forms of mind,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
there are distortions
in that understanding.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Qualities that tamas
will infuse in the mind

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
will be dullness,
confusion, sleepiness.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
The mind is very shut down.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:90%
It's an unclear mind, dull mind.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Often when people are confused,
they do confused actions.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Rajas means if you are very
easily irritated and agitated,

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:84%
an agitated mind
means rajasic mind.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
You're always restless.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
The mind cannot relax.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.715 align:middle line:84%
You want to sleep,
and suddenly the mind

00:27:39.715 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
says, let me go on the Facebook
and check my friend's status

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:90%
and post something.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:90%
This is called agitated mind.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a rajasic mind, a
very, very common problem

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.290 align:middle line:90%
in this modern age, I would say.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.030 align:middle line:84%
A majority of the people have
too much rajas in their mind.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:84%
All the mental diseases that
we have in this modern time--

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
depression, manic
depression, bipolar disease--

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
any of the mental conditions,
according to Ayurveda,

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
are caused by excess of
rajas and tamas in the mind.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:17.172 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>I started taking
medication and--

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>It's helped a
little bit, but--

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I have no motivation
to do anything.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>My depression has gotten
in the way of my schoolwork.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:90%
I feel like a failure.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>I find that I need
medication to get stuff done.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>It just bothers me
that I'm not normal.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.744 align:middle line:84%
>>Some of my friends
need help, but I

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to give it.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, when I go to
the doctor, she'll

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.643 align:middle line:84%
pretty much prescribe
me anything I ask for.

00:28:36.643 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was a kid, I had
ADD, ADHD, extreme anxiety,

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:39.842 align:middle line:90%
social anxiety.

00:28:39.842 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Dopamine was messed up.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know what
to do when someone

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
admits to me that
they're depressed.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
be there for them,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.465 align:middle line:90%
how to get them to find help.

00:28:46.465 --> 00:28:48.506 align:middle line:84%
>>I finally found a
medication that works for me,

00:28:48.506 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
but I had to stop taking
it because of side effects.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Doctor gives me, this
will probably work.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.526 align:middle line:90%
Is this working?

00:28:52.526 --> 00:28:53.479 align:middle line:90%
Is this really not?

00:28:53.479 --> 00:28:54.395 align:middle line:90%
Different white pills.

00:28:54.395 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Ridiculous.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>The brain is really
the most complex organ

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
in the human body, so it
takes a lot of finesse

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to study without
causing damage to it.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
That being said, we
do have some idea

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:84%
about what's going
on in the brain

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
with particular
psychiatric disorders.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Research conducted by the
National Institute of Mental

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.894 align:middle line:84%
Health concludes that mental
disorders are actually

00:29:23.894 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:90%
brain disorders.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:84%
The brain is made up of
approximately 100 billion nerve

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:84%
cells known as neurons, which
communicate with each other

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.581 align:middle line:84%
through over one quadrillion
specialized connections known

00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:90%
as synapses.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:84%
These synapses facilitate
an electrochemical process

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
between the neurons,
utilizing neurotransmitters.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:10%
When this electrochemical
process is out of balance,

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.795 align:middle line:10%
mental illnesses, such as
depression, ADHD, anxiety,

00:29:54.795 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:10%
and other mood
disorders can occur.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:10%
Through the use of
psychiatric medication,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:10%
doctors aim to restore
balance to this process

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.800 align:middle line:10%
and bring relief to the patient.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>In Western medicine, it's
actually quite challenging

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:84%
to match a particular
individual's brain chemistry

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.405 align:middle line:90%
with a specific medication.

00:30:15.405 --> 00:30:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>When I see a new patient that
has been to 10 psychiatrists

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
before they come in, on
five, six, seven drugs,

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:84%
the wrong drugs in
the wrong dosages.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And they have been given
this trial and error

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.212 align:middle line:84%
by another doctor
or psychiatrist,

00:30:33.212 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and nothing has worked,
and nothing has worked,

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and nothing has worked.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:10%
>>Even the very best
of psychiatrists

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.180 align:middle line:10%
don't have any better than a 75%
rate of choosing the right drug

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:49.490 align:middle line:10%
in the right dosage at the
right time the first time.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:10%
>>Who do you think is
giving most of these drugs?

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the general practitioner.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not the psychiatrist.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And if it's the
psychiatrist, it's

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:90%
not the psychopharmacologist.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>They certainly do
receive some training

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:84%
as part of their medical
education in the prescribing

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:90%
of these particular drugs.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But their experience
is much, much less

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:90%
than psychiatrists have.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>The main reason
patients stop taking

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:84%
medication is due
to side effects.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:10%
Much of the art of
being a psychiatrist

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:10%
is helping the patient navigate
through the side effects

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.320 align:middle line:10%
long enough for the
medication to take effect,

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:10%
a skill many primary care
physicians simply don't have.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Western psychiatry
is looking once again

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.160 align:middle line:84%
toward scientific innovation
to address this problem.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>The matching of
particular medications

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.480 align:middle line:84%
with particular
patients is really

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the holy grail of all
medical specialties.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's now called
"personalized medicine."

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that we
can get to a point

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:84%
where we can genetically map
what's going on with them when

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
they're suffering from the
effects of some particular kind

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:90%
of disorder of illness.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:10.930 align:middle line:84%
We're not at that stage yet, but
that's certainly the direction

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.800 align:middle line:84%
that Western medicine
is heading in.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a loaded question.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Everyone says, which is
better, medication or therapy?

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I have to say in my
practice that the two are

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:90%
equally essential.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.290 align:middle line:10%
I do not believe
the drug is going

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.590 align:middle line:10%
to work as effectively as
a psychiatrist that reaches

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.070 align:middle line:10%
a patient, has a compassion
for the suffering

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:10%
that the patient's
going through.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:10%
The way the patient
feels about the doctor

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.794 align:middle line:10%
is incredibly important for
us, along with the medication.

00:32:45.794 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>And yet, due to the higher
cost of a psychiatrist's time,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:84%
outpatient clinics will often
split the patient's treatment

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:84%
by hiring non-physician
mental health

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
providers, such as social
workers, psychologists,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and family therapists to
conduct psychotherapy.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>A second issue that sort
of discourages psychiatrists

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
from being able to
practice psychotherapy

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.430 align:middle line:84%
within their
clinical practices is

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that insurance reimbursement
for physician-delivered

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.115 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy tends
to be very, very poor.

00:33:19.115 --> 00:33:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>And so the patient
often finds herself

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.520 align:middle line:84%
in a situation which
is driven in large part

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.740 align:middle line:84%
by cost, rather than potential
therapeutic effectiveness.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:84%
However, even in the
less than ideal business

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of Western medicine, psychiatry,
when practiced at its highest

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:45.660 align:middle line:84%
level, has shown the ability
to change lives, save lives,

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and measurably enhance
the quality of life.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Mental disease
is created because

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:90%
of one thing and one thing only.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:84%
And that one thing is something
known as avidya, or ignorance.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:12.215 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.215 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:10%
According to Ayurveda,
what we are ignorant of

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:10%
is our true nature.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:10%
We assign our identity to things
that are not truly ourselves.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:84%
We think of things as permanent
which are impermanent.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:35.750 align:middle line:84%
We think of things as important
which are, in reality, trivial.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.159 align:middle line:84%
We're not really sure
what we're made of

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.570 align:middle line:90%
and what our true nature is.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:43.440 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:10%
>>According to
Ayurveda, the mind

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.330 align:middle line:10%
has a specific organ which is
responsible for discriminating

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.790 align:middle line:10%
what is true and
what is not true,

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:55.070 align:middle line:10%
which is known as the buddhi.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.470 align:middle line:10%
>>What happens in
mental disease is

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:10%
that this discriminating
function of the mind

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:10%
becomes covered with
residues of past experiences,

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.370 align:middle line:10%
past unresolved emotions.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And these residues cover the
buddhi like waves in a mirror.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>We have so many
experiences, so many traumas,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
so many different
kinds of difficulties

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.480 align:middle line:90%
that we have faced.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And if those things-- we stay
connected with those things,

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
they are thrown into
my external mind, which

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is my brain and
the nervous system.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>This discriminating function
no longer operates normally.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And the perception, not only
of our world but of oneself,

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.200 align:middle line:90%
becomes distorted.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the source of
anxiety, depression,

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.721 align:middle line:84%
and all the different
types of mental diseases

00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:90%
that we see today.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:90%


00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Every experience
creates scar on the mind,

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.000 align:middle line:90%
impression on the mind.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Every part creates
groove on the brain.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.010 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So total number of
scar is samskara.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Samskaras are like
this great storehouse

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:84%
of ideas and thoughts
and impressions

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:25.180 align:middle line:84%
that can become associated
mistakenly with the self.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:10%
And then, one finds oneself
wanting things, thinking

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:10%
things, and spontaneously
acting in ways

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:10%
which really have no basis.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>We can always create
new impressions.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:84%
We can always create
new samskaras.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we
go more deeper, we

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.340 align:middle line:90%
go into the subconscious mind.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.900 align:middle line:90%
We go into the hard disk.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And we try to look, what are
the viruses in the hard disk?

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And how can I clean up those
viruses and put new programs?

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:84%
What we emphasize
more is on putting

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:90%
new program or new impressions.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Samskaras can be built
up through education,

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:84%
through learning, through
inquiring, through discipline.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And word discipline
means to learn.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And one who is
learning is disciple.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.915 align:middle line:84%
So we all are the disciple of
life, and life is our teacher.

00:37:22.915 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The right lifestyle
means the lifestyle

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:84%
which is good for my body,
which is good for my mind, which

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is good for my senses,
which is good for my soul.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:90%
Complete, holistic lifestyle.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.080 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see
the underlying factor,

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.380 align:middle line:84%
then it is our
lifestyle or the food.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Food becomes a part of
blood, part of plasma,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:90%
part of nervous system.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Food nourishes the mind.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Food becomes consciousness.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why food is very
important, what type of food

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.240 align:middle line:90%
we eat.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it will not
nourish only the body,

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
but it will become mind
and the consciousness.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>In Ayurveda, we
say that all people

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:84%
should eat in a clean
way, but at the same time,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.750 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's most suited to
their individual constitution.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>The food you're
eating might be

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:84%
very good for your
physical body.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.900 align:middle line:84%
It might be full of
proteins, carbohydrates,

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and all those
vitamins and minerals.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.460 align:middle line:10%
But it could be causing
disturbments or agitation.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Anything that we eat can be
classified into these three

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:84%
categories, sattvic,
rajasic, and tamasic.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:84%
If the food that we
are eating is sattvic,

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that will enhance the
clarity of my mind.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:84%
That will enhance
the knowledge system.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.975 align:middle line:84%
That will help me discriminate
between what is good for me

00:38:58.975 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:90%
and what is not good for me.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:10%
But if I'm eating food which
is more rajasic and tamasic,

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:10%
it will create more confusion,
negativity, aggression,

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:10%
irritation, more
depression in my mind.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Ayurveda currently
uses approximately 1,200

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:31.230 align:middle line:84%
individual plant-based products
that include different plant

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:84%
parts, such as leaves and
stems and roots and seeds.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>The category of
plant-based medicines

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that are prescribed
for mental diseases

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.275 align:middle line:84%
are known as the
medhya rasayana drugs.

00:39:46.275 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>The medhya rasayanas
enhance biological nourishment

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and increase the oxygen
supply to the brain.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years
of use has shown

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:84%
that these medicinal
herbs address

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
mental disease, such
as depression, anxiety,

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and other mood disorders without
the side effects often seen

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.855 align:middle line:84%
with the use of Western
psychiatric medicine.

00:40:09.855 --> 00:40:15.890 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Oiling in the body is a
very important procedure

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:21.770 align:middle line:84%
which also connects
with the mind

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and helps to enhance compassion.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:84%
The word in Sanskrit
for oil is sneha.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And sneha also means love.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.435 align:middle line:84%
Love can heal all problems,
specifically mental problems.

00:40:35.435 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>It stimulates nerve endings,
and their nerve ending

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:90%
releases certain neuropeptides.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.885 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
same neuropeptides

00:40:45.885 --> 00:40:48.065 align:middle line:84%
that are released in your
central nervous system.

00:40:48.065 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Panchakarma, Ayurveda's
detoxification program,

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.260 align:middle line:84%
includes treatments such as
abhyanga and shirodhara, which

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.300 align:middle line:90%
utilize oils.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.840 align:middle line:84%
These treatments balance
neurotransmission

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.970 align:middle line:84%
while also detoxifying
body and mind,

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:84%
removing obstacles
interfering with good health,

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and giving the capacity
for clear thinking.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:21.245 align:middle line:84%
>>In much of India, yoga and
Ayurveda are taught together.

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:22.620 align:middle line:84%
They're not separate
disciplines.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It coordinates the functions
of the muscles and the nerves,

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.350 align:middle line:84%
both the central nervous system
and the peripheral nervous

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:84%
system, into one
coordinated function.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Unfortunately, now most
people think yoga is gymnastics,

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and yoga is some kind
of physical exercise.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is a complete
system like Ayurveda.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, yoga leads
us to that state of mind

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:10%
when the mind is completely
free of all the citta

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:10%
vritti, the desires
which are actually

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.125 align:middle line:10%
arising from your
subconscious mind.

00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>When certain postures
are adopted and held along

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:84%
with the correct
breathing techniques,

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:84%
the channels that contain
specific doshas can open up.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:10%
And doshas which may have
been stuck or maintained

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.090 align:middle line:10%
inappropriately
in certain tissues

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:10%
or in certain parts of mind
can be released spontaneously

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.505 align:middle line:10%
and experienced by the adept.

00:42:32.505 --> 00:42:36.870 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:40.170 align:middle line:84%
In meditation practices,
we are instructed

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.370 align:middle line:90%
not to label the thoughts.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:10%
As a treatment modality
in Ayurvedic psychiatry,

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.300 align:middle line:10%
we teach people indeed
to label the thoughts

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:56.830 align:middle line:10%
that they see as they
arise as one of two things,

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:10%
either useful or positive,
or not useful or negative.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And simply by seeing
the thought processes

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and being able to label
them as one or the other

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
not only creates in itself
a calm state of mind,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.440 align:middle line:84%
but it actually opens
the door for the removal

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.740 align:middle line:84%
of deeper emotional
stains on the mind, which

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.018 align:middle line:84%
can lead to the cure of many
kinds of mental conditions.

00:43:27.018 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:90%


00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Thousands of
years of experience

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.990 align:middle line:84%
has shown that these Ayurvedic
treatments have the ability

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.080 align:middle line:84%
to significantly
improve the patient's

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.753 align:middle line:84%
overall mental and
physical health.

00:43:40.753 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>These last two
decades in America,

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:84%
they say mind-body medicine,
mind-body medicine.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, this
mind-body medicine

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.120 align:middle line:90%
is from thousands of years.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Still, they are
missing the spirit.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Mind, body, and spirit--
that also needs some healing.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>The reason I
picked psychiatry,

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.380 align:middle line:84%
even within Western
medicine, was

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that it seemed to be the
discipline that actually seemed

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to come the closest to
at least acknowledging

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.140 align:middle line:84%
a connection between
mind and body.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:10%
And it seemed to
me that among all

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.820 align:middle line:10%
of those other alternative
systems of medicine,

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda was really
the most complete

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:10%
in how mind and
body are related,

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:37.810 align:middle line:10%
how human beings interact
with their environment,

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:42.050 align:middle line:10%
how the environment
actually impacts us.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.440 align:middle line:10%
>>One of the issues with
using conventional treatments

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.940 align:middle line:10%
like psychotherapy
or medications

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.100 align:middle line:10%
is that both require the patient
to have the help of an expert

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.440 align:middle line:10%
to aid in their healing.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda empowers patients,
giving them control and input

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.080 align:middle line:84%
into their own healing through
proper lifestyle, diet, detox

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.785 align:middle line:84%
and rejuvenation
programs, pranayama, yoga,

00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:05.410 align:middle line:90%
and meditation.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that it's very
important that we not

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.370 align:middle line:84%
stigmatize people for
using these medications

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:19.580 align:middle line:84%
when it's appropriate and when
they are benefiting from it,

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and when it really
allows that person

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.570 align:middle line:90%
to adapt to their environment.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>One reason that more people
that need these medications

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.870 align:middle line:84%
are receiving
treatment is better

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.580 align:middle line:84%
training in
recognizing symptoms.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.017 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
growing concern

00:45:34.017 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that psychiatric medication is
often prescribed unnecessarily.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>I do think that there's a
real problem when society wants

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to solve every little
experience that

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.630 align:middle line:90%
is unpleasant by medicating it.

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>The mental attitude of
people in this country

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and the pharmaceutical
industry is

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that for every twisted
molecule, there

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:90%
is a drug that will untwist it.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:09.260 align:middle line:84%
But any child that is unruly,
hyperactive, can't sit still,

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.310 align:middle line:90%
distracted-- wham.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:13.050 align:middle line:84%
They get slapped
this label and get

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.460 align:middle line:90%
this pill put in their mouth.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
kids do not need it.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>When we start looking
at other emotions

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:30.190 align:middle line:84%
like anger, sadness, anxiety,
and so on, the idea of a cure

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.770 align:middle line:84%
starts to become
less and less clear.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.890 align:middle line:90%
What exactly does that mean?

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that we're trying
to strive towards a situation

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:84%
where none of us are ever
angry, none of us are ever sad,

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.920 align:middle line:90%
none of us are ever anxious?

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we mean by a
cure for mental health issues?

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Ayurveda believes
these emotions often

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:55.380 align:middle line:90%
exist for a reason.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And there is a role
and a value in working

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:01.350 align:middle line:84%
through our struggles and
suffering, that we actually

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.800 align:middle line:84%
become richer for being able
to do that self-inquiry,

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
that suffering is not

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.000 align:middle line:90%
synonymous with disorder.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Suffering and
depression, for example,

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.290 align:middle line:90%
are not one and the same.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:19.390 align:middle line:84%
An individual can suffer
and not be depressed.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:21.880 align:middle line:84%
There can be a lot to be
gained by suffering sometimes,

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:84%
in terms of understanding
our own humanity

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and our connection to
generations and generations

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that have gone before us
and that will come after us.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:35.060 align:middle line:90%


00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>In the Ayurvedic
view, it's not

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the culture that's causing
the mental disease, but rather

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.500 align:middle line:90%
the other way around.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the distortions in
the mind that is actually

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:53.240 align:middle line:90%
creating our misguided culture.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>We tend to limit
ourselves by identifying

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.860 align:middle line:84%
with certain external
circumstances,

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or with how tall or
short our body is,

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.705 align:middle line:84%
or how well we
performed on an exam.

00:48:03.705 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Not only just
becoming successful

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.140 align:middle line:84%
in our materialistic
world or becoming famous

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.950 align:middle line:90%
or becoming rich.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.170 align:middle line:90%
This is fine.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a part of Ayurveda.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:84%
We do talk about
economic development.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.130 align:middle line:84%
What we also talk
about in Ayurveda

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.780 align:middle line:84%
is how do you become
self-realized?

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:90%
How do you know the real you?

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>In the vision
of the Vedas, it's

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:33.810 align:middle line:84%
actually the birthright
of every human being

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.740 align:middle line:90%
to realize our essential nature.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.205 align:middle line:90%
And our essential nature is joy.

00:48:39.205 --> 00:48:41.800 align:middle line:10%
Our essential nature is wisdom.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:10%
Our essential nature is peace.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>The real goal, from
an Ayurvedic standpoint,

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is to have a vital and long life
which will allow an individual

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.830 align:middle line:84%
to really seek moksa, or
spiritual enlightenment.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>If I could tell a young person
one thing that would start them

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:07.970 align:middle line:84%
on the journey towards healing,
it would probably be this.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Develop some type of practice
that allows you to turn inward,

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.330 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to look
inside yourself and develop

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:20.580 align:middle line:84%
the skill and the
patience and the tolerance

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to actually be
alone with yourself.

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Mind is a beautifully innocent
instrument of experience.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.720 align:middle line:84%
We should develop
friendship with the mind.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my mind, you
are my best friend.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:36.635 align:middle line:90%
You are my chum.

00:49:36.635 --> 00:49:37.510 align:middle line:90%
You are my companion.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>If we can engage our young
people in the fascinating study

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:50.350 align:middle line:84%
of discovering the true
nature of their mind,

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:54.480 align:middle line:84%
initially by simply
witnessing their own thoughts,

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.660 align:middle line:84%
then we have a chance
of maybe reversing

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.360 align:middle line:84%
some of the cultural
harms that we see today.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>How do you become
self-realized?

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.970 align:middle line:90%
How do you know the real you?

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Then, based on
that consciousness,

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.410 align:middle line:90%
you then connect with your body.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
You then connect with
your outer world,

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.840 align:middle line:84%
connect with your friends,
connect with the universe.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.680 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Although it seems that we
are separate individuals,

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.940 align:middle line:84%
it's all interconnected,
interpenetrated, whole.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:44.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the knowledge
that will disinfect

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.740 align:middle line:90%
the mind from its ignorance.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:52.150 align:middle line:90%


00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>One day, sit down
for five minutes

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.540 align:middle line:90%
and see where are you going.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Which way are you heading?

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.291 align:middle line:90%
What are you trying to achieve?

00:51:02.291 --> 00:51:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Are you really trying to
become happy in your life?

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to just
necessarily follow the crowd.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You just have to follow
your own inner instinct.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Try to sit down, relax, and
find time to be with yourself.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:36.682 align:middle line:90%

Attention Deficit Disorder,

ADD.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.700 align:middle line:10%
And of course, as a
young mom, I wanted

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:02.330 align:middle line:10%
to look into what my options
were, other than medication.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>It was really just
basic principles

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.350 align:middle line:90%
of mother nature and physics.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It just made sense.

>>When I first left football,
my body was a wreck.

00:52:12.145 --> 00:52:16.090 align:middle line:84%
My emotions were a wreck, and
my life was a wreck, basically.

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.540 align:middle line:10%
Just eating the right
foods and doing yoga really

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.790 align:middle line:10%
helped change things
around very quickly.

doesn't matter.

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:31.690 align:middle line:10%
As long as you're
human, it applies.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>I looked into all kinds of
different healing modalities.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I found Ayurveda,
I found a lot of solutions.

money and I had a lot of fame,

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Over the past seven
or eight years

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in studying yoga, Ayurveda, and
meditation, I found my path.

And now, my life has
improved so much.
