00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:84%

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:10%
Catherine regressed back to
a time before she was born.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:10%
>> She said, I don't
know what this is,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:10%
but I could already
see it was intense.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:10%
It was cathartic.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:10%
It was emotional.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.643 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know why--

00:06:14.643 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Because when
you're hypnotized,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:10%
you remember everything
you're saying.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, It's not something
that you forget.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:90%
You remember it.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So she probably couldn't
believe it herself.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> For her, it was
easier than for me--

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>> To believe it.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.677 align:middle line:84%
>> --because it was so--
yeah, to believe it--

00:06:29.677 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:90%
it was so intense for her.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:10%
She was experiencing
it with emotions,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:10%
and visually, and
sounds, and other

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:10%
senses that it became
easier over the weeks that

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:10%
followed for her to
change her worldview.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:10%
But for me, I needed
more because I

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:10%
was such a skeptic, so
left brain, so academic.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:10%
And I started already explaining
it away like, oh, maybe she

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:10%
saw movies, or read
about this, or maybe it's

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:10%
the collective unconscious
that the psychoanalyst Carl

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:10%
Jung wrote about or
something else going on.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But when she came
back in the next week,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:90%
her symptoms were disappearing.

So anything pet statements
or part of your induction,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:10%
it's OK to emphasize
and repeat it

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:10%
over and over two or
three times and then

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.580 align:middle line:10%
bring it up again later.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:10%

me standing on a stage.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:90%
It's like the Hollywood Bowl.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking out at the
vast seating that's there.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:10%
So if you can picture and
imagine the Hollywood Bowl

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:10%
where we would normally
be in the audience looking

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:10%
at the stage watching an artist,
it's actually reversed for me.

I'm actually the
artist looking out.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:10%
And in the first
several sections

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:10%
are all of my spirit
guides, guardian angels,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:10%
those part of my life.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:10%
And then in the
audience behind that

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:10%
are just people that
are interested in me

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:10%
and listening to
what I have to say.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:10%
You know, like the bowl,
it's got a semicircle.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
in particular,

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.575 align:middle line:90%
some issue being discussed?

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm actually presenting what
my next life is going to be,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:84%
much like you would do if
you were defending a doctoral

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:90%
thesis.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And all the
professors are there.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're asking you questions
like "Why'd you choose this?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose?

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:10%
What kind of
studying did you do?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:10%
What were the tests?"

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:10%
You know, those types
of inquiry questions.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:10%
And I'm busy answering
those questions

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:10%
about why I chose
this particular body

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:10%
in this lifetime,
and my parents,

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:10%
and what I'm going to be doing.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.945 align:middle line:10%
>> Interesting.

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So while you're discussing
this life to come,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:90%
how do you feel about it?

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Are you eager to
get started or doe

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
you have some reluctance,
or even trepidation,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps you have
mixed feelings?

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:10%
>> No, none of that.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:10%
Very confident, feel
very comfortable.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:10%
I've done my research.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:10%
I've done my studying.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:10%
I know exactly what I
want and what this life

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:10%
is going to do for me.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:10%
And so all the
questions I'm handling

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:10%
with ease, and with comfort,
and eloquent in my responses

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:10%
and details when I need to be.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:10%
>> So in a few
moments at my count,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:10%
we're going to move backward
in time to your most recent

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:10%
previous lifetime or to
some other past lifetime,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:10%
incarnation, that's of most
value for us to explore now.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Already shifting.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Just choose one, day
time or night time.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's day time.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Day time.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you inside or outside?

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm outside.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Outside.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Standing on the street.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> On the street.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.395 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a girl.

00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And about what's your age?

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
What's the number that
pops into your head

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
as you stand on
the street there?

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Nine or 10.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, so you're a young girl.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.615 align:middle line:90%
And what's the year?

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.938 align:middle line:84%
When you're standing
here in this--

00:10:39.938 --> 00:10:43.729 align:middle line:90%
>> 19-- 1943.

00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:44.715 align:middle line:90%
>> '43.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Germany occupies Copenhagen.
Hitler's troops disembarking

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:10%
act of aggression-- the invasion
of peaceful and innocent

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Denmark.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis, who are pleased
to describe themselves

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
as protectors, succeeded
in carrying out

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
this plan of General
Keitel's like clockwork.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.094 align:middle line:84%
The whole country was in
their hands within 24 hours.

00:11:09.094 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:84%
All right, then, this
is what I want to do.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Without pain or
discomfort, I want

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:84%
us to move to the very last
day of your life as Helga.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You'll not yet
have crossed over.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to feel
any pain or discomfort.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.750 align:middle line:84%
You can rise above the scene
or situation, just to observe.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But I want it to be the very
last day of your life as Helga.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So on the count of
three, you'll be there.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, and 3.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.207 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm outside.

00:11:42.207 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Outside.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And so how old are
you on this day?

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> 10.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, then.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm standing.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Standing.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
What happens to cause
your life to end?

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.575 align:middle line:84%
>> It was like I'm in a
camp, a concentration camp.

00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So how long have you
been in the camp?

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Not very long.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's move forward to
the moment after death.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So where are you in
relation to your body now?

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Are you above it
or off to the side?

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.342 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm floating above it.

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Floating above it.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Could I ask you a few questions?

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
How did you die?

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.905 align:middle line:90%
>> I was shot.

00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Shot.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.705 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:40.705 --> 00:12:45.345 align:middle line:84%
How do feel about
leaving that life?

00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's kind
of-- it's sad.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So brief, so short.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you know the name of
this place, this camp where

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.998 align:middle line:90%
you ended your life?

00:13:00.998 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Dachau.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Dachau, factory of horrors.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Mere mention one of the oldest
of the Nazi prison camps.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It is known that from
1941-1944, up to 30,000 people

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:90%
were entombed here at one time.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And 30,000 were present.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.858 align:middle line:90%
>> There's just so many bodies.

00:13:26.858 --> 00:13:27.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:13:27.812 --> 00:13:30.674 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot of bodies.

00:13:30.674 --> 00:13:33.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very hard to move.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.115 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very hard to move?

00:13:37.115 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Hypnotherapy and
Parkinson's, my colleague,

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:10%
a successful screenwriter, has
Parkinson's and volunteered

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:10%
to see if she could learn about
the source of her affliction

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:10%
via hypnotherapy.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:10%
She was teaching a class at
USC film school when we met.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very nervous
because I feel like I--

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Do me a favor.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:10%
Before you say that
again would you just

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.093 align:middle line:10%
ask that question
once more, Scott?

00:14:05.093 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I forgot what
the question was.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you want?

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:10%
Or just repeat that-- what
am I looking for today?

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.382 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you looking for
in this experience here.

00:14:14.382 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this the mic over here?

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I should just leave it.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you want me to wear it?

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Just leave it is fine.

00:14:18.122 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm looking for answers, because
I feel like I know I know

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:10%
the answers already, but I feel
like I feel sort of ambushed

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:10%
off my path, you know,
with this Parkinson's.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's like it's kicked
me out of being human.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.205 align:middle line:90%
And I don't feel human.

00:14:39.205 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
back to feeling

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.100 align:middle line:90%
like I know what I'm doing.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.505 align:middle line:10%
>> Closed now.

00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:10%
Eyes closed.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:10%
Relaxing, releasing.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:10%
Letting go.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.715 align:middle line:10%
Beautiful.

00:14:58.715 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I've got some questions.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:10%
And a lot have to do
with this condition

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:10%
that she's been afflicted with.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:10%
David, would you address
these questions for us?

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> She wants to know
am I on my path?

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>> She's on her
path in many ways.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
She has spiritual resources
she doesn't even know she has.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:10%
She's not tapped into them yet.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:10%
>> How can she do that?

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:10%
>> By filling her heart with
compassion for herself mainly.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:10%
Forgive herself for things
that she's done in the past.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't have to
live in secret anymore.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:10%
She can be out loud and bold
and push past smallness.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:10%
That's why we presented her
with this challenge of getting

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:10%
small, this condition.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me more.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>> She needs to push past
it by tuning in spiritually

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
and realizing who she is.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.631 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I'm
being pulled away--

00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:13.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:13.986 --> 00:16:15.399 align:middle line:90%
>> --off to the right.

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> As you're being pulled
away off to the right there.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't see any people.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm flying
over the city.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.654 align:middle line:84%
So you can kind of look and
see the earth below you?

00:16:33.654 --> 00:16:34.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:37.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:41.771 align:middle line:84%
>> And I see a place with like
white pillars or something.

00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And like a very, very blue sky
up against the white pillars.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:90%
And there's a like a name.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Tell me the name.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It's something like "Longda."

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.938 align:middle line:84%
>> How does he
communicate to you?

00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Just welcome, like coming
back, like welcome back,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:90%
or welcome back.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about
this soul's performance

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.849 align:middle line:90%
in a lifetime as Helga, Longda?

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
What about Helga?

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Helga dark, dark.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Helga was dark?

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The whole--

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The whole life time?

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Life dark.

00:17:34.932 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So why did Randol
choose the lifetime

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:90%
as Helga, this short, dark life?

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> To see the darkness.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> To see in darkness?

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
What's the value in
seeing the darkness

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.331 align:middle line:90%
for a soul like Randol?

00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There's so much light,
you forget the dark.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the purpose in
having challenges such as this?

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:90%
How does this help us develop?

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Patience and understanding.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It's to learn-- it's
about trust and patience.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we take him to a place
to cleanse him of this darkness

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.066 align:middle line:90%
and the doubt?

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>> The soul--

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The river.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> The soul river.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go there.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So do you like jump in
or do you sit there?

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> We will walk in together.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are you with?

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.622 align:middle line:90%
>> The elders.

00:18:36.622 --> 00:18:38.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:43.217 align:middle line:90%
>> The water is to forget.

00:18:43.217 --> 00:18:45.602 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:47.987 align:middle line:90%
>> The water is to wash clean.

00:18:47.987 --> 00:18:49.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Is someone speaking to you?

00:18:49.743 --> 00:18:50.665 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm just--

00:18:50.665 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:90%
I am aware that burned my soul.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:90%
That time burned my soul.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.496 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:57.496 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And I never knew the
darkness could be so dark.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Can this condition
be reversed--

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:10%
arrested or reversed?

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:10%
She's got to look at this
as a spiritual crisis,

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:10%
not as a physical
crisis, and not

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:10%
be apologetic for what she
does, or what she says,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:10%
or how she moves--

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:10%
how she moves in the world.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:10%
>> So what precipitated
this illness in her?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Secretiveness.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:10%
>> So tell us once more how
can she heal and overcome this

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:10%
condition?

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:10%
>> She needs to
reconnect to the light,

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:10%
to everything that's light, and
everything that's good about

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:10%
her and strong about her.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it that Howard's been
brought to this session today?

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
What is it that he really needs
to get from this experience?

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> This was part of the
plan that you created.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.552 align:middle line:90%
No one wrote this for you.

00:19:54.552 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:90%
You wrote it for yourself.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.655 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of when
I came into this body.

00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It's that "wow,"
[LAUGHS] the knowing.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.515 align:middle line:84%
This is the flow
of energy endless.

00:20:10.515 --> 00:20:15.488 align:middle line:84%
This is where you
came from to know.

00:20:15.488 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>> To know where you came from?

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in this
life and all that.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Number four, back into the
body gracefully now, gently.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.514 align:middle line:10%
Now when you're ready,
number five, number five,

00:20:34.514 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:10%
eyes open now.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Back in the here and now.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That was fun.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:90%
That was like a wild ride.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:90%
That was really fun.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:10%
>> My friend opted to do brain
surgery recommended by her

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:10%
doctors for her Parkinson's.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:10%
It helped end her
shaking, but robbed her

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:10%
of her ability to speak.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:10%
She's in rehab trying
to gain her voice back.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I found interesting
and what captured me was that

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
over thousands of cases was a
consistency of the reporting.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:10%
It didn't matter whether a
client came to me with a,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:10%
you know, deep, religious belief
system or a lack of belief

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.970 align:middle line:10%
in anything or any philosophical
persuasion in between.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Once we had them
in deep hypnosis,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
they all told me
the same things.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:10%
>> In they REM
state of hypnosis,

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:10%
you will hear every
sound around you.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And it will sound louder
than it usually does.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a state of
being stoned where

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:90%
auditory stuff is more vivid.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So you'll say, I
can't be hypnotized

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
because I'm hearing
everything very acutely.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
you're not hypnotized.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:90%
It means you're in a REM state.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Also you may feel that
your eyelids feel scratchy

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:90%
and you want to open your eyes.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:90%
You'll say, I'm not hypnotized.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I want to open my eyes.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Well you're in
rapid eye movement

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and that makes your
eyelids feel scratchy.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why you want
to open your eyes.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So if your eyelids do
feel scratchy, just say,

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's rapid eye movement.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Open your eyes for a moment
and close them again.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is do not
take this too seriously.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
If you say to yourself
I'm going to wait

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
until a true answer about
my real past life comes in,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to take this thing
whatever my head's making up,

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
you're in trouble,
because as far as I know,

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:84%
there is no true past life,
I mean, in that sense.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask questions.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And a answer will
pop into your mind.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And you just go with
the answer, that's all.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
your right brain.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Now your left brain will say--

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, look at
your feet, what

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:90%
are you wearing on your feet?

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And your left brain is going to
see, well, boots will flash in.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And you left brain said
they were boots in the 1500s

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:90%
or was that's the 1600s?

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I better change
it and make it slippers.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:10%
And this is your
left brain censoring

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:10%
and trying to make it
correct historically.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.370 align:middle line:10%
And this, of course, is a mess
because what we're trying to do

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:10%
is just get these flashes
from the right brain.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:10%
So your left brain will go along
on the trip and let it observe.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:10%
And it can comment and
say, oh, stupid you.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:10%
You always think this.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:10%
Or it's going to
say you made it up.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.060 align:middle line:10%
You can't write this down
because you just made it up.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And am I hypnotized?

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not hypnotized.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I can hear that person
snoring next to me.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:10%
Why doesn't that
person stop snoring?

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:10%
All these things are going
to go on in your mind.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:10%
That's all right, because
we need your left brain

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:10%
there to remember it.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:10%
But it's the right
brain kind of flashing

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.545 align:middle line:10%
that will begin to happen.

00:23:51.545 --> 00:23:52.920 align:middle line:10%
And after this
first trip, you'll

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:10%
begin to recognize whether your
answer is coming immediately

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:10%
in the form of an impression
or whether it's something

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:10%
you're thinking out logically.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:10%
So those are the instructions.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:10%
Do not take it seriously.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.870 align:middle line:10%
We are playing at this.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:10%
Do not be worried about
rapid eye movement or eyes

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:10%
feeling scratchy.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's perfectly all right to
shift and change your posture.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:10%
You do not need to
lie on your back

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:10%
if it makes you uncomfortable.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
You can turn if your
back starts hurting you.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to lose
god if you breathe out

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:90%
of the wrong nostril.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:10%
>> We get flashbacks that break
through that amnesiac block

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:10%
in different ways
with different people.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking, now,
about folks who

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:10%
have had no LBL experiences.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:90%
They're just ordinary people.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't even maybe
know about our work.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.705 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly they're in a classroom
in their dreams or in a flash

00:24:51.705 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and they can't figure out--
that's a strange image.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Where's that coming from?

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Part Two-- Hacking the
Afterlife through Mediumship.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:10%
After Michael Newton passed
away, he stopped by to chat

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:10%
with medium Jennifer Shaffer.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:10%
We are in a noisy restaurant.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:10%
I had not brought a camera,
so I had to use a cell phone.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So our question to
Michael was you just

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:84%
showed up spontaneously at
our lunch in Manhattan Beach.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You're taking notes on
how to make it easier

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
to communicate from over there
to here or from over here

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:90%
to there?

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>> From where I am.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking
notes from there

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
as to be able to communicate
better to people over there.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, very good.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.575 align:middle line:84%
Michael, let me ask you,
why did you show up today?

00:25:39.575 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Did you show up to tell us that?

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like noetic science,
but from the other side.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, noetic science
on the other side.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.110 align:middle line:90%
All right, very good.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody can
speak to other side.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And that no one does not not
have the capabilities to do so.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:90%
I will quote-- can I quote you?

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And that everyone
should start.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They should start
bringing them in closer.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
He showed me like both the
dimensions-- of this gazillion.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
He showed me like both
the dimensions of it

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.776 align:middle line:84%
being like at a dinner
table where people

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:12.410 align:middle line:90%
are translucent to each other.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But he wanted to
mention the other,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:84%
but yet you still have the
energies to call people in.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked if he had a
formula to help people speak

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to their loved ones
no longer here.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:10%
Michael said, say their name,
ask them a question I asked,

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:10%
but how do we know
the answers are real?

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:10%
He said when you get
a reply before you

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:10%
can ask the question, you'll
know you have a connection.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.760 align:middle line:10%
Luana Anders in "Dementia 13"
directed by her friend Francis

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:10%
Ford Coppola.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> John, that will is no good.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Your mother is still alive.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:10%
We can talk her
into changing it.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>> We met in film school at USC.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:10%
A writing instructor assigned
us the same screenplay

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:10%
to breakdown.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.517 align:middle line:10%
We were together for
20 years after meeting.

00:26:58.517 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>> You're rowing too hard.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Let me row.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You're concerned
about me, Louise.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Is it my heart?

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Luana was in over 30 feature
films and 300 TV episodes.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:10%
She began conducting a
class from the "Flipside"

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.210 align:middle line:10%
to help those over
there communicate

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:10%
via Jennifer Shaffer.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.987 align:middle line:90%
>> John.

00:27:18.987 --> 00:27:19.787 align:middle line:90%
John!

00:27:19.787 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Awake!

00:27:27.306 --> 00:27:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:10%
>> One of her most iconic
roles is playing the girlfriend

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:10%
of Peter Fonda in "Easy Rider."

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.747 align:middle line:10%
Ironically, her first
boyfriend was Dennis Hopper.

00:27:40.747 --> 00:27:43.232 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:43.232 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.730 align:middle line:10%
I was with Luana when she
passed and started hearing

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:10%
from her via dreams and
visitations starting the day

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:10%
before she passed.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:10%
As noted in "Flipside,"
after she passed in 1996,

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:10%
she started showing
up in dreams, visions,

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:10%
and to members of my family.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:15.212 align:middle line:84%
I figured, if she can come here,
then why can't I visit her?

00:28:15.212 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:10%
Her frequent visits to
me from the flipside

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:10%
became the basis for the
book and the film "Flipside--

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:10%
A Tourist's Guide on How
to Navigate the Afterlife."

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.992 align:middle line:90%

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:40.084 align:middle line:10%
>> And the Oscar goes to Jack's
Nicholson in "As Good As It

00:28:40.084 --> 00:28:40.884 align:middle line:10%
Gets."

00:28:40.884 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Jack Nicholson has been
nominated for 11 Academy

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Awards.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:90%
This is his third win.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'd like to thank--

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to thank everybody here
tonight for looking so good.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to dedicate this to
Miles Davis, Robert Mitchum,

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Shorty Smith, Joe Vitrano,
Ray Cramer, Rupert Crosse, JT

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Walsh, and Luana Anders.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They're not here anymore,
but they're in my heart.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.530 align:middle line:10%
And I thank you very much.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The other night
just by chance,

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:10%
I happened to catch a
psychic medium on television,

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:27.650 align:middle line:10%
John Edwards.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:10%
And he took a phone call.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:10%
And a woman said can you
be in touch with my mother?

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:36.970 align:middle line:10%
And he looked down.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And he concentrated
for a while and he

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:10%
said, did she die of
congestive heart failure?

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:10%
And the phone caller
said, yes, she did.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:10%
He thought again
for a long moment.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:10%
And he said toward
the end of her life,

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:10%
did you give her a
small Christmas tree?

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:10%
And the woman, again,
said, yes, yes.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.210 align:middle line:10%
And then she told the story
of why she gave her mother

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:10%
the small Christmas tree.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:10%
Now people looking at
this could think, well,

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:10%
that must be proof that
there is life after death.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And then other people could
look at that same thing

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:10%
and say this is a scam.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:10%
It's impossible.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:10%
It's a trick.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.000 align:middle line:10%
It's an arranged phone call.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:10%
It's something other than
what it appears to be.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:10%
I have friends that are
shocked that I haven't made up

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:10%
my mind on what I
believe, that I am still

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:10%
open to the possibility
that there is a possibility

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:10%
that we are dealing with
some communication here.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:10%
We are the only species who know
that our time as human beings

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:10%
will come to an end.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:10%
And this impacts
on our lives more

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:10%
than we probably
realize that it does.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:10%
So tonight, for the
third time on this show,

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:10%
the most celebrated
psychic medium in America,

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:10%
James Van Praagh--

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:10%
Hi, James, nice
to see you again.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, Charles.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.610 align:middle line:10%
Good to see you again.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
chat a little while.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:10%
And we have an
audience here tonight.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:10%
And we will take a phone
call for James Van Praagh.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Richard from Los
Angeles, go ahead please.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, James.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:10%
You're amazing.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you, Richard.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.620 align:middle line:10%
>> But much better
than a sitcom.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm calling about my friend
Luana who passed away

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:10%
a couple of years ago.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Luano, this is a male?

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Luana-- L-U-A-N-A.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Luana, Luana.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.330 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.683 align:middle line:10%
Hold on.

00:31:49.683 --> 00:31:52.100 align:middle line:10%
Well first of all, let me say,
what I'm picking up is you.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm tuning in to
you very strong.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:10%
And you have a lot of
creative energy yourself.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:10%
And you're a person who
does several things at once.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:10%
Now hold on.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:10%
Was this girl ever talk
to you about your career?

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh sure.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Because she laughs a lot.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:10%
And she has a great
sense of humor.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.532 align:middle line:10%
And I would know
her by her laughter,

00:32:11.532 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:10%
like a certain way of
laughing with this woman.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:10%
All right?

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.190 align:middle line:10%
And she's talking to
me about your career.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:10%
And she's laughing with me here.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.810 align:middle line:10%
She's saying you
change all the time.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:10%
This thing and then you're one
thing and then another thing.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And she said he could
never make up his mind.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's true.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>> You understand?

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:10%
And said you need
to get yourself

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:10%
your feet on the floor.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.590 align:middle line:10%
You need to get to-- you need
to get yourself grounded,

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:10%
and steady, and focused.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:10%
And she said she tried to focus
with you, tried getting focus.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:10%
Now did she have trouble
with her weight before--

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.518 align:middle line:10%
when she was alive at all?

00:32:45.518 --> 00:32:47.810 align:middle line:10%
>> No, not really so much
her weight, but she was thin.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:48.610 align:middle line:10%
>> She was thin.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:10%
I feel like she was over
concerned about that

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:10%
or she was-- she thought
about that a lot.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.342 align:middle line:10%
Was also-- she's talking to me
also about going on a trip or--

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:58.550 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what this means.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:10%
With you going away on a
trip and talking about this.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:10%
>> OK?

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I just recently
came back from Europe.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Is that what
she's talking about?

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, she said she
went on a trip with you.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.860 align:middle line:10%
So this is what she said to me.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly
how she said it.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:12.620 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if she meant that.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.370 align:middle line:10%
She said I went
on a trip with him

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:10%
and she had a good
time, a good time.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:10%
She likes to dance.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Does she?

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, she does.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And she talks about
dancing here with you.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, great.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:10%
>> She's also talking
to me about you--

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:10%
stop having to worry--

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.890 align:middle line:10%
worrying about your hair.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:10%
And she said he's been
worrying about his hair lately.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Huh.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.570 align:middle line:10%
Do you understand that?

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.770 align:middle line:10%
>> It's just getting grayer.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.145 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, but she said he was
worried about it and he wanted

00:33:36.145 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:10%
to do something with his hair
and changed it in some way

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:10%
recently.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you understand that?

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I do.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.898 align:middle line:10%
And she's giggling about this.

00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:10%
She said you're
going to change that.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, there are some
great photographs of--

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:10%
everyone has
photographs-- but she's

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:10%
telling me that you were
very concerned about having

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:10%
a particular photograph after
she died of you together.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:58.610 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.655 align:middle line:10%
>> And it gets very
emotional with her.

00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:10%
I also want to ask you,
did you put this photograph

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.300 align:middle line:10%
on a refrigerator or was
there one on the refrigerator?

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, because she gets
very emotional when she talks

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And she said she loves that.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.320 align:middle line:90%
She loves that picture.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:10%
And it almost describes
the two of you together,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:10%
your relationship, your
friendship, all right?

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:10%
>> Hmm.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:19.683 align:middle line:10%
>> One more thing--

00:34:19.683 --> 00:34:21.350 align:middle line:10%
she's talking about
a collection of-- it

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.560 align:middle line:10%
sounds weird-- either shot
glasses, or drinking glasses,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.010 align:middle line:10%
or mugs.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:26.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Martini glasses.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Martini glasses.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:10%
Do you collect these?

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I do.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:30.170 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.739 align:middle line:10%
And she's talking about that
and she's laughing her head off.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:33.539 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:35.315 align:middle line:10%
>> Can she say,
James, how she passed?

00:34:35.315 --> 00:34:38.400 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>> She's telling me that this
happened very quickly with her

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.872 align:middle line:10%
passing.

00:34:41.872 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know, but she
said it happened very fast.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.159 align:middle line:10%
It's funny, but she
said, I want to think

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:10%
of the good times, not the bad.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Hmm.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.593 align:middle line:10%
>> So I don't know, but
she's saying it was--

00:34:53.593 --> 00:34:55.760 align:middle line:10%
she's going on about it
wasn't good, it wasn't good,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't good.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.340 align:middle line:10%
>> How is she?

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.180 align:middle line:10%
Where is she?

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Hold on.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.788 align:middle line:10%
Let me just keep on getting
more information for you,

00:35:00.788 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:10%
because I want--

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:10%
was she killed at all?

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:10%
>> She wasn't killed.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:10%
But I feel like for some reason
she dies and she's surprised.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:11.870 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that weird.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.580 align:middle line:10%
I get that she's surprised.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:10%
Hold on.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.620 align:middle line:10%
She's telling me to let
you know and she's going on

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:10%
about how happy she is now.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:90%
She's happier now.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.020 align:middle line:90%
She didn't expect to die young.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:90%
She died young.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:10%
And she didn't expect that.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:10%
And she said she's right
behind you right now.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.480 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHING].

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And when you hear-- when
you feel the hairs on the back

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:10%
of your neck stand up, it's her.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.280 align:middle line:10%
Also did she have a cat?

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Who?

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Did Luana, this
girl, have a cat?

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, she did.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And were you concerned
about her cat if she died?

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying you wanted
to put it in a good place.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.690 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to keep
it for a little while

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and did something with
this cat, she's telling me.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, very
important for her.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:10%
And she wants you to
take care of her kitty.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:10%
She's going on about that.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:10%
We'll go to a break
and we'll be right back

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.832 align:middle line:10%
with James Van Praagh.

00:36:02.832 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I just want to say a
couple of things first.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting
that how spirits

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:10%
communicate very differently.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.770 align:middle line:10%
Like that last thing
with the Martini glasses,

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:10%
now she just showed me
glasses and drinking.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting that
that's how they communicate.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.770 align:middle line:10%
And also with the
death condition,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:18.770 align:middle line:10%
sometimes they don't want to
go back to the memory of that,

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:19.770 align:middle line:10%
so they won't reveal it.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.745 align:middle line:10%
So I just want to
share that with you.

00:36:21.745 --> 00:36:24.120 align:middle line:10%
>> And I want to share with
you that I knew that deceased

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:10%
person as well, and that was
very good and very accurate.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Talking to
Harry Dean Stanton.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:10%
Harry Dean was a friend of
Luana's, a friend of Bill

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.930 align:middle line:10%
Paxton, and a friend of mine.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:10%
We spent a few nights
playing guitar,

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:10%
hanging out at
Dan Tana's talking

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:10%
about life and the afterlife.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.650 align:middle line:10%
He was adamant there was
none, that life ends in death.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.500 align:middle line:10%
After making countless
movies, from "Cool Hand Luke"

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.550 align:middle line:10%
to "Pretty in Pink," Harry
passed away at age 91.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:10%
Here's a sampling
of his iconic roles.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:10%
>> And Guy phrased it to realize
you're nothing is wisdom,

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:10%
to realize you're everything
is love, or pure intelligence,

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:10%
pure awareness.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:10%
And that ultimately that
can be defined in words.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond words beyond.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.210 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond consciousness.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, it's nothing.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.462 align:middle line:90%
It's not important.

00:37:17.462 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say that
in a negative sense.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, it's not important.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:21.320 align:middle line:90%
It's all going to go.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a fucking
dream, man, all of it.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's not being
cynical, or nihilistic,

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.090 align:middle line:10%
or you can put all
kind of labels on it,

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:10%
but it's just what
is and period.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.280 align:middle line:90%
I was 14 years old, I think.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:90%
I was alone in my aunt's house.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And I got terrified all at once.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking there
was nothing out there.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.880 align:middle line:90%
It was oblivion.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I was terrified at 14,
or 13 or 14 years old.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.247 align:middle line:84%
I had to get on the
phone and call somebody.

00:37:54.247 --> 00:37:55.580 align:middle line:90%
I think that was the beginning--

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were you convinced
there was no-- why--

00:37:57.497 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:84%
why did you have this
panic that there was--

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:84%
why did you feel so
panicked by this emptiness?

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> There was no answer to it.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It just-- it just happened.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.170 align:middle line:10%
>> After Harry passed, I thought
it would be fun to interview

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.850 align:middle line:10%
him through Jennifer.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:10%
A week before his
memorial service,

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:10%
Jennifer and I
took up the topic.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Well let's ask--
because we can, let's

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:84%
ask Luana how her
friends who just

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:84%
showed up this past
week, Harry Dean.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh and don't forget
Hugh, he knew Hugh.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>> He named Hugh, OK.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's focus on Harry
Dean a little more because--

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I know about Harry Dean.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Let me find out.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:90%
He didn't accept it at first.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Which then, your
belief system--

00:38:45.635 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:84%
it's whatever you
believe is not wrong,

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.588 align:middle line:90%
it's just that's just the way.

00:38:48.588 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that
there's nothing--

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:84%
if you believe that
there's nothing that

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.740 align:middle line:90%
is going to be there, right?

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Then that's your belief.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:84%
He tried to quantify
it the best way he can.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.595 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is a
consciousness exaggeration.

00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:07.470 align:middle line:10%
There was something that
he tried to quantify

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.690 align:middle line:10%
or tried to quantify
what he was seeing

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:14.295 align:middle line:10%
and it was there with medicine
and the time that he was--

00:39:14.295 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:10%
the time that he was
leaving his body.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:10%
>> So he was assuming that
the medicine was creating

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:10%
hallucinations.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.710 align:middle line:10%
That's what he thought.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:25.970 align:middle line:10%
He was trying to document it.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Did he document things
or was he known for that?

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.010 align:middle line:10%
Like wanting proof
or did he study it?

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he was-- that
was his life was--

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:84%
is he was almost like a
philosopher in that way.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.860 align:middle line:84%
People who knew him and talked
to him, it was like very strong

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like a lot of
people around his bed.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if it was
etherically or his family.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It felt like he was very loved.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> He was very loved.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> So love, she said.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:90%
So loved.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.960 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when he crossed over,
she said he denied it at first

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:90%
or resisted at first?

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> He tried to understand it,
like he does with everything.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.640 align:middle line:90%
So he tried to--

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.140 align:middle line:84%
again, the word "quantify"
comes into mind.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> He tried to assume that
he was just like either stuck

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:90%
in his memory kind of thing.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.276 align:middle line:90%
>> And so who broke through?

00:40:23.276 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>> She did.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe that.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.940 align:middle line:90%
So how did she break through?

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:90%
What did you do, Lu?

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Held his hand.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Held his hand.

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:31.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Held this hand.

00:40:31.283 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Told him it was safe.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Told him he was safe.

00:40:34.805 --> 00:40:36.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Told him it was safe.

00:40:36.786 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:90%
It would be a soft landing.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Soft landing.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you and Harry Dean
went on a trip together.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they did to Santa
Barbara or somewhere fun?

00:40:46.016 --> 00:40:47.732 align:middle line:84%
>> They went north
on a road trip.

00:40:47.732 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what she showed me.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.195 align:middle line:10%
She showed me a car.

00:40:50.195 --> 00:40:51.820 align:middle line:10%
And she showed me
like a hat, like it's

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:10%
something with a convertible.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Convertible.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.277 align:middle line:90%
Be specific, please.

00:40:57.277 --> 00:40:58.110 align:middle line:90%
So convertible, hat.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And the care
meant everything.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> The car meant everything.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Whose car was it?

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:90%
Was it Harry's?

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.605 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it doesn't look--

00:41:04.605 --> 00:41:05.990 align:middle line:90%
he had part ownership.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It felt like it was a studio's
car, something like that.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.033 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:41:10.033 --> 00:41:11.700 align:middle line:10%
But there was another
person in the car.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to see him on Monday.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Was it her brother?

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:17.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Like a brother?

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Like a brother,
they grew up together.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:10%
I feel like they
went to high school,

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.315 align:middle line:10%
like they grew up together.

00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Career together.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Career together, same thing.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything you two want me
to tell Fred when I see him

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.740 align:middle line:90%
on Monday?

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Just hearts.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:84%
She just blew like
hearts and kisses.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Hearts and kisses.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.850 align:middle line:90%
That's not enough for Fred.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Tell Fred he's dehydrated.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.520 align:middle line:84%
There's something
with his headaches.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>> He has headaches.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>> He has headaches.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:90%
And he needs to hydrate more.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Drink more water.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:45.540 align:middle line:10%
That's very good.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.340 align:middle line:90%
That's something.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
got to Monterey,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.580 align:middle line:84%
there was something
going on, an event.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a festival
that was going on.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of a festival?

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.915 align:middle line:84%
>> She says free
spirit festival.

00:41:58.915 --> 00:41:59.715 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:59.715 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:10%
>> But the festival
that was going on--

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:10%
she's showing me movie screens,
so there was something that was

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:10%
going--they had to like sit.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:10%
And then she's showing
me screens that you

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.528 align:middle line:10%
take pictures in front of.

00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:90%
They had to be a part of.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.567 align:middle line:10%
And it had to do with
advertising, whatever it was.

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Were there people performing?

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.067 align:middle line:10%
>> They just did it for fun.

00:42:23.067 --> 00:42:24.994 align:middle line:10%
It felt like a--

00:42:24.994 --> 00:42:28.080 align:middle line:10%
in our day, like a
bunch of bands playing,

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.160 align:middle line:10%
like a reggae thing.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:29.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Something like that.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was like
the first of its kind.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.357 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the first,
like "Lollapalooza"

00:42:37.357 --> 00:42:39.270 align:middle line:10%
but way back then.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember any of
the acts that you saw perform

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I just got shown Prince,
but I don't think he was there.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.260 align:middle line:90%
So I-- can't imagine.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.505 align:middle line:90%
>> But somebody like Prince.

00:42:47.505 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Somebody as big as that.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody in that
kind of vein of Prince.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, like Michael.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.720 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I know but Prince
was a guy who played--

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Guitar.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:42:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> So was it Jimi Hendrix.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.617 align:middle line:84%
So she showed me Jimi
Hendrix and that's

00:43:03.617 --> 00:43:05.080 align:middle line:84%
where I got the
reggae part of it.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Now--

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> There is an afterlife.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there-- oh, is that
what you want me to tell Fred?

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Luana.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:11.570 align:middle line:90%
That's very--

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Fred knows it.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Fred was much more mature,
he says, than he was.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Can I put an exclamation
point in that?

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Go easy on him.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Remember the baby.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Remember the baby.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.200 align:middle line:84%
The girl who had
the baby that died?

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Or miscarried or
something along those lines.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:30.045 align:middle line:10%
That's OK.

00:43:30.045 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if I would
be able to reach her,

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.315 align:middle line:10%
because I don't know her.

00:43:33.315 --> 00:43:34.800 align:middle line:10%
>> He's showing me Google.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.538 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know if
there's something

00:43:35.538 --> 00:43:35.700 align:middle line:10%
that can be on the internet.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.130 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:10%
I'll look that up, Harry.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.450 align:middle line:10%
I'll do that.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:middle line:10%
Now there's a mutual
friend that we have.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.650 align:middle line:84%
If you look around this
room, there's another person

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:45.210 align:middle line:90%
that Harry Dean knows.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Well Bill Paxton, right?

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> See, well Bill showed up.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
make sure that was him.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.780 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.575 align:middle line:84%
And so now do you
know consciously

00:43:53.575 --> 00:43:54.450 align:middle line:90%
why they're together?

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:57.300 align:middle line:90%


00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Showing me like a
mentor or something.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:00.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> A mentor and I think
Bill was really young or one

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.340 align:middle line:90%
or the other was very young.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do something
when they were young.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> What was it like for Harry to
see Bill or Bill to see Harry?

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they had a drink.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.608 align:middle line:84%
They were just-- they
were like what the fuck,

00:44:18.608 --> 00:44:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Well the both of you-- the both
of you get the chance to sort

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.877 align:middle line:84%
>> But which part in "Titanic--"
he was part of "Titanic."

00:44:25.877 --> 00:44:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Because he showed me "Titanic."

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, Bill was
part of "Titanic."

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So Lu, talking to Harry,
Harry is there one thing

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.830 align:middle line:90%
he wants to let us know?

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:38.800 align:middle line:84%
There is an afterlife,
exclamation point.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.860 align:middle line:90%
There's more than an afterlife.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.418 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is an
afterlife comma,

00:44:45.418 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:90%
there's more than an afterlife.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a present life
that creates an afterlife.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean, Harry?

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Or is that Lu?

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> He's showing me
different levels.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.913 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah?

00:44:56.913 --> 00:44:58.580 align:middle line:10%
>> He said because
he didn't believe it,

00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.550 align:middle line:10%
he kept on spinning.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:10%
He wasted a lot of time here
mentally thinking about it,

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.697 align:middle line:10%
because he couldn't--
he couldn't escape it.

00:45:04.697 --> 00:45:06.780 align:middle line:10%
So he's like on the bottom
of the treadmill on it.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.620 align:middle line:84%
If you just believe,
then it will take you--

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:84%
why you're here, you're able to
be more present versus fighting

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.593 align:middle line:10%
>> You don't know who
Harry Dean is, do you?

00:45:15.593 --> 00:45:17.420 align:middle line:10%
>> I have no fucking
idea who he is.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.600 align:middle line:10%
I thought he was a sausage.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Sorry.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.200 align:middle line:10%
>> He's not Jimmy Dean.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.930 align:middle line:10%
But Bill knows who he is
and Luana knows who he is.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:24.815 align:middle line:10%
And Luana knows--

00:45:24.815 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Bill was very--

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.890 align:middle line:10%
Bill was just like
this to Harry.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Kimberly Babcock is a medium
and a minister from Ohio.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.680 align:middle line:10%
She was visiting Los
Angeles when I asked

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.790 align:middle line:10%
to meet her for the first time.

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:40.220 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, it was in
another noisy restaurant.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.290 align:middle line:84%
In the interview with
Kimberly Babcock,

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I asked if we could speak
to my old friend Bill who

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.620 align:middle line:90%
passed a few weeks prior.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I never say his full name.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.110 align:middle line:84%
She has no idea who he is,
but everything she says

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:51.950 align:middle line:90%
is accurate.

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:57.677 align:middle line:90%


00:45:57.677 --> 00:45:59.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Was he unable to say
goodbye before you passed?

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, must have been
quick or no closure.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.290 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.980 align:middle line:10%
I have-- I have closure.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.420 align:middle line:10%
I am at peace.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.090 align:middle line:10%
I am-- he knows that he
didn't get to say goodbye.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.810 align:middle line:10%
There's no closure.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:18.060 align:middle line:10%
Sounds like this they still have
that wound, because there was

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.830 align:middle line:10%
no closure before he passed.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.890 align:middle line:10%
Or he must not have been
able to say goodbye,

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.870 align:middle line:10%
like he keeps going like this,
which means didn't get to say

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.400 align:middle line:10%
goodbye before he passed.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill Paxton has died.

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Celebrities reacted quickly
to the loss on Twitter.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.060 align:middle line:10%
"Apollo 13" co-star Tom
Hanks sweetly wrote, "Bill

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.160 align:middle line:10%
was simply a wonderful man."

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.290 align:middle line:10%
>> There was room on
the door for Jack.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:44.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Bill was known for starring
in iconic blockbuster films

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.754 align:middle line:10%
including "Titanic," "Aliens,"
"Apollo 13," and "Twister."

00:46:49.754 --> 00:46:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What does he
look like to you?

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually don't
see him at all.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.250 align:middle line:84%
He just makes me do
that with my hand.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:56.655 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:56.655 --> 00:46:58.776 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sensation or
a presence about you?

00:46:58.776 --> 00:47:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.755 align:middle line:10%
Did he have heart issues, chest?

00:47:01.755 --> 00:47:02.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:02.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:04.910 align:middle line:10%
All the energy goes into
the heart and the chest

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:05.952 align:middle line:10%
to validate his presence.

00:47:05.952 --> 00:47:07.952 align:middle line:10%
And he makes me feel like
his passing was quick,

00:47:07.952 --> 00:47:09.750 align:middle line:10%
like he didn't get
to say goodbye,

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:13.150 align:middle line:10%
but he's at peace with
the quickness of it.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.650 align:middle line:10%
And I have closure with that.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:10%
And I want they--
them to have closure.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.152 align:middle line:10%
They need to have closure.

00:47:18.152 --> 00:47:20.402 align:middle line:10%
>> So really, the only way
we can give them closure is

00:47:20.402 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:10%
for you to tell them something--

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:22.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Who?

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.415 align:middle line:10%
>> --that they don't know the
answer to-- or we don't know

00:47:25.415 --> 00:47:26.215 align:middle line:10%
the answer.

00:47:26.215 --> 00:47:27.673 align:middle line:10%
Is there anything
you can tell them

00:47:27.673 --> 00:47:30.570 align:middle line:10%
that's new or more information?

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>> All I heard-- when you were
kind of talking was I'm sorry.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.610 align:middle line:10%
Would you know if
his dad was there,

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.140 align:middle line:10%
if his dad was
passed before he did?

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, he did.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Because I see dad
like written in the air.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.630 align:middle line:10%
So it's dad.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> In interviews with
two other mediums,

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer Shaffer and Raylene
Yuanez both said his father was

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:49.410 align:middle line:90%
there to greet him.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.510 align:middle line:10%
When we asked Bill if
that was a happy reunion,

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.660 align:middle line:10%
he said, yes and no, because
that meant one thing--

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.950 align:middle line:10%
I must have died if
I'm seeing my dad.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:57.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Interesting.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Billy, I just wanted
to tell you I want to leave this

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.650 align:middle line:10%
door open for you.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.260 align:middle line:10%
I knew I was
interviewing Kim today

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:07.890 align:middle line:10%
and I thought, well, this would
be a fun chance to just say hi.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can come to wherever
you need to, if you need to.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:17.100 align:middle line:10%
>> He says he feels like
he would be a smart aleck.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.600 align:middle line:10%
>> He would.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:10%
>> He says we always have
the chance to say hi.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.490 align:middle line:10%
You don't need her.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:23.948 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's saying.

00:48:23.948 --> 00:48:25.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no, I know that.

00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:26.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying--

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>> He's just smart aleck.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.150 align:middle line:10%
Did he smoke?

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:31.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.180 align:middle line:10%
>> He's got like a--

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:38.490 align:middle line:10%
it must be a cigar, because it
feels bigger than a cigarette.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:41.100 align:middle line:10%
He feels like he
knows no stranger,

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.880 align:middle line:10%
like that kind of person.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.563 align:middle line:10%
>> So what was the biggest thing
you've learned in passing over?

00:48:45.563 --> 00:48:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no time.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.590 align:middle line:10%
There is no death, he says.

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:57.957 align:middle line:10%
And he didn't realize how much
fear he had, until he died.

00:48:57.957 --> 00:48:59.040 align:middle line:10%
I'll just say it verbatim.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.465 align:middle line:10%
Like I'll speak as if I'm him.

00:49:00.465 --> 00:49:02.190 align:middle line:10%
He says, I'll say this.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.710 align:middle line:10%
I realize the fear that
I carried within myself

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:10%
planted fear in others.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.460 align:middle line:10%
And for that, I shed remorse.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.860 align:middle line:10%
Meaning I know and
acknowledge my remorse

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.708 align:middle line:10%
and I have to heal in that way.

00:49:15.708 --> 00:49:18.000 align:middle line:10%
Because he's showing like
the collateral damage he did.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.195 align:middle line:10%
So for example-- this is what
he's saying to give an example.

00:49:20.195 --> 00:49:22.680 align:middle line:10%
Like we walk around, like,
I'm so worried about my heart.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm so worried about--

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.770 align:middle line:10%
and other people think, oh
gosh, I should be worried, too.

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And so it created
collateral damage

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.100 align:middle line:10%
because we then
believe in our fears

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.800 align:middle line:10%
and it created this
collateral damage he said.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:10%
He didn't realize
how much he did that.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:10%
He's funny.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:40.320 align:middle line:10%
I liked his personality.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.060 align:middle line:10%
He's one of those
people that he's

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.392 align:middle line:10%
going to give you a little bit
just to make you want more.

00:49:46.392 --> 00:49:47.850 align:middle line:10%
When you said is
there anything you

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:52.200 align:middle line:10%
want me to tell your friends,
or family, or whatever,

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:10%
he literally said I can fly.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.940 align:middle line:10%
And he's playing like
(SINGING) I can fly, I can fly.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:58.740 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Great.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.810 align:middle line:10%
>> But he's laughing, because
it's almost like I know they

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.030 align:middle line:10%
want more but this is
what I'll give them--

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.630 align:middle line:10%
I can fly.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell
Kim your last name?

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Why?

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:15.810 align:middle line:10%
That's what he did.

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:17.118 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what he did.

00:50:17.118 --> 00:50:17.990 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.900 align:middle line:10%
I know he loves--

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I said are you sure?

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.650 align:middle line:10%
And he's like
checking his pockets--

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.150 align:middle line:10%
nope, he says.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:25.393 align:middle line:10%
>> Come on, Billy, come one.

00:50:25.393 --> 00:50:27.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Let me tell you the conscious
information that I know--

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:31.350 align:middle line:10%
is your name with an
'e' at the end of Towne.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:10%
And he just told me this today.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.925 align:middle line:10%
And then I also
know because he said

00:50:34.925 --> 00:50:37.050 align:middle line:10%
he worked with you that
you must be in the industry

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:38.130 align:middle line:10%
or you were in the industry.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:38.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Um-hmm.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.420 align:middle line:10%
>> And so that's what I do know.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.200 align:middle line:10%
I don't know anything else.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Should we'd say if our
friend Hira is available?

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.747 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know how
you're going to do that.

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:52.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, this is up to Jennifer.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.910 align:middle line:10%
Now Luana, Eddie,
you know who Hira is.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:58.710 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.090 align:middle line:10%
How do you spell Hira?

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.380 align:middle line:10%
>> H-I-R-A.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:10%
>> He wouldn't know that.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.500 align:middle line:10%
I have a picture of Hira.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.300 align:middle line:10%
You do?

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, that would be helpful.

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.015 align:middle line:10%
>> You have it handy?

00:51:08.015 --> 00:51:09.840 align:middle line:10%
>> That's how I look at cases.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Hira, I couldn't find Hira.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, Hira, where are you?

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I was looking for a person.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.105 align:middle line:90%
OK, give me a second.

00:51:18.105 --> 00:51:20.870 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Was there something wrong with
Hira's chest, that usually--

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> He had a heart attack.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:27.120 align:middle line:90%
So that's his chest area.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Luana is holding on to Hira.

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.653 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, Luana's--

00:51:30.653 --> 00:51:31.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Luana's holding onto her.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Luana's holding onto Hira.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>> >> Yeah.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:34.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Him.

00:51:34.802 --> 00:51:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>> She knew him.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I-- she's just
showing me playing with him.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.380 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So Lu, we want
to talk to Hira.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.920 align:middle line:90%
We want to ask him questions.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Hira's saying that you
have felt him when he--

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:90%
after he passed.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.330 align:middle line:90%
You felt like an energy.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was in
the bed or next to you.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever feel that
thinking it was him?

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:58.430 align:middle line:10%
That was him.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.310 align:middle line:10%
That was him.

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:02.450 align:middle line:10%
And so he's showing me like
you getting startled thinking

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.190 align:middle line:10%
that you felt that.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:07.220 align:middle line:10%
And he's showing
me that was him.

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:10%
Like he comes across
like a person,

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:10.490 align:middle line:10%
like somebody that you cherish.

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Was he-- there's
something about 12.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> He died at the age of 12.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> He did.

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:18.180 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, thank you
Hira, appreciate that.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.510 align:middle line:10%
>> He said, that but
when they show me 12,

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:25.070 align:middle line:10%
sometimes it means
December so I wasn't sure.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:27.360 align:middle line:10%
I felt like you
took him everywhere.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> You took him everywhere.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.060 align:middle line:84%
He says that you were the
best owner in the world.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:35.930 align:middle line:10%
Everybody wanted to
come back and be Hira.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:42.710 align:middle line:10%
Like you put him first more
than anything else or any human.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>> At that time in my
life, I certainly did.

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:49.170 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a good thing to ask.

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:51.710 align:middle line:10%
>> So when you're able
to, a Lotus position--

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:55.160 align:middle line:10%
they keep showing me you in
a Lotus position, just calm.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.758 align:middle line:10%
And then just use your heart.

00:52:56.758 --> 00:52:58.550 align:middle line:10%
That's where they're
saying open your heart

00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:59.610 align:middle line:10%
and just think of them.

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:10%
It's like a calling card.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:05.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Those are three of the most
important people in my life--

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.760 align:middle line:10%
Hira, Eddie, and Lulu.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Hira's being
well taken care of.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Since then Hira has helped
speak to other animals.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Hira reports, "Animals are
aware of how incarnation works

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.740 align:middle line:90%
but humans are not."

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Robert had been a
skeptic, but when

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.456 align:middle line:84%
asked his thoughts
since said, "Martinus--"

00:53:25.456 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:90%
his nickname for me--

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.682 align:middle line:90%
"when you know, you know."

00:53:30.682 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Part Three--

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:37.550 align:middle line:10%
Hacking the Afterlife via
Accessing Near Death Events.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:41.180 align:middle line:10%
>> An incredible installment in
our series She's Got Faith with

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.570 align:middle line:10%
the question what
happens when we die?

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Stephanie Arnold says she
knows the answer, because she

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.850 align:middle line:90%
was dead for 37 seconds.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.700 align:middle line:84%
She flatlined while giving
birth to her second child.

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And a glimpse of what
happens after death

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:58.142 align:middle line:90%
forever changed her life.

00:53:58.142 --> 00:54:00.350 align:middle line:10%
>> And the thing was is that
I had had a baby before.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.580 align:middle line:10%
I'd had a c-section before.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.840 align:middle line:10%
So it wasn't the
fear of the unknown.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.700 align:middle line:10%
So I told everybody, I said
not only am I going to die.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to need
a hysterectomy.

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:10.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to hemorrhage.

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:11.910 align:middle line:10%
These organs are
going to combine.

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:13.785 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be put
under general anesthesia.

00:54:13.785 --> 00:54:15.020 align:middle line:10%
The baby's going to be fine.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.020 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to be dead
on the operating table.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.490 align:middle line:10%
So I saw who hit the
button for the code.

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:22.160 align:middle line:10%
I saw that my anesthesiologist
was down by my feet.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:27.050 align:middle line:10%
I saw the nurse that jumped
on my chest to give me CPR.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:30.020 align:middle line:10%
I saw what was happening down
the hall with my other child

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.490 align:middle line:10%
in the labor and delivery room.

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:33.410 align:middle line:10%
My husband wasn't
present at the time,

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:37.430 align:middle line:10%
but I saw what he was wearing
when he got off the plane.

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:40.340 align:middle line:10%
I had heard my doctor say
over and over again this

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.360 align:middle line:10%
can't be happening,
this can't be happening.

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.600 align:middle line:10%
And I said to her later,
I said, did you say that?

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.210 align:middle line:10%
And she said I did,
but in my head.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you seeing yourself
translucent or are you just

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:52.490 align:middle line:90%
seeing the energetic visual?

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Like is it just light or is
it actually you and light

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:57.480 align:middle line:90%
or a combination of the two?

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You know I don't see
as much of the torso.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't see feet.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I see more of like
from waist up.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I see a dress,
like just a long dress.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.853 align:middle line:10%
So I can't tell where their--

00:55:10.853 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:10%
>> What color is that dress?

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all white.

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Can we bring Steph's guide here?

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:19.940 align:middle line:90%
It might be you, Ida.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But could we bring
her guide here?

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it a male, or a
female, neither, or both?

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:27.550 align:middle line:90%
What comes to mind?

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Or a light?

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Male.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> A male.

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not--

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sorry, say
again-- male what?

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not-- it's not her.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:35.830 align:middle line:90%
She's not my guide.

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Sam, I'm going to ask
you to do us a huge favor.

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Would you walk our friend
Steph in to visit her council.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We're standing outside,
walking on a path.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a door
in the distance,

00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:02.550 align:middle line:84%
but it's a sidewalk
path, like an arch.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And is there a building
in the distance?

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.347 align:middle line:90%
The door-- attached to the door?

00:56:07.347 --> 00:56:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The door is attached
to a building, yeah.

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.263 align:middle line:90%
>> What does it look like?

00:56:10.263 --> 00:56:11.610 align:middle line:10%
Is it white, black, green?

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:14.520 align:middle line:10%
>> It's white-- it's
white, but a little gray.

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.320 align:middle line:90%
But there's no markings on it.

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it
look like inside?

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.715 align:middle line:90%
What does it looked like?

00:56:20.715 --> 00:56:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it feels like
the room is wide open.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>> David Bennett is a former
science officer who drowned

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.700 align:middle line:90%
for 12 minutes.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.998 align:middle line:10%
His NDE was studied
by scientists

00:56:31.998 --> 00:56:33.540 align:middle line:10%
at the University
of Virginia and was

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.535 align:middle line:10%
featured in Morgan
Freeman's "Story of God."

00:56:35.535 --> 00:56:38.070 align:middle line:10%


00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Just about then this falling
bridge above our heads and it

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.660 align:middle line:10%
just came crashing
down on top of us.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And it folded the Zodiac in half
like a peanut butter sandwich.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was catapulted
into the sea.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:56.100 align:middle line:10%
And I'm hanging on to this
old World War II Mae West life

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.020 align:middle line:10%
jacket.

00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.430 align:middle line:10%
You know the big orange pillows?

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:00.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'm hanging
on to that just--

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.730 align:middle line:10%
and I'm a commercial diver.

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:09.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm trained as a commercial
diver, so I'm not freaking out.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm used to being in the water.

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:13.920 align:middle line:10%
I've logged thousands
of hours underwater.

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I'm just
holding my breath.

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.950 align:middle line:10%
And I have faith
that this life vest

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:23.010 align:middle line:10%
is going to bring me up to
the surface sometime soon.

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:27.625 align:middle line:10%
You reach a point where the
oxygen deprivation creates

00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:29.310 align:middle line:10%
a euphoria.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:33.960 align:middle line:90%
And you believe you can breathe.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And you just breathe
in saltwater.

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
pleasant experience.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:39.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's a burning.

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And it happens very quickly.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.250 align:middle line:10%
And then, boom, you're gone.

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.693 align:middle line:10%


00:57:45.693 --> 00:57:47.610 align:middle line:10%
There's something in the
brain that allows you

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:53.070 align:middle line:10%
to escape that severe agony.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:55.350 align:middle line:10%
Then I saw this light appear.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.830 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't-- it was
just off in the distance.

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was drawn to it, just
absolutely drawn to it.

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:05.127 align:middle line:10%
And I felt like I
was moving toward it.

00:58:05.127 --> 00:58:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But I can't tell if it
was coming toward me,

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.877 align:middle line:90%
I was going toward it.

00:58:07.877 --> 00:58:10.020 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like
movement to me.

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a tunnel
or anything like that.

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:13.720 align:middle line:90%
It was just light.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And as I got closer, and
closer, and closer, it grew.

00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:21.540 align:middle line:10%
It grew and, you know,
and it was infinite.

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.430 align:middle line:10%
And as I got closer,
it looked like millions

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:26.130 align:middle line:10%
upon millions of
fragments of light.

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:30.210 align:middle line:10%
And they were all moving,
and dancing, and coalescing

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:32.160 align:middle line:10%
together and stuff like that.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything in nature
that would fit the description?

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, yeah, have you ever
seen a school of like sardines

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:41.280 align:middle line:84%
or anchovies, how
they work together?

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when
they're near the surface,

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.860 align:middle line:84%
they'll move in
unison to the light.

00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And they'll refract the light
multiple colors and things

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.180 align:middle line:90%
like that just, you know?

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's kind of like what
the fragments appeared to me.

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:58.140 align:middle line:84%
They were of a like
mind moving in unison

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and coming together, and
separating, and coming

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:02.880 align:middle line:90%
together, and doing--

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.020 align:middle line:90%
it was beautiful.

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was in awe.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.060 align:middle line:10%
I was in absolute gaga
awe of this light.

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:10.970 align:middle line:10%
And I-- and I kept--

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:12.830 align:middle line:10%
I was coming closer and closer.

00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>> It's kind of stacked.

00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:14.630 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:17.340 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to the-- let's
go to the first row

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.260 align:middle line:10%
of that stacked group.

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.570 align:middle line:84%
How many people are
in the first row?

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Six.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Six.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:27.780 align:middle line:90%
How are they arrayed?

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Are they in a line?

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Are they sitting or standing?

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Are they in a circle,
a semicircle, or what?

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.950 align:middle line:10%
>> They're in a line.

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:36.750 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:39.880 align:middle line:10%
Priscilla, thank you for
allowing us to chat with you.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.010 align:middle line:10%
We appreciate it.

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:46.050 align:middle line:10%
First question of the day,
how is our friend Steph doing?

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.587 align:middle line:10%
>> She's going to be fine.

00:59:47.587 --> 00:59:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> She's going to be fine.

00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little different
than what our pal Sam said,

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:52.740 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.225 align:middle line:90%
Or what Ida said, struggling.

00:59:54.225 --> 00:59:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So Priscilla, would you
put that in our friend's mind?

00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:01.830 align:middle line:84%
That not only is she doing OK,
but she's doing pretty good,

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.280 align:middle line:90%
isn't she?

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.120 align:middle line:10%
>> She's on the path
she's supposed to be on.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.780 align:middle line:10%
Am I-- correct me if I'm wrong.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, she is.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way Priscilla,
have you heard of me?

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> How so and put
that in Steph's mind?

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, through a dog.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm the annoying guy who
goes around and ask questions.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.070 align:middle line:10%
So through a dog.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
I love that!

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:29.190 align:middle line:10%
So which dog?

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:30.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I see like--

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:33.990 align:middle line:10%
it looks like a German
shepherd, but it's--

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:37.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh my gosh, is it is
it through my dog, Sam?

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:39.160 align:middle line:10%
How do you know Sam, Priscilla?

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:39.960 align:middle line:10%
Or do you?

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know.

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.500 align:middle line:10%
>> But don't judge it.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I don't--

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:46.900 align:middle line:10%
I just see her playing
fetch with him.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.700 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.180 align:middle line:10%
Very good.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:48.980 align:middle line:10%
Let's not judge it.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.950 align:middle line:10%
That's hilarious.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:50.520 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.353 align:middle line:10%
Priscilla, let me ask
you a direct question.

01:00:52.353 --> 01:00:57.280 align:middle line:10%
Is this my dog Sam or is this
some other German shepherd?

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
>> That's how we know each
other is through the dog.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.080 align:middle line:10%
Great.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.180 align:middle line:10%
And is it my dog though?

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.460 align:middle line:10%
The dog that I know is Sam?

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.360 align:middle line:10%
OK, very good.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe it is.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.520 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.090 align:middle line:10%
Well she can tell you
no, or maybe, or yes.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.360 align:middle line:10%
What does she say?

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.250 align:middle line:10%
Thumbs up.

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> She's smiling.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.082 align:middle line:90%


01:01:16.082 --> 01:01:18.767 align:middle line:10%
>> She's saying that you
don't want to believe,

01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:19.600 align:middle line:10%
but I'm telling you.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I totally--

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.450 align:middle line:10%
I totally-- I talked to
Sam for the first time

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:23.660 align:middle line:10%
about a month ago.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.570 align:middle line:10%
So I totally get
what she's saying.

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>> And then three fragments
broke away and they came.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.700 align:middle line:10%
And they--

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Three out of--

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Infinite.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Out of infinite.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Billions and trillions.

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:42.945 align:middle line:84%
And they came toward me and
they conveyed this welcome home.

01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And one thing I
forgot to say was

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.030 align:middle line:10%
as I was getting
closer to this light,

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.520 align:middle line:10%
I just kept feeling
these waves of love

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.235 align:middle line:10%
that felt like it was embracing
me in this warm blanket.

01:01:51.235 --> 01:01:57.580 align:middle line:90%


01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:02.260 align:middle line:10%
And I was so comfortable
with this love.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:08.950 align:middle line:10%
Just it just was such a warm
embrace that when these three--

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.680 align:middle line:10%
and I talk to them
as light beings,

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.750 align:middle line:10%
because they were
fragments of light

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:17.380 align:middle line:10%
that were heading toward
me and welcoming me home.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.330 align:middle line:10%
And it's still
tough to talk about.

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:21.100 align:middle line:10%
It's been over 30
years and I'm still

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:26.170 align:middle line:10%
getting choked up because
it was a feeling of home

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:28.900 align:middle line:10%
like I've never,
ever felt before.

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Here's an example of
hacking the afterlife by asking

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.830 align:middle line:10%
questions about a vivid dream.

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:35.170 align:middle line:10%
I was invited by Susan
Pinsky to her podcast

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:38.440 align:middle line:10%
where I suggested an experiment
with her husband Dr. Drew.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.650 align:middle line:10%
And so you mentioned
earlier that there was a--

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.640 align:middle line:10%
I think it was a
disconcerting memory?

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:48.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I had what I thought
was a horrible dream when I was

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:50.170 align:middle line:10%
very young, like under
two, under three.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.790 align:middle line:10%
He had where your irises
are and your pupils,

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:53.980 align:middle line:10%
he had red crosses.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:54.940 align:middle line:10%
Very cool.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:55.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.396 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

01:02:56.396 --> 01:02:57.196 align:middle line:10%
>> Ooh, right?

01:02:57.196 --> 01:02:58.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In life or in this memory?

01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:59.450 align:middle line:10%
>> In this memory.

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:03.850 align:middle line:10%
I really don't-- I'm just free
associating as you suggested.

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:04.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Whose home is this?

01:03:04.873 --> 01:03:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this the Burgermeister's?

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.380 align:middle line:10%
Do me a favor Burgermeister,
put into Drew's mind

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.550 align:middle line:10%
your last name.

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:14.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Schmitz.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:15.440 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, thank you.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.760 align:middle line:10%
And what year?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Just pop a year--

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> 1900?

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Literally 1900 or 1890 or--

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right in right there.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Whoever is
Drew's spirit guide,

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
join this little crowd that
we're talking to here--

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:30.960 align:middle line:90%
the light.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a-- thank you.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So can I ask this
light to come forward

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.450 align:middle line:90%
or you get closer to it?

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And then eventually about
a dozen of these fragments

01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
of lights were
there greeting me.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And we started to-- there was
no conveyance of come on, let's

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.040 align:middle line:90%
go, we got to do something.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It was more of just
an understanding

01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:51.260 align:middle line:90%
we've got to go over here.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And we went to this
area that was very--

01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:56.690 align:middle line:10%
to me it felt spherical.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:04:00.260 align:middle line:10%
And we started to
reexperience my life.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.480 align:middle line:10%
And we experienced
it in such a way,

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.300 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't just me
experiencing it.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.890 align:middle line:10%
They were experiencing
it as well.

01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:08.180 align:middle line:10%
And they were very excited.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.020 align:middle line:10%
>> All 12?

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.070 align:middle line:10%
>> All 12.

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:13.100 align:middle line:10%
We were all
experiencing my life.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.900 align:middle line:10%
And not just from
my point of view,

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.810 align:middle line:10%
but from every
interaction I'd ever

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:22.820 align:middle line:10%
had from the people that
I'd interacted with.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I got to see my interactions
and how I hurt other people

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:27.930 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:31.370 align:middle line:84%
But I also got to see that
when I did open up, and I did

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
have experiences of just being
open-hearted and giving freely

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of my love and my
heart how that created

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.690 align:middle line:90%
some of the biggest ripples.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:43.880 align:middle line:10%
The things that I
took so much pride in,

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:49.840 align:middle line:10%
like becoming the chief engineer
of Aloha and things like that,

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.760 align:middle line:10%
didn't have such big ripples.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.800 align:middle line:10%
What really had
the bigger ripples

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.710 align:middle line:10%
was when I would help someone
without any look for reward

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:57.680 align:middle line:10%
or anything.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.970 align:middle line:10%
And I got to really experience
it in this life review

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:05.050 align:middle line:10%
and see how that planted
a seed in my being

01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:08.920 align:middle line:10%
that when we do
things for each other,

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.210 align:middle line:10%
that we're expanding
our connections.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We're expanding that positive
energy, that sort of thing,

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.930 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:20.380 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know that
through most of my life,

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.750 align:middle line:10%
because I had a lot of
suffering and stuff,

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:26.050 align:middle line:10%
until I experienced this
where I did it myself,

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.840 align:middle line:10%
of my own free will,
open-hearted without any look

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.700 align:middle line:10%
for reward or
anything like that.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I got to experience
this woman's joy.

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:35.620 align:middle line:10%
Well I had one of those--

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.600 align:middle line:10%
I call it deja vu on steroids--

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.170 align:middle line:10%
type of moments
where I experienced

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.200 align:middle line:10%
part of that future life
review in the hospital when

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.620 align:middle line:10%
the doctor came in and was
telling me you've got cancer.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:50.170 align:middle line:10%
Only he didn't use the C word.

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.620 align:middle line:10%
You have tumors that have
done this, and this, and this.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.180 align:middle line:10%
And so they were
explaining it to me.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.610 align:middle line:10%
When he was doing
it, it was like I

01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:59.692 align:middle line:10%
knew before he
walked in the door

01:05:59.692 --> 01:06:01.150 align:middle line:10%
this-- because I'd
never met this--

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:03.940 align:middle line:10%
he was an intern at the
hospital that I never knew.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.020 align:middle line:10%
He came in.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.630 align:middle line:10%
And I recognized
him immediately.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.610 align:middle line:10%
And I recognized
the surroundings,

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:10.540 align:middle line:10%
everything around me.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And I knew exactly what
he was going to say.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.960 align:middle line:10%
And I sat there.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.030 align:middle line:10%
I let him squirm a
little bit, because he

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:21.820 align:middle line:10%
was-- because I was an assistant
director there at the hospital.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.520 align:middle line:10%
So I mean I was well
known and stuff.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And here's this new intern about
to give me the death sentence,

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.000 align:middle line:10%
And he's hemming and hawing.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.150 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sitting there thinking,
I remember this moment

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.470 align:middle line:10%
from my life review.

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:37.930 align:middle line:10%
And I know exactly
what he's going to say.

01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:41.560 align:middle line:10%
And I know I'm going to regret
it in my next life review,

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.834 align:middle line:10%
but I'm going to let
him squirm a little bit.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.850 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Because it
really didn't bother me

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:48.100 align:middle line:10%
that he was going to say that.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.780 align:middle line:10%
Because I saw that I was
going to have cancer,

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.660 align:middle line:10%
but, like you said, I also saw
I was going to live beyond it.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.470 align:middle line:10%
So there was a certainty
that this was just

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:57.800 align:middle line:10%
a part of that purpose.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.460 align:middle line:10%
And this was something
that I had to experience.

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:04.000 align:middle line:10%
I had to go through the cancer
so that I could experience

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.600 align:middle line:10%
the suffering, so I could
experience the pain, so that I

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.850 align:middle line:10%
could experience all of that.

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:11.272 align:middle line:10%


01:07:11.272 --> 01:07:12.730 align:middle line:10%
And they told me
they weren't going

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:14.090 align:middle line:10%
to treat it, all that stuff.

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:15.880 align:middle line:10%
And I said, no, we are going
to treat it, because I'm

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.797 align:middle line:10%
going to survive this.

01:07:16.797 --> 01:07:18.630 align:middle line:10%
And they all
immediately thought--

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:22.810 align:middle line:10%
you know Elizabeth
Kubler Ross, and--

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:25.360 align:middle line:10%
they all thought I was in
denial, the first stage

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.740 align:middle line:10%
of grief, right?

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.170 align:middle line:10%
But I had already gone
right to acceptance,

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.990 align:middle line:10%
because I accepted that, yeah,
this is just a stage, something

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:33.370 align:middle line:10%
that I have to go through.

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:37.750 align:middle line:10%
This is one of my challenges,
one of my purposes in life.

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.670 align:middle line:10%
And that if I
follow my guidance,

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:41.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to survive
this without a doubt.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.040 align:middle line:10%
And so I was very certain
right from day one.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.070 align:middle line:10%
Everybody else in my life
was certain I was dying,

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:51.310 align:middle line:10%
but I was certain I was living
and this was an opportunity

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.190 align:middle line:10%
to live life and experience
life and to squeeze

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:56.350 align:middle line:10%
all the juice out of life.

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Now do me a favor.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And this energy that's right
in front of you, put your hand

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
inside of it-- your
imaginary hand,

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
just slip it right
into this energy.

01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:06.700 align:middle line:90%
What does that feel like?

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:07.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Peace.

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, very good.

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:09.450 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:10.430 align:middle line:10%
Warmth and peace.

01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:11.230 align:middle line:10%
All right.

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:15.370 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to ask this
light, if the light could

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:19.390 align:middle line:10%
transform into an entity so
that we can have a conversation.

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.550 align:middle line:10%
Male or female?

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:22.350 align:middle line:10%
>> I guess male?

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>> I want you to take
Drew by the hand.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:27.060 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to walk
him into his council.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:27.937 align:middle line:10%
>> Council?

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Drew does not know what
I'm talking about, but, Mort,

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:31.560 align:middle line:10%
you know what I'm talking about.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:31.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Huh.

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:34.770 align:middle line:10%
>> So would you do me a favor,
walk him towards his council.

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:37.020 align:middle line:10%
Are we inside or outside?

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Are we in a room, are we ou--

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>> In a room.

01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>> We're in a room.

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, very good.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And now are they--
how are they arrayed?

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.632 align:middle line:84%
How many people are
there in this room?

01:08:45.632 --> 01:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't really tell.

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:47.465 align:middle line:10%
>> But roughly from--

01:08:47.465 --> 01:08:48.265 align:middle line:10%
>> 12.

01:08:48.265 --> 01:08:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.908 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm having trouble
seeing individuals.

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:51.708 align:middle line:90%
>> That's OK.

01:08:51.708 --> 01:08:53.380 align:middle line:10%
Are they-- just what's
your impression?

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Impression like Native
Americans are here.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:55.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Very good.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.939 align:middle line:10%
Are they all male?

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:57.930 align:middle line:10%
Are they female?

01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:58.870 align:middle line:10%
Are they a combo?

01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:59.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Mix.

01:08:59.670 --> 01:08:59.880 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.390 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to the--

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:01.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Mostly male.

01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:03.450 align:middle line:10%
>> --first person
on the far left.

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:07.050 align:middle line:90%
What's this person look like?

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a female pilgrim.

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
go up close to her.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.569 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:14.236 align:middle line:84%
>> She's one of the
only women in there.

01:09:14.236 --> 01:09:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's give her a name.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's ask--

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Marie.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Marie, thank you.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.059 align:middle line:90%
And how is she dressed?

01:09:19.059 --> 01:09:19.859 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS].

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:20.729 align:middle line:90%
Like a--

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:21.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a pilgrim?

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:22.369 align:middle line:90%
Brown.

01:09:22.369 --> 01:09:23.639 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying what colors.

01:09:23.639 --> 01:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Like dark with a white apron
and with those bonnets that

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:28.590 align:middle line:90%
they would--

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.150 align:middle line:90%
And Marie--

01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I love this.

01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Marie is her name.

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:34.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Something like that.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:35.029 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Marie, I want you to
put into Drew's mind

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.910 align:middle line:84%
how you earned your
position on the council.

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.479 align:middle line:90%
>> She brings history.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:43.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.229 align:middle line:90%
History.

01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:45.029 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And Hence the pilgrim
outfit, we like that's.

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:47.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very clever.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And now I want you to describe
the emotion or the feeling

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.810 align:middle line:84%
you're getting from
holding this person's hand.

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Kindness.

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Kindness.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:56.970 align:middle line:90%
What kind of kindness?

01:09:56.970 --> 01:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a simple word, is
it is it overwhelming kindness.

01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:06.760 align:middle line:90%
It's gentle, wise, deliberative.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me ask Marie, how do
you feel what we're doing?

01:10:09.785 --> 01:10:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Do you think this is weird?

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>> She-- everyone thinks
it's weird in this room.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] I appreciate that.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And outside.

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:15.567 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't think--

01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's weird.

01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.707 align:middle line:84%
She's-- we're talking
about the council.

01:10:18.707 --> 01:10:20.398 align:middle line:90%
They think it's weird.

01:10:20.398 --> 01:10:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm hypnotized, myself.

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Marie, I want you to ask--

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I want you to say
something to Drew.

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I want you to give
him a sentence--

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:29.737 align:middle line:90%
and to the people listening in--

01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:30.820 align:middle line:90%
I want you to give him a--

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Wisdom is wealth.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.187 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is wealth.

01:10:35.187 --> 01:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Drew, is this something
you've heard before?

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you.

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So Marie, this is
coming from Marie.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I would call this
new information.

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's move to the
next person to Marie.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Is it a male or a female?

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm having trouble because
I have this presence of like

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.460 align:middle line:10%
a North American Indian.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And that feels-- it feels like--

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't judge it.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm feeling--

01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm judging it.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Please don't.

01:10:58.290 --> 01:10:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm judging it.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, so very good.

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>> So describe
what he's wearing.

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:01.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Headdress.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.730 align:middle line:10%
>> How many feathers?

01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:04.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Lots.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>> How many?

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.840 align:middle line:90%
10?

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> 90?

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Are they up?

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:08.350 align:middle line:10%
Are they down?

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:09.558 align:middle line:90%
>> All the way down his back.

01:11:09.558 --> 01:11:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Up and then down his back.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Up and then down.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.020 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to look
carefully at his face.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:14.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Look at those eyes.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the emotion
you get looking at him?

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Depth, depth.

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Depth?

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:21.720 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.510 align:middle line:10%
Is he wearing any symbols,
or emblems, or jewelry?

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Beads.

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Beads.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This one is like
making me emotional.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.300 align:middle line:90%
This guy.

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Very good.

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.350 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why I'm having
trouble staying with his eyes.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's OK.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Just look at his
beads for a second.

01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Just focus on those beads.

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:43.780 align:middle line:10%
And please, if he can give
us a name or the tribe

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.370 align:middle line:10%
that he represents?

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Humanity.

01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Humanity.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a tribe that's
called itself "humanity?"

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.790 align:middle line:90%
There is.

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:51.550 align:middle line:10%
Well the Sioux
considered everybody

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:54.160 align:middle line:10%
in their tribe to be
"humanity" and everybody

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.560 align:middle line:10%
who was not in the Sioux
was not "humanity."

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.880 align:middle line:10%
Let me ask him directly.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.743 align:middle line:10%
Are you Sioux?

01:11:58.743 --> 01:12:00.160 align:middle line:10%
Could I characterize
you as Sioux?

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.090 align:middle line:10%
>> You could
characterize it that way?

01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:01.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:05.050 align:middle line:10%
Are you Lakota, or
Dakota, or Nakota?

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:05.900 align:middle line:10%
Which one.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Nakota.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:10.900 align:middle line:10%
>> You have been watching over
him for so many lifetimes.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:14.340 align:middle line:10%
Do you feel like he's
doing a good job?

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> He will.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> He will.

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And would you show him why
he's doing the kind of work

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
he's doing where he's saving
lives on a daily basis?

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> He's waving a spear over me.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:26.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And is that spear a
warrior spear or is--

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.185 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more-- more ceremonial.

01:12:34.185 --> 01:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a blessing,
some power being transmitted

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
or something.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Well what does that feel like?

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It's all very confusing.

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Is he transmitting it to you?

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a feeling of it?

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
What is that feeling
that he's trying

01:12:49.410 --> 01:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
to impart from you with his
great knowledge of humanity?

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Patience and work to be done.

01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Drew remains a skeptic.

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:01.920 align:middle line:10%
After this experiment, he
said he felt hypnotized.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.720 align:middle line:10%
He asked, how else
could I be seeing

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.340 align:middle line:10%
people I've never seen before?

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.730 align:middle line:10%
I pointed out his answers were
identical to dozens of others.

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:10.420 align:middle line:10%
Josh Davidow is a filmmaker.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We met in Tibet while I was
filming "Journey into Tibet"

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:14.420 align:middle line:90%
with Robert Thurman.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Here's my consciousness.

01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And then and I was just
kind of like where am I?

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.020 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.603 align:middle line:84%
What's the story, because I was
so used to hearing that voice.

01:13:21.603 --> 01:13:22.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:13:22.403 --> 01:13:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And then I looked down.

01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
the next thing I saw.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:30.630 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing I saw was the
landscape and the amazing scape

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:32.550 align:middle line:10%
up at the top from there.

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.700 align:middle line:10%
But then I looked
down and saw my body.

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I immediately
remember thinking

01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
is seeing your dead
body and immediately

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
going into habituated thought
of going, Jesus, that's bad.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But the second I
did that, there was

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:48.950 align:middle line:84%
another part of
me that went, hang

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:52.400 align:middle line:90%
on a minute, that's not bad.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not anything, it just is.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.440 align:middle line:90%
That's your body.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm still me.

01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And I hear my voice.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm cracking
wise in my head,

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:02.990 align:middle line:90%
but I don't have that body.

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:04.930 align:middle line:90%
What else don't I have?

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I start going
through this checklist.

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have guilt.
And I don't have shame.

01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have pain.

01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have history.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
all of these things

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:22.658 align:middle line:84%
that I really owned
as a physical body.

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go visit your council.

01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Are we inside or outside?

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> We're inside.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.405 align:middle line:90%
Describe it to me.

01:14:29.405 --> 01:14:30.280 align:middle line:90%
What's the structure?

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like a--

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
sort of like a court room but
a built out of white pearl.

01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>> How many people
are in the room?

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
When you look around, how
many counselors are here?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Six.

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Six.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.255 align:middle line:90%
All right, very good?

01:14:45.255 --> 01:14:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And are they in a row or
are they in a semicircle?

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> They're in a semicircle.

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Semicircle.

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the first
person on the left.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.060 align:middle line:90%
He kind of seems alien.

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.530 align:middle line:84%
He's got like three
sort of fingers.

01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like a claw,
but it's very benign looking.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
They're normal-size eyes,
but they're all pupil.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.340 align:middle line:90%
They're all black.

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look like clothes.

01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It looks like-- it looks
like the same skin that's

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
on his hand, which
is like a putty.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What's one word that you
could use to represent how you

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.410 align:middle line:90%
earned a spot on Josh's council?

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
What's a word that you represent
in Josh's spiritual evolvement?

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> He said discipline.

01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you normally incarnated
on a planet in our universe

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:35.790 align:middle line:90%
or in another universe?

01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Another universe.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Another universe.

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody in
Josh's life who has

01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:43.890 align:middle line:90%
had lifetimes on your planet?

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> He says yes.

01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Has Josh had a
lifetime on your planet?

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I want you to put that
lifetime in Josh's mind.

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Are we inside or outside?

01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Inside.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>> You're inside.

01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:56.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Are we in a building, or a
structure, or where are we?

It seems like a very
mechanical-- it almost

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.513 align:middle line:90%
looks like a fertility clinic.

01:16:07.513 --> 01:16:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost looks like--

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%

one, but you have.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%

Very good.

>> Actually, I haven't.

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> What is this place, Sith?

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Is this a fertility clinic?

01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Is this where Josh works
or what's he doing there?

01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, first, let me ask you--

01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:24.550 align:middle line:90%
we're inside.

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:26.485 align:middle line:84%
What does Josh look
like in this lifetime?

01:16:26.485 --> 01:16:28.610 align:middle line:84%
If you could just show it
to him without any stress

01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:30.200 align:middle line:90%
or weirdness.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he kind
of looks like Sith.

01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Josh's role on this
planet, is it science?

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it some kind of a doctor?

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It is some kind of a doctor.

01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
fertility, doesn't it?

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.708 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

01:16:44.708 --> 01:16:47.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Something to do with it,
because that's what you put

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:47.920 align:middle line:10%
in his mind.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So some kind of
a doctor involving--

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
are you guys having a difficulty
with fertility on your planet?

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just the process.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just the proce--
yeah, it's making--

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.470 align:middle line:90%
it's designing a good future.

01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're telling me he's
not consciously aware of having

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
an event where some aliens came
and talked to him or something

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.100 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>> No, he's not.

01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're showing
it to him now.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> How does the information get
passed from Josh to you guys?

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it etherically,
electrically, energetically?

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean how is the information
that you're seeking happen?

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We experience it.

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
We experience it
while he sleeps.

01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:29.747 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you
come by, and it's

01:17:29.747 --> 01:17:31.420 align:middle line:90%
like you scan him in a way.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And you get the information.

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And that information, what's
the value of that information

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.300 align:middle line:90%
for your folks back home?

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> To make better people.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And by making better people,
you're not talking about

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.610 align:middle line:90%
making--

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:45.193 align:middle line:84%
do you mean-- you
talking about making

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.760 align:middle line:90%
better people on your planet?

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.775 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean?

01:17:48.775 --> 01:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Making better
people on Earth.

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You're helping and--

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.300 align:middle line:90%
correct me if I'm wrong, Sith--

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:56.380 align:middle line:84%
you're helping alter the
consciousness of the planet.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct.

01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%

are you familiar with what

01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing asking councils
and councilors information

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.980 align:middle line:90%
about their charges?

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:08.972 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you guys
think about this?

01:18:08.972 --> 01:18:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Is this unusual for you?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> They think you're
on the right path.

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What word do you
represent on Josh's council?

01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:17.660 align:middle line:90%

>> Did he earn that from
having a difficult lifetime?

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> He earned it.

01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Does Josh want to
see where he earned it,

01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:26.580 align:middle line:90%
or is that stressful?

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>> No, he can see if he wants.

01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:29.210 align:middle line:90%

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:30.260 align:middle line:90%

>> We're inside a
cockpit of a plane.

OK.

01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:16.270 align:middle line:10%
A different plane,

a man stopped him and
said, Oh, I know you,

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:43.690 align:middle line:10%
you're on television.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Wait, come over to my table.

01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And he had like seven
daughters with him.

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And the person, this megastar,
went over to the table,

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and very politely shook his
hand, signed an autograph,

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.820 align:middle line:90%
kissed a couple of the girls.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know
who that star was?

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It was you.

01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:59.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:21:59.317 --> 01:22:01.150 align:middle line:10%
>> It was right after
Chuck was on the show.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Right after we did
the friendly show.

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And we know what you
were like before the--

01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:04.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Even you.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I did that at
Musso and Franks?

01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:06.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Musso and Frank's.

01:22:06.965 --> 01:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But see, he came on and told
me that whole friendly stuff

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:13.460 align:middle line:84%
for 90 minutes here, about,
oh, you've got to be friendly.

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But I've been that
way all my life.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It's infectious.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, so I
got bored with him.

01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are you leaning
so close to my friend.

01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:23.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I like Richard
better than I like you.

01:22:23.543 --> 01:22:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It really happened.

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:24.970 align:middle line:90%
That's I mean.

01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead, continue.

01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>> He's got an aura about him.

01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:29.920 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful guy.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You were making
everybody laugh--

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> --about meeting someone.

01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I did.

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I made everybody laugh
about meeting, you Merv.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the punch
line, because I met you.

01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:44.440 align:middle line:90%
I was at Musso and Frank's.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.660 align:middle line:90%
I saw you signing autographs.

01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, look at that,

01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Merv will go stop at
any table and sign

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:51.880 align:middle line:90%
autographs for anybody.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean he's really a polite guy.

01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:54.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So Merv, why all
the shows, buddy?

01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> He could recognize talent
even when they couldn't.

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the guy that
passed away that you did--

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that was in your movie
that did the naked--

01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:08.110 align:middle line:90%
naked dating.

01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Howard Schultz.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Howard Schultz.

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:14.002 align:middle line:84%
>> So what kind of things
are you working on or talking

01:23:14.002 --> 01:23:14.802 align:middle line:90%
about?

01:23:14.802 --> 01:23:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Are they story points?

01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Like you grow up in Wisconsin
and I'll grow up in Iowa,

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and we'll meet up
somewhere along the path?

01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So like that,
like story beats.

01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody advise you on the
story beats or you guys just

01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:31.060 align:middle line:90%
work it out yourselves?

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> They're laughing.

01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:37.323 align:middle line:84%
They have hundreds-- like
there's like thousands

01:23:37.323 --> 01:23:38.240 align:middle line:90%
of people behind them.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands of people who
have to-- do they have to agree

01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:41.960 align:middle line:90%
on the process?

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware that
there's free will.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.290 align:middle line:90%
So people can say--

01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Merv, are you doing this with
a lot of people or is Howard

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:49.490 align:middle line:90%
just one of the people.

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> They both want it.

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:55.140 align:middle line:84%
They both think that they're
more powerful together.

01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:58.655 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of topics are
you guys going to work on.

01:23:58.655 --> 01:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> They're going to do
shows that have humor,

01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:02.310 align:middle line:84%
because they think
that's great medicine.

01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So almost like build
a network together.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:11.240 align:middle line:90%
So Merv, we'll be right back.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That's
what he used to say.

01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I would like to speak to--

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
if it's possible-- can we
speak to her main council,

01:24:19.670 --> 01:24:21.410 align:middle line:84%
the main council
of the people who

01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
advise Kimberly
in her lifetimes?

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> She says, yes, and she pushes
through like it's the feeling

01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.930 align:middle line:90%
of four, like four.

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Four.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Very good, thank you.

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so going from left to
right, if you could describe

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.587 align:middle line:90%
the first person on your left.

01:24:34.587 --> 01:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING] Go figure.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, if there was ever a being
that looks like ET, I'm like,

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.200 align:middle line:84%
of course, it's you because
I've seen this one before,

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.880 align:middle line:90%
only one time before.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we speak to
you, sir, ma'am?

01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:52.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he told me his name.

01:24:52.623 --> 01:24:53.540 align:middle line:90%
His name is Sebastian.

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
He has like gray
skin, no raised ears.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.470 align:middle line:90%
He looks like an ET.

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> But he's got two arms.

01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But just a little out
of proportion to human.

01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And his eyes are big or small.

01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> They're big, but
his face is very flat.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So like how we have
the difference in space

01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:21.310 align:middle line:84%
from our nose to here dips
down, he doesn't have that.

01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And Sebastian, can Kimberly
take a hold of your hand

01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and hold your hand for a second?

01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:28.990 align:middle line:90%
What does that feel like?

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:31.640 align:middle line:84%
What's the emotion you get
from that emotional feeling?

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Safe.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Definitely emotional
and definitely safe,

01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
very, very, very, very safe.

01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Safe.

01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:37.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.450 align:middle line:90%
That was kind of--

01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Comforted and loved.

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Sebastian, define love.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.800 align:middle line:90%
She's feeling love from you.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.180 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.730 align:middle line:90%


01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> He shows me the
word everything.

01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> That idea that
love is everything.

01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Are you referring
to consciousness

01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and how consciousness
is in everything

01:25:58.290 --> 01:25:59.680 align:middle line:90%
and that consciousness is love?

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm just curious.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.690 align:middle line:90%


01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:10.250 align:middle line:84%
He's showing everything and
the plan of everything is love.

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing
like this spiral.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:19.330 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like a stretched
out slinky from space to Earth,

01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:24.700 align:middle line:84%
like the cosmos to
Earth, where everything

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.650 align:middle line:90%
is the translation of love.

01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And the harmony that it
projects, and creates,

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and shares is the
level of like--

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.040 align:middle line:90%
what is this word--

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.520 align:middle line:90%
integration--

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> --of love.

01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Kimberly ever incarnated
on your planet or where you

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.290 align:middle line:90%
normally have incarnated?

01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>> He says, yes.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.340 align:middle line:90%
She is now.

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you could allow her--
can we see that for a second?

01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Where is this planet that
you normally incarnate, is

01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:00.380 align:middle line:84%
it in our universe or is
it in another universe?

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not in our universe.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
get down to or Cygnus

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.720 align:middle line:90%
5, or Pleiades, or something.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you going to
show Kimberly just

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.490 align:middle line:84%
for a glimpse, what does
it look like on the surface

01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:16.535 align:middle line:84%
of that planet where
she is concurrently.

01:27:16.535 --> 01:27:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.750 align:middle line:84%
She has a lifetime
concurrently to this one.

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And without getting
into the mass,

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.570 align:middle line:84%
just show her what
does it look like.

01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm literally like
standing here looking down.

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.182 align:middle line:90%
And it's like--

01:27:30.182 --> 01:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Rich, do you remember
the movie "Avatar?"

01:27:31.890 --> 01:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And do you know
how there's pieces

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
of Earth-like
objects almost kind

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.722 align:middle line:84%
of floating around
with each other?

01:27:38.722 --> 01:27:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind
of like from one--

01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:44.200 align:middle line:84%
it's similar to that, but
it's like I'm looking down.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:50.350 align:middle line:84%
But when I look down, I
can see like cosmos below.

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But I also have an understanding
of like over here to the right,

01:27:55.060 --> 01:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
it looks green and lush,
but it's also not solid.

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:00.940 align:middle line:90%
It's--

01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost like a
mental construct?

01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And you created it,
almost mathematical?

01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:28:07.810 --> 01:28:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Is he wearing anything
jewelry wise or is he just--

01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you're just seeing
skin, this gray skin?

01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Just skin.

01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And he's cold and kind
of clammy to the touch.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not jewelry,
it's like his skin.

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost like how a tree
has rings for how old it is.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Sebastian, are those rings
around your neck related to age

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:31.930 align:middle line:90%
or what are they related to?

01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Evolutionary he says.

01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Evolutionary.

01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And just to give our listeners
an idea of how old you

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.310 align:middle line:90%
are in Earth years.

01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah. his energy like shifts.

01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And he gets-- he's so intense.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.320 align:middle line:90%
And his voice got really deep.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.260 align:middle line:90%
And he said eons, like eons.

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if these
rings represent lifetimes

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
as much as they represent like
epiphany that caused expansion.

01:28:58.710 --> 01:28:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that make sense?

01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Epiphany that
cause expansion.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Like consciousness adjustments,
like judging time over the fact

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that you've adjusted
consciousness.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.230 align:middle line:90%
So you're an important dude.

01:29:12.230 --> 01:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Sebastian, how many
councils do you work on?

01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you just work
with Kimberly or do

01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:18.590 align:middle line:90%
you work with many people?

01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Many.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.980 align:middle line:90%
So the person to his left--

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:24.950 align:middle line:84%
this is interesting, because
I've never seen her before,

01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:25.820 align:middle line:90%
her face.

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> She has dark hair.

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:32.490 align:middle line:84%
She looks like a
Native American Indian.

01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> May I ask-- may I ask you.

01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I forgot to ask Sebastian.

01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of this work I'm
doing, talking to councils?

01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time, he says.

01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you.

01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your what's
your opinion of it?

01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> He's doing this.

01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It means thank
you in sign language.

01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's what
he was just telling me.

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Like he was literally saying
that when you said that.

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you--

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:56.010 align:middle line:10%
>> --like in sign language.

01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, mind blown.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Mind blowing.

01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:29:58.790 --> 01:30:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So this woman, let's ask her
for a name, if you don't mind.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I cannot believe
I'm hearing this like.

01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:07.600 align:middle line:90%
She's almost, like, why?

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Why would you be mind blown?

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Awashonks?

01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Awashonks.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Awashonks.

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Awashonks, thank you.

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> This is so crazy.

01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:24.380 align:middle line:90%
She's very fierce in her energy.

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:26.600 align:middle line:84%
She's very direct
and very fierce.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So may I ask you some
direct questions, Miss A?

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you represent
in Kimberly's journey,

01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:36.890 align:middle line:90%
just as a word or a concept?

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:40.490 align:middle line:90%


01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Whatever that means.

01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Alignment maybe?

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Focus.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.240 align:middle line:10%
Have you lived a lifetime
on the planet Earth?

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.552 align:middle line:10%
So you have and this is--

01:30:48.552 --> 01:30:51.010 align:middle line:10%
>> And then I'm sure you can
imagine what she's showing me.

01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:54.950 align:middle line:10%
She's saying I'm
not afraid to kill

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:57.870 align:middle line:10%
to get to where I need to be.

01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes
to kill, it's not

01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:02.360 align:middle line:90%
like she's on a mission to kill.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's more
of like prioritizing,

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:10.940 align:middle line:84%
like letting things die to
prioritize what needs to live.

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you familiar with
this work that I'm doing

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.050 align:middle line:90%
talking to councils?

01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> She says, I am.

01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And then she follows that
up with I am a part of it.

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, very good.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me ask you about that.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Did you put Kimberly
and me together today?

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happened?

01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> She takes full-- like she
takes big responsibility.

01:31:30.230 --> 01:31:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Like she sits back
and gets really big

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.367 align:middle line:84%
and has this energy of
taking responsibility.

01:31:35.367 --> 01:31:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you like to
tell people that are listening

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
in, or hearing this for the
first time, or accessing this?

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
What would you
like as a message?

01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Simultaneous transaction.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:51.020 align:middle line:84%
She's saying talk to
the land and also let

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.280 align:middle line:90%
the land talk to you.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.228 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like a plea,
like let the land talk to you.

01:31:57.228 --> 01:31:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like you
won't lose your way.

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.800 align:middle line:90%
She's showing like clarity.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.210 align:middle line:90%
You won't lose your way.

01:32:02.210 --> 01:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I get it, but I
don't know who his is.

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.655 align:middle line:90%
He's like that Microsoft guy.

01:32:05.655 --> 01:32:06.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

01:32:06.455 --> 01:32:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct?

01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:07.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.133 align:middle line:84%
>> He's showing me,
but I didn't get it.

01:32:09.133 --> 01:32:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I don't
get things, it's--

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all right.

01:32:10.730 --> 01:32:11.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't know his name.

01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:13.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell you his name.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.420 align:middle line:10%
First name is Paul.

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.173 align:middle line:10%
>> Paul.

01:32:17.173 --> 01:32:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul.

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I know you're talking
about his name.

01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:22.580 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:24.100 align:middle line:10%
Let me just tell you, it's OK.

01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:27.050 align:middle line:10%
>> He owned a football team, a
basketball team or a football

01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.320 align:middle line:10%
team?

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Very good.

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.810 align:middle line:10%
He did.

01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:29.926 align:middle line:10%
He owned both.

01:32:29.926 --> 01:32:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Both.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So who was there to greet
you when you crossed over?

01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:40.460 align:middle line:90%


01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:43.170 align:middle line:10%
>> I just got a big
football player.

01:32:43.170 --> 01:32:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Really, interesting.

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Let me just go with it.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Just go with it?

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> White or Black?

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Black, African-American.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>> African-American.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.634 align:middle line:10%
Somebody we might know?

01:32:54.634 --> 01:32:56.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Kind of like Polynesian.

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.840 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I'm seeing Black,
but it might be Polynesian.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.880 align:middle line:90%


01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:07.010 align:middle line:10%
I feel that he didn't play for
him, but he tried to help him.

01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:08.690 align:middle line:10%
He wanted him to
play, but he died

01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:10.970 align:middle line:10%
before he could play for him.

01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul wanted to help him.

01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But he passed
away before he--

01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Before he could help him.

01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Did he went to help
him with his illness?

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.610 align:middle line:10%
Did he have a brain problem?

01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:20.831 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what it feels
like, but I don't know

01:33:20.831 --> 01:33:21.780 align:middle line:10%
if it's concussions.

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.580 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.465 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, that's what it is.

01:33:23.465 --> 01:33:24.390 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:25.525 align:middle line:10%
That would be what it was.

01:33:25.525 --> 01:33:26.900 align:middle line:10%
Now that you're
on the flipside--

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>> He was who started,
it feels like.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Speak up.

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.160 align:middle line:10%
>> This guy was the start of it.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:32.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, very good.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:36.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Like he was the one that--

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:36.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Inspired him--

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.430 align:middle line:10%
>> He was so
heartbroken over it.

01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:39.230 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:39.570 align:middle line:10%
Was it--

01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:41.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Here he owns a sports
team and he feels like

01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:42.170 align:middle line:10%
they're hurt--

01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:42.420 align:middle line:10%
like

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:43.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:44.510 align:middle line:10%
I understand.

01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:45.760 align:middle line:10%
They're hurting good athletes.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.260 align:middle line:10%
>> He's trying to create
helmets that were even stronger.

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's focus on the
Archangel Raphael for a second,

01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:53.610 align:middle line:90%
if we can.

01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Can we?

01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

01:33:56.150 --> 01:33:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of angels and
speaking to angels or speaking

01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to people who
self-identify as angels.

01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:04.700 align:middle line:10%
I've often heard that
it's really in reference

01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:08.690 align:middle line:10%
to the ability to move
at the speed of thought,

01:34:08.690 --> 01:34:10.400 align:middle line:10%
that they're so fast.

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of wings
is more of a metaphor

01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:16.100 align:middle line:84%
than it is like, oh, I'm stuck
with these things on my back.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a metaphor for how--

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.130 align:middle line:90%
so is that accurate, Raphael.

01:34:22.130 --> 01:34:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And that makes sense as to
why he's saying and showing--

01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Propulsion.

01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --propulsion.

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Moving from realm to realm.

01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I've also heard the
term "guardian."

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he was showing--
do you remember when we were

01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:40.720 align:middle line:84%
talking to Sebastian, the ET
that was showing those rings

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.770 align:middle line:90%
almost like in his aura.

01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:46.910 align:middle line:90%
So Raphael's referencing that.

01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
When we were talking about
propulsion, like having those--

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:53.090 align:middle line:84%
so think about it like this,
just to try to put context to.

01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Think about those rings of
like evolution or awakened

01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:03.780 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, like a
quantum leap of growth.

01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's an imprint that's
there that's always accessible.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:10.552 align:middle line:84%
So that's why-- so it's
like they're the same.

01:35:10.552 --> 01:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like he's trying
to say that they're

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:18.690 align:middle line:84%
the same because an
archangel has those also.

01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the fast
propulsion, like the capacity

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.020 align:middle line:90%
to switch change quickly.

01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Because those are like
access points, he's saying.

01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Those rings are like access
points to the whole reality.

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Whatever access
point he's at, he

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.140 align:middle line:84%
has access to the
whole realm of it,

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:44.450 align:middle line:84%
like anything happening
on that channel.

01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, OK.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.270 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:48.560 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty big.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a portal almost.

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of us understanding
what an archangel is,

01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:56.210 align:middle line:84%
certainly since humanity
has been around,

01:35:56.210 --> 01:36:00.350 align:middle line:84%
or for a long time, people
have identified archangels like

01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:04.010 align:middle line:84%
seven of them or a
certain particular number.

01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Is that accurate or are there
many, many more than seven?

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> He's saying many,
many, many more.

01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If I refer to the Archangel
Michael, do you think, oh,

01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:17.630 align:middle line:84%
that's my buddy
Michael or is that--

01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:20.120 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Not like you do in your
frame of reference, he says.

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
When you say "Archangel
Michael," for him,

01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:35.340 align:middle line:84%
he connects more to a cause,
like cause and effect.

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like I see
literally like a shift.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:41.010 align:middle line:84%
When I say how do you
connect to Michael,

01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I see a shift and then awareness
in like compassion, heart,

01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:49.290 align:middle line:90%
protection.

01:36:49.290 --> 01:36:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the cause, is
it's a shift into that.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm like so--

01:36:57.690 --> 01:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why he keeps
repeating the word "exodus."

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.187 align:middle line:84%
It is so fascinating
because that's

01:37:03.187 --> 01:37:05.520 align:middle line:84%
sort of how he was answering
your question when you were

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.620 align:middle line:84%
saying, when I mention
"Michael," how do you connect

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:11.970 align:middle line:90%
to your buddy Michael?

01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:15.600 align:middle line:90%
He's saying like "exodus."

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
exodus is the bridge

01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:18.990 align:middle line:90%
to get to compassion.

01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Because like we
would say "Michael."

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.140 align:middle line:90%
We would use a name identity.

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.530 align:middle line:84%
But they use like
an intent identity.

01:37:25.530 --> 01:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it a vibrational
identity or intent?

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Like intent.

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But exodus would be movement
from one place to the next.

01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
That's what he's
showing, like a shift.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a shift.

01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So all right, here's a
question people on the planet

01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.890 align:middle line:90%
might want to know.

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Are we going through
an exodus right now?

01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:47.600 align:middle line:90%


01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> He's like you
better believe it.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHING] Is it
a speeded up exodus,

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:58.400 align:middle line:84%
or is people's awareness
becoming part of that exodus,

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.830 align:middle line:84%
or is it just something
that's happening?

01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean are we responsible
for it or are you

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.750 align:middle line:90%
guys responsible for it?

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Collective, mutual.

01:38:07.530 --> 01:38:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mutual.

01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's saying it's like
the effect of slowing it down

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:18.780 align:middle line:90%
speeds it up.

01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like in order to manifest
the construct of anything that

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:27.180 align:middle line:84%
serves, you have to
remove what doesn't serve.

01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
that holy destruction.

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:33.287 align:middle line:84%
And so keeping it
sacred and seeing it--

01:38:33.287 --> 01:38:35.370 align:middle line:84%
because if you keep it
sacred, you don't judge it.

01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:37.890 align:middle line:90%


01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Maintaining spaciousness
is vital for survival,

01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.900 align:middle line:90%
he's saying.

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Because you have--

01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Maintain spaciousness,
did you say?

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Maintain spaciousness?

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he's saying
it's like it's vital.

01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:52.920 align:middle line:90%
It's vital for survival.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it's like
eating yourself sick.

01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:59.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like eating so much
food, you have no more space

01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to put the food, but you just
keep eating until you die.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
space to put the food,

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:08.600 align:middle line:84%
if you don't maintain
spaciousness,

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.460 align:middle line:84%
we're just constantly
taking in, taking in.

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not
expanding, if we're not

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.290 align:middle line:84%
present to what we're taking
in, we're not expanding,

01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:16.730 align:middle line:90%
we don't have spaciousness.

01:39:16.730 --> 01:39:18.240 align:middle line:90%
We're not recycling.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your opinion
of what we're doing here?

01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> In what--

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of chatting with
you on the flipside and showing

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.310 align:middle line:84%
people that you can chat to
your guides, and teachers,

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and council members
any time they want to.

01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Is that a good thing?

01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Yes, like there's such a push
behind-- when you say, "Is that

01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.850 align:middle line:90%
a good thing?"

01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:40.210 align:middle line:84%
There's such a push behind
like punctuate the yes as

01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:41.350 align:middle line:90%
big as you can.

01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's expressing.

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:44.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that
in itself is the--

01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:50.380 align:middle line:84%
he says that in itself is
the display of spaciousness.

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen how all those
diseases can affect people

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and felt that.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.410 align:middle line:10%
So to be able to
do anything that

01:39:56.410 --> 01:40:00.730 align:middle line:10%
accelerates a treatment
of diseases like that

01:40:00.730 --> 01:40:02.350 align:middle line:10%
would be a fantastic thing.

01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:05.500 align:middle line:10%
This next research is trying
to fundamentally understand

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:06.850 align:middle line:10%
how the brain works.

01:40:06.850 --> 01:40:10.720 align:middle line:10%
And if you understood how
the brain worked better,

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:14.050 align:middle line:10%
that would help you treat
different kinds of personality

01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:17.810 align:middle line:10%
disorder, all sorts of different
other diseases associated

01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:18.610 align:middle line:10%
with the brain.

01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When Paul Allen passed, we
asked who was there to greet

01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:22.290 align:middle line:90%
him--

01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Dave Duerson and Junior Seau.

01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:25.600 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to thank him
for his Brain Institute.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I reached out to Junior's
widow as an experiment

01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to see if Jennifer could
connect to her husband Junior

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:34.100 align:middle line:84%
without knowing
she was his widow.

01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> He was, like, I almost
made it to the finish line.

01:40:38.210 --> 01:40:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:40:39.010 --> 01:40:42.220 align:middle line:10%
He said he went and saw people
privately, like doctors,

01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.810 align:middle line:10%
or did he go see
people for his mind?

01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:50.050 align:middle line:10%
I just felt like whatever
he was taking made it worse.

01:40:50.050 --> 01:40:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:54.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of Ambien.

01:40:54.622 --> 01:40:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Lots of Ambien.

01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> He covered everything.

01:40:58.190 --> 01:40:59.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Junior would you show--

01:40:59.585 --> 01:41:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> He had people
covering things.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Junior, would you show
Jennifer how you showed up

01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:08.475 align:middle line:10%
in our research,
if you don't mind.

01:41:08.475 --> 01:41:09.850 align:middle line:10%
And it has to do
with your brain.

01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:15.620 align:middle line:90%


01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Show me again?

01:41:17.174 --> 01:41:23.580 align:middle line:90%


01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wrestling--
or not wrestling.

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.280 align:middle line:90%
The-- what was it called?

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.150 align:middle line:90%
He just showed me the guy that--

01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:35.790 align:middle line:84%
not Microsoft, but
what was it, right?

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:36.780 align:middle line:10%
He showed me that guy.

01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.840 align:middle line:10%
And he showed me like their
research that they were doing.

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:40.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Because they know that--

01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:43.590 align:middle line:10%
for concussions.

01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And that that's what
caused all of this.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.118 align:middle line:10%
And that everything because
I'm looking for stuff--

01:41:48.118 --> 01:41:49.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm looking fucking everywhere.

01:41:49.410 --> 01:41:50.910 align:middle line:90%
And he's like just relax.

01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:52.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a control freak.

01:41:52.890 --> 01:41:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody-- the Microsoft
guy-- we were talking to him.

01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
to him about who

01:41:57.930 --> 01:41:59.630 align:middle line:90%
greeted him on the other side.

01:41:59.630 --> 01:42:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was him!

01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:01.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it was him.

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:02.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh my god.

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:04.710 align:middle line:10%
Oh my god.

01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Dave Duerson and Junior Seau
came by three times to insist

01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:11.970 align:middle line:84%
we tell people that Joe Namath
has cured his CTE by using

01:42:11.970 --> 01:42:13.950 align:middle line:90%
hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Hacking the afterlife
as a methodology

01:42:16.050 --> 01:42:19.350 align:middle line:84%
may one day help find cures
for illness or climate change

01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:21.280 align:middle line:84%
from those no longer
on the planet.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It's worth exploring
the possibility.

01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Number nine.

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready, number
10, eyes open, wide awake.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.736 align:middle line:90%
Wide awake now.

01:42:32.736 --> 01:42:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Number 10, wide awake.

01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:37.625 align:middle line:10%
>> So when are you guys
you going to start,

01:42:37.625 --> 01:42:39.250 align:middle line:10%
because I've got to
turn the camera on.

01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Very funny.

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:44.010 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
most interesting thing

01:42:44.010 --> 01:42:47.250 align:middle line:84%
was the inability
to speak at times.

01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I could tell it was difficult
to shake off what it actually

01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:55.690 align:middle line:90%
did to the soul.

01:42:55.690 --> 01:42:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

01:42:56.490 --> 01:42:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Like it's like--

01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The quote you said was
"It actually burned my soul."

01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I said it.

01:43:02.490 --> 01:43:03.290 align:middle line:90%
That's how it felt.

01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It literally felt like--

01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:05.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Like it scorched.

01:43:05.523 --> 01:43:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, yeah, literally
like I had burned inside.

01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Howard passed away
on New Year's Eve 2014.

01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:14.940 align:middle line:84%
He was sitting on
the beach in Hawaii

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:18.660 align:middle line:84%
at dawn reflecting on his 61
years of a life well lived.

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:21.000 align:middle line:84%
He's come often to speak
through Jennifer Shaffer.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.850 align:middle line:84%
She said at his memorial,
he was there, Rich, standing

01:43:23.850 --> 01:43:26.040 align:middle line:90%
behind you enjoying the show.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was interesting
when that just happened,

01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:33.030 align:middle line:84%
when I saw Prince, then I saw a
picture of Prince and somebody

01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:35.190 align:middle line:90%
took it off of a clipboard.

01:43:35.190 --> 01:43:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was your buddy
Schultz, Howard.

01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Howard.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.573 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's about his wife--

01:43:40.573 --> 01:43:41.890 align:middle line:90%
hold on.

01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Were you married?

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:44.520 align:middle line:90%
20 years.

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So Howard, can we
ask you some questions?

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Can we ask you some questions
about what's going on?

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:51.983 align:middle line:84%
What is it like for you
to communicate with us?

01:43:51.983 --> 01:43:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Like Jennifer and I are
sitting here in her office--

01:43:54.150 --> 01:43:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Fun.

01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:56.730 align:middle line:90%
He says fun.

01:43:56.730 --> 01:44:00.150 align:middle line:84%
He's showing me that
it is a vibration.

01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:03.570 align:middle line:10%
It's like everybody comes in
certain colors, vibrations,

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:04.710 align:middle line:10%
you name it.

01:44:04.710 --> 01:44:06.010 align:middle line:10%
It's all frequencies.

01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:06.810 align:middle line:10%
>> All frequencies.

01:44:06.810 --> 01:44:08.928 align:middle line:10%
>> So everything vibrates
at a different level,

01:44:08.928 --> 01:44:10.470 align:middle line:10%
whether it's the
ocean and mountains.

01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
take that frequency

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and create your own space.

01:44:14.170 --> 01:44:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So where do you
hang out, Howard?

01:44:16.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Have you created a home?

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Maui.

01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> In Maui.

01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:21.300 align:middle line:90%
So it feels like Maui?

01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I said Maui.

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.910 align:middle line:90%
He just showed me playing golf.

01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>> But how much of the
course do you create?

01:44:26.050 --> 01:44:28.653 align:middle line:84%
Do you create just one
hole or what's in your view

01:44:28.653 --> 01:44:29.570 align:middle line:90%
or do you create all--

01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> He collaborates.

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:33.510 align:middle line:10%
He creates an awareness
with the frequency.

01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:37.950 align:middle line:10%
That if people love
that, they'll come in.

01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:39.640 align:middle line:10%
>> What's your handicap?

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> 70?

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS].

01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

01:44:43.770 --> 01:44:44.700 align:middle line:90%
The most I know--

01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>> If I'm getting this right--

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:47.850 align:middle line:90%
again, it's interpretation.

01:44:47.850 --> 01:44:49.090 align:middle line:10%
But he's shown me a grid.

01:44:49.090 --> 01:44:52.860 align:middle line:10%
So if you had a 3D model
of what you wanted,

01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:57.660 align:middle line:10%
he's creating something
that is so spectacular

01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.460 align:middle line:10%
so other people come.

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.990 align:middle line:10%
Like he's able to do it.

01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:middle line:10%
He's getting information
from everyone.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.960 align:middle line:10%
He's taking information
from all of the golf courses

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.020 align:middle line:10%
and building his own
with help from people

01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.460 align:middle line:10%
that know how to build.

01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:15.780 align:middle line:10%
>> So Howard, so is there
anybody that we mutually know

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:18.210 align:middle line:10%
that you hang out with
or anybody you want me--

01:45:18.210 --> 01:45:19.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Luana.

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:19.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Luana?

01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:20.580 align:middle line:10%
OK, very good.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever meet Luana?

01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> But you know her there.

01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Tell me--

01:45:26.110 --> 01:45:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because
they both visit you.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well she was a Buddhist who
had trained in the Japanese

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:37.190 align:middle line:84%
school of Buddhism,
SGI, it's called--

01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.640 align:middle line:90%
So she's very focused on that.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Best thing, she said.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.200 align:middle line:90%
The best thing she ever did.

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.390 align:middle line:90%
It saved her life, I'm sure.

01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:45.930 align:middle line:90%
She told me that a few times.

01:45:45.930 --> 01:45:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And meaning you.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And what?

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Meeting you.

01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:50.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, and meeting me.

01:45:50.097 --> 01:45:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thanks, Lu.

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:51.922 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

01:45:51.922 --> 01:45:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> She just threw you a bone.

01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> A real bone.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Literally, threw me a bone.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's good.

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.350 align:middle line:90%


01:45:59.350 --> 01:46:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> He's a smart aleck.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.630 align:middle line:90%
He's like razzing you.

01:46:01.630 --> 01:46:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>> What does he say?

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>> He says-- he's like
what are you talking about?

01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.230 align:middle line:10%
We go way back.

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:12.010 align:middle line:10%
Like when you talk about
aren't you impressed?

01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:13.370 align:middle line:10%
Like what are you talking about?

01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:14.260 align:middle line:10%
We go way back.

01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:16.967 align:middle line:10%
And it's kind of
like where are you?

01:46:16.967 --> 01:46:19.300 align:middle line:10%
But he's just kind of like
beating you up, you know how?

01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I know.

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.760 align:middle line:10%
That was our relationship.

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:23.830 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, you're looking
at us sitting here

01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:30.040 align:middle line:10%
in Hugo's Restaurant in West
Hollywood, what do you see?

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:31.941 align:middle line:10%
>> Like it's about time.

01:46:31.941 --> 01:46:34.066 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you've been
hesitant to talk to him

01:46:34.066 --> 01:46:36.790 align:middle line:10%
