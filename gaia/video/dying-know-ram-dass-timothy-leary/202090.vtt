00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the taboo.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.345 align:middle line:84%
It's the taboo,
basically of all time.

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, of all time.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.137 align:middle line:84%
>> And right now, there
are a few more taboos.

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We knocked off the
taboo against sex.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:90%

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.036 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:28.836 align:middle line:90%

>> [LAUGHS]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Drugs, of course.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember how upset
society got about drugs.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It still is.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> The war on drugs?

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
We certainly know
about that taboo.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:90%
The next thing was death.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has deep
thoughts about death.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:90%
The ultimate taboo.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> They blew up in this
world, this psychedelic world.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it ended the 1950s.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It was all up for grabs.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to describe
what that felt like.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Leary and Alpert will be
remembered as cultural icons

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.470 align:middle line:84%
of the '60s especially, and very
influential people in not only

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
American culture,
but world culture.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> They are iconic figures
who stepped off the map.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.777 align:middle line:90%
They really paid heavily.

00:01:11.777 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The use of psychedelic drugs,
such as marijuana, mescaline,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and LSD is out of control
in the United States today.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I knew he was an outlaw.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:10%
>> And you have to be quite
a bad-ass to get locked up

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:10%
for your ideas.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We had a deep,
deep friendship.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.257 align:middle line:90%
But we also had a deep enmity.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> We're all going to die.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Why not learn how to do it with
class and style and friendship

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:84%
as the climactic
expression of a life.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>> What Ram Dass did for our
culture was to open up a door

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:10%
of spirituality by having
surrendered so completely

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:10%
to love.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> When you walked in, there
was a flash of total joy.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, me too.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And love.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.123 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
the words are, but--

00:02:17.123 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:10%
>> See, in my mythology now,
I'd say you and I are connected

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:10%
at a place where we both
danced through this incarnation

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:10%
together, but that we have a
connection that is timeless

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:10%
in another sense of that.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:10%
And we're all beings that
know each other well,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.697 align:middle line:10%
through many forms.

>> I think one
incarnation is wonderful.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I started out a
Jewish boy from Boston,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:10%
from psychology,
to psychedelics,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:10%
to Eastern mysticism.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:10%
And then to have
ended up Ram Dass,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:10%
just getting straight
on until it was gone.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are you?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a very difficult question.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Throughout my life,
I was infatuated

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:90%
by where the action was.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I never wanted to have
power, but I wanted to--

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I ran for governor once
against Ronald Reagan.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to experience the
different theaters, or stages,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.222 align:middle line:10%
or viewpoints of life.

00:03:40.222 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I think I lived one of the most
interesting lives of anyone

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th century.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> In the summer of 1995,
Timothy Leary announced

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
to the world media that he'd
been diagnosed with inoperable

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:90%
prostate cancer.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:90%
He was dying.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:10%
>> It's shocking that people
are not expected to talk about

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.645 align:middle line:10%
their dying or to plan it.

00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:15.945 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly the
greatest adventure

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and celebration of your life.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
It should be the
process of moving on.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> He turned it into
a theater piece.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:10%
He turned it into a poem.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:10%
He turned it into a dance.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's just what he did
with all the rest of his life.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a celebratory moment.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.792 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Living's a team sport.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.325 align:middle line:90%
Dying's a team sport.

00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Be open to new ideas.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Remember when people used to say
that LSD is an escapist drug?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.345 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a confrontation.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing-- LSD is dangerous,
because you can't escape--

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:90%
you've got 100 billion neurons.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And my thing about death
is not escaping it.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm running toward Miss Death.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't turn this
over to the doctors.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.228 align:middle line:84%
You can't turn it
over to the priests.

00:05:04.228 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
You can't turn it over to
the medical profession.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Think for yourselves.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
No government agency
or no profession

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
can solve these
problems for you.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do it for myself.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do
it for yourself.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And all the viewers have
got to do it for themselves.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Take charge of it.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Plan it.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Talk to your friends about it.

22, 1920, in Springfield,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Massachusetts, an only child.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And he took birth into
such an interesting tension,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, on
his mother's side,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
very conservative
Irish-Catholic, very tight,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
held in tight, very judgmental.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%
His father was a dentist.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.415 align:middle line:84%
But from the Learys,
who were kind

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%
of a wild, Irish,
drinking, divorcing,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
"going off and running
away" type family.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a heavy
reader as a child.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:10%
And I spent hours and
hours as a kid studying

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:10%
the heroic, and the
interesting, and the adventures

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:10%
of people who were thinking.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Timothy had an
extraordinarily complex mind

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and subtle mind.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:84%
He liked the kind of multi-level
nature of consciousness a lot.

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact
that James Joyce

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
was one of his favorite writers
is certainly a key, a blue.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:10%
And he was the
romantic Irish bard--

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:10%
also the kind of
itinerant scholar,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:10%
the kind of rascally
person at the bar.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And he seemed to play
the role of a bad guy.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> As Aldous Huxley
said, the good Dr.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Leary would serve our cause
and his own better if he could

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
resist his impulse to
cock snooks at authority.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:10%
There was a thing in Tim that
just liked to piss people off.

>> What he was at heart
was an Irish rebel.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:10%
>> But like a good Irishman,
he could just pull tricks out

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:10%
of the bag.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:10%
And he did it continually.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:10%
>> He had a twinkle in his
eye and seemed leprechaun-ish

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:10%
and mischievous.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Timothy's paternal
grandfather advised him to find

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:90%
your own way, be one of a kind.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
He acted on that guidance,
questioning authority

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:90%
every chance he got.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Following in his
father's footsteps,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Leary was a genial
hellraiser as a young man.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
At West Point, he was court
martialed for supplying liquor

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:90%
to other cadets.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, he was
cleared of the charge

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:90%
and left the academy.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Caught between the
Catholic desire to please

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and a rebellious
nature that ran deep,

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Tim spent his life
walking the edge

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:90%
between conformity and chaos.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting
the things that happen.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
He gets thrown out
of college for being

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:90%
found in a girls' dormitory.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:10%
He gets given a jail sentence
for, originally, forty years,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:10%
and it was then
reduced to 10, for--

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:10%
what-- half an ounce of grass.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was a thing about
Timothy about right and wrong,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that he was busy
being a bad boy,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.530 align:middle line:84%
but, in the rascally
sense, the playful sense.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Timothy was not mean-spirited.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.672 align:middle line:10%
He was absolutely
quite the opposite.

00:08:29.672 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Alpert, born April 6,
1931, in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:84%
His father, George
Alpert, was president

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
of the New York, New Haven,
and Hartford Railroad,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
co-founder of
Brandeis University,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and a trustee of the
synagogue the family attended.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Studying psychology, Dick earned
his master's from Wesleyan

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and a PhD at Stanford.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:10%
He taught on the faculties of
both Stanford and UC Berkeley.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Then, in 1958, he was appointed
assistant professor at Harvard.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:10%
A hometown success
at the age of 27.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I kept up a front
because I'd be scorned.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
You just didn't talk
about homosexuality.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:90%
My prep school-- oh, boy.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I went through hell, internally.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> A part of it is the privilege
that he was brought into.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And part of it is the era.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:10%
It might be a key
variant in his life

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:10%
that made him really move into
the position of an outlier.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> My homosexuality set
the stage for feeling like

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:90%
an outcast.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to you--

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:90%
in projection?

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you are--

00:10:09.398 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:90%
we don't have the words for it.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say something
like soul mate,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
or good friend and
long-term friend.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to expose this man.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's true that I'd
read more of the books.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But you were 10
times more streetwise

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:90%
than I was when we met.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I always think of myself
as kind of a nebbish--

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] --lost
soul, very square.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And you picked me up.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, you helped me.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.605 align:middle line:84%
>> But you were also a very
scared Jewish boy that wanted

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:43.405 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I was also that.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
If you asked me for
the major discovery

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
about myself and my
life, it's the confidence

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
to think for myself
and to explore.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> During the war,
Leary completed his

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
bachelor's in psychology and
was posted at the Army Medical

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Corps hospital in Pennsylvania.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:84%
There, Tim met his
first wife, Marianne.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:10%
They were married in 1945.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
He then got his masters in
psychology at Washington State.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
In 1946, they moved to San
Francisco and started a family.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Leary earned his PhD and
began clinical research

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
at UC Berkeley.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:10%
There, he developed a definitive
test for personality assessment

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:10%
and was published widely
in respected journals.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
The American
Psychological Association

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
named his first book, "The
Interpersonal Diagnosis

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of Personality," its
book of the year.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Both Leary and Marianne
were heavy drinkers.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And Marianne suffered
from severe depression.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
She committed suicide
in 1955, on the morning

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of Tim's 35th birthday,
after hearing that he

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:90%
had been having an affair.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Marianne's death haunted Tim
for the rest of his life.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
In 1958, dissatisfied
with psychology,

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
which had a success rate, he
thought, no better than chance,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Leary moved with his two
children, Susan and Jack,

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:90%
to Florence, Italy.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
There, he met David
McLellan, the director

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Harvard Center
for Personality Research.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Leary explained that
he wanted to throw out

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
the old doctor-patient model
for psychological study

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and get involved with
the subjects in real life

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:10%
McLellan was impressed.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Leary was the
brightest psychologist.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:10%
But Harvard lured him
away by offering him

00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:10%
a three-year research project.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> That summer, Timothy Leary
ate psychoactive mushrooms

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in
Cuernavaca, Mexico.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
They were offered to him
by a visiting East German

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
anthropologist who had heard
of their use among the Aztecs.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said,
here, take these.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:90%
They were interesting.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the next four hours,
he journeyed through his inner

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
landscapes and came
back a changed man.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Leary later told
Alpert that he had

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
learned more about
the mind in four hours

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:84%
than he had in his 15
years as a psychologist.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It was 1960, and he
was 40 years old.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Having an open
book on research--

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:10%
anything he wanted to do.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.015 align:middle line:84%
He, of course, wanted to
research these substances.

00:13:57.015 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>> When I went to Harvard, there
was another young professor who

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
was a very lovable,
charismatic person.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:90%
And we joined up as a time.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Richard Alpert,
who's now Ram Dass,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:90%
has been more conservative.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was at Harvard with
Timothy, I was so gung ho.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I had appointments in four
departments simultaneously,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and also research
contracts at Stanford.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastically successful.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he had appointments
at Stanford and Harvard.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:10%
And he had a plane.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:10%
And he had a car.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And he was like a shining star.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:90%
He had tremendous charisma.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I was going to graduate at
Harvard between 1960 and 1964.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I had met Dick
Alpert at a party.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I found him uncomfortable
to be around.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
He seemed to be not
comfortable in his own being.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I was like Mr. Power
Player in academia.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Timothy was way outside of that.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Of all the colleagues
around me, he frightened me

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
because he was so free.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
He was the only consciousness
on the faculty that

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been co-opted by
Harvard, that wasn't impressed

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:90%
with being at Harvard.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I saw you were
laughing at the system.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had no sense
of humor whatsoever.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not supposed
to laugh at Harvard.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.085 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody else in
Harvard laughing at it but you.

00:15:28.085 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I began to sense what
a visionary he was,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
that Timothy had the ability
to see outside of systems.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, he could
open things to where you go,

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
but it would take you a
while to get there maybe.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:90%
And he was doing that for me.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't do that.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> But the drug--

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You freed me, but
you gave me the drug.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:90%
You enticed-- not enticed me.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You told me what the possibility
was, and I trusted you.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:10%
>> In the fall of 1960, Leary
discovered that Sandoz Limited,

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:10%
a pharmaceutical company, would
send synthesized psilocybin

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:10%
to qualified researchers.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
He had access to the active
ingredient of magic mushrooms.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Leary then set up
a research program

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
to investigate the
effects of psilocybin.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Staff members trained as
guides and took the drug

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
alongside volunteer subjects
in specially prepared

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:90%
supportive settings.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:10%
This approach became
known as set and setting.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:10%


00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:10%
Careful evaluations were
made of each session.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Alpert was away at UC Berkeley,
but that Leary took psilocybin

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
for the first time at Leary's
house in Newton Center.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It stripped him of the various
identities he had built up

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:90%
in himself over 30 years.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
He wrote, "I realize
that, although everything

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
by which I knew myself--

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
even my body and
this life itself--

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
was gone, still, I
was fully aware."

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:84%
>> As professor went, and middle
class boy went, and pilot went,

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:84%
and all of my games were
going off into the distance,

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:90%
I got this terrible panic.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:84%
Because, indeed, I was
going to cease to exist.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got the panic, which
is the panic that precedes

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:90%
the psychological death.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Because indeed, Richard Alpert
was dying at that point.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And the panic was,
no, stop, stop.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I've got to hold onto something
so I'll know who I am.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And Timothy-- the
wise, old Timothy--

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
always says things like,
trust your nervous system.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
And you at dawn went home.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And you were shoveling--

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Snow.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --the snow in front of your
mother and father's house.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.535 align:middle line:84%
And your mother said, what
are you doing out there?

00:17:54.535 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> You idiot, come in.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.572 align:middle line:90%
It's 4:00 in the morning.

00:17:56.572 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Nobody shovels snow.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You said, I love you,
Mom, or something like that.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And I said, I love you.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.687 align:middle line:84%
And I went back
to shoveling snow.

00:18:01.687 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You freed me, at that
moment, from my mother.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what you did.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The psilocybin project was
widely supported and above

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:90%
reproach.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:10%
The drug was legally
obtained from Sandoz,

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:10%
the project
authorized by Harvard.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I heard about these
two professors at Harvard.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:10%
They were offering
to give people

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:10%
psilocybin in return
for having them

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:10%
write about their experiences.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I arranged to have a
session with Richard.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I felt very
comfortable with him.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, this can only
be a positive experience.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And it really confirmed a lot
of things that I had hoped

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
were true, that I
had sort of glimpsed

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
at various times in my
life-- in other words,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
that there was kind of a
larger reality than what

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
my everyday, humdrum
experiences were.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I read about mescaline, I
think after I graduated from

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
high school, and was
fascinated by it,

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
read everything I could
on it, wanted to try it.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
When I got to
Harvard, Aldous Huxley

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
had come to MIT to give
a series of lectures

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:90%
on visionary experience.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.813 align:middle line:84%
I found out that Leary and
Alpert were teaching at Harvard

00:19:21.813 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:90%
and were interested in this.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:90%
So I went over.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I made an appointment,
and I met Leary.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I had a good
conversation with him.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:84%
He told me that he thought these
drugs were the most interesting

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:90%
things he'd ever found.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And the potential was enormous.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.753 align:middle line:84%
He didn't see any
downside to them.

00:19:38.753 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I asked him if I could be
a subject in his research.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.753 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that
they'd made an agreement

00:19:42.753 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
with the university that they
couldn't use undergraduates.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So I got a supply of mescaline,
independent of anything

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:90%
to do with them.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I took it a number of times
with a group of friends of mine

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:90%
who were undergraduates.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I had variable
experiences with it--

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
one quite powerful.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
what to do with that.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me, if I followed
the implications of that,

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:90%
I would drop out of college.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.718 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't want to do that.

00:20:07.718 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:10%
So I think I boxed all
that up and set it aside.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Branching out, the
professors organized a prisoner

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:90%
rehabilitation project.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:10%
Psilocybin was given to selected
inmates at Concord State

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:10%
Prison.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:10%
Their hope was to help them
break through the habits that

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:10%
kept getting them rearrested.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Another famous study
had 30 seminary students

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
taking psilocybin at Boston
University Chapel during one

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:90%
of the year's main services.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It became known as the
Good Friday Experiment.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>> There were 16 of us in this
small chapel who had ingested.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:10%
I very soon felt the
awe coming over me.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> This was probably the
greatest Good Friday of 2,000

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.247 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:21:04.247 --> 00:21:07.586 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:07.586 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:10%
>> In the spring of 1962, just
as the psilocybin project was

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:10%
becoming almost manageable, a
British researcher arrived from

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:10%
England with a more powerful
psychoactive drug, LSD.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Lysergic acid
diethylamide was first

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
synthesized by Albert
Hofmann from a derivative

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
of ryegrass fungus at the Swiss
headquarters of Sandoz in 1938.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Five years later,
he accidentally

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:10%
got some on his
skin and discovered

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:46.582 align:middle line:10%
its mind-bending properties
during an epic bike ride home.

00:21:46.582 --> 00:21:50.534 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER]

00:21:50.534 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Hofmann not only
survived the ride,

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
but continued as a chemist
at Sandoz for many years.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:90%
He lived to be 102.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
At first, Leary
resisted the idea

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:84%
of including LSD in
the Harvard project.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Researching psilocybin
was pushing administrators

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:90%
far enough.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:10%
Another issue was
the reputation LSD

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:10%
had of being a mind control
drug researched by the military.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But his own experience
convinced Leary

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:84%
that LSD held potential
for scientific discovery

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:90%
far beyond that of psilocybin.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>> The LSD was interesting.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when he took
the LSD, he didn't

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:90%
talk for about five days.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And I got afraid
we lost Timothy.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to describe what
it was like taking LSD under

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:84%
the set and setting
of the early '60s.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:10%
The rending away from all of
these very intense paradigms

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:10%
of authority and
monotheism and culture.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> As a good
lieutenant on the ship,

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I sort of battened down the
hatches and told everybody not

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to touch the stuff
and just to wait.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And then Timothy, finally,
when he was able to speak,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
it was more like, wow,
or, whew, or, yes.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And then we all started.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Leary and Alpert saw
their research as connected

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to the centuries-long use
of psychotropic plants

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
by indigenous people
throughout the world.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic, from the Greek
word "psyche" and "delos,"

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
literally means
mind manifesting.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
After their sessions,
subjects reported

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:90%
many common perceptions--

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%
barriers dissolved.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything seemed alive,
even inanimate objects.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
They felt a oneness
with everything.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Colors and solid patterns
were transfixing, mesmerizing.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:84%
The experience seemed
to come in waves.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychotropic drugs, who
should not be recognized

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:84%
as existing or valid tools,
were demonized and glorified

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:84%
for the wrong
reasons in the '60s.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:90%
That's natural.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, know
what you're doing.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It is normal and natural
to seek altered states

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, high states.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
We do it all the
time in various ways.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Drugs are one way of
getting into them.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was two
classes of psychedelics.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
One is the ones
that are mescaline

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.298 align:middle line:84%
and its relatives-- more
stimulants than the other ones.

00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:10%
The other ones,
called indoles, which

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:10%
is LSD, and psilocybin,
and DMT, really

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:10%
are remarkably light in their
effects on the physical body.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I think, as a group, these
drugs are very non-toxic.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The main dangers are
psychological ones, of people

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:90%
becoming panicked, terrified.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think the positive
potentials are terrific.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> LSD is not a drug like
alcohol or a barbiturate.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
LSD is a chemical that contains
several hundred Encyclopedia

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Britannicas.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk to
someone who's taken LSD,

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a sitting
who's taking LSD,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:84%
his consciousness
being spun through

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
many, many different levels
of language, which are not

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:84%
the language of English or
French or Latin, but chemical

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:84%
languages of sound
and nervous system,

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
sense organs, which are
many millions of years old.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
What's the reaction to taking
LSD if the person is unprepared

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and he swallows this local
library of chemical messages?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:90%
He's confused.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:84%
He can be entranced
and delighted.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Or it can be very frightening.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:32.420 align:middle line:10%
>> The experiences, personally,
that I had with psychedelics

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:10%
was all about opening my mind.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was always, for me,
about the spiritual journey.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It affected a whole
generation of people that way.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it ended the 1950s.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It was as though the
splitting of the atom was going

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to be followed by another
kind of splitting.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was the breaking
open of the heart

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and the opening of the mind.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.480 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason that I took LSD,
and I think many of us did,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:10%
is a hunger to be an explorer.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they made me aware
of the magic in the world,

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
of seeing things not just from
the scientific perspective.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They really connected
me with nature in a way

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't before.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
They really showed
me the potential

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of how changing things in
here changes things out there.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's been a
major theme of my work.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to understand
that certain drugs really are

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:90%
sacred substances.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.192 align:middle line:84%
If you are going to use
some of the sacred drugs,

00:27:43.192 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to use them
in the right context

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:90%
with the right people.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Timothy Leary and Richard
Alpert recognized this.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the early work that
they did with psychedelics was

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:90%
very important.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They showed that set
and setting really

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
influenced the
experience greatly,

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that the mindset of
the experimenters

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:90%
greatly influenced the outcomes.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And they really demonstrated
positive potentials

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
of the use of psychedelics,
which, I think, just now,

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:84%
is becoming a focus
of attention again.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctors Joan Halifax and
Stan Grof were among the first

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to research the use of
psychedelics with the dying--

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
in their case, terminal
cancer patients in 1967.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> In the dying process,
there's often a lot of fear.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think psychedelics make
it possible to step aside

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
from that and observe what's
happening dispassionately.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:84%
A guided psychedelic
experience in a dying person

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:84%
often enables that
person to drastically cut

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
doses of opiates for
pain relief, which

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:90%
kept consciousness clear.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.380 align:middle line:84%
It often greatly
facilitated communication

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
with family and friends,
where, before, there

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:84%
was no honest communication
always going on.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And it made the
dying process easier.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it was strongly positive
results of these studies.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think surrounding the
use of drugs with ritual,

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:84%
making the occasions
of taking them special,

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:84%
paying great attention
set and setting,

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is all part of minimizing
their potential for harm.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We used to use "The
Tibetan Book of the Dead"

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.600 align:middle line:84%
as a manual for
psychedelic trips.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And that really is a
manual of leaving your body

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and going into what
they call a Bardo state.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a manual
for death, really.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the drug literature,
going back to William James

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and the Harvard people 100
years ago, they always said,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
it's a dying experience,
it's a death experience,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that there's a classic mystic
thing of joy and wonder,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not advocating,
boys and girls.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Like anything else,
it's complicated.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm very cautious.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I've taken almost
every drug there is.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I can
survive as well as I do--

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm prudent, and I'm
careful, and I try

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.400 align:middle line:90%
to find out what's involved.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.230 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, we knew almost
nothing about the brain.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Now we know 120 billion neurons.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Every neuron in your brain
has 10,000 connections.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
us decades to begin

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:84%
to understand the magnificence
and the complexity

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:31.450 align:middle line:84%
of this brain which creates
the realities we inhabit.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Leary, we
use but a small percentage

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:84%
of our nervous
system's capacity,

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that we've learned over
thousands of years to restrict

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
the use of our brains so
we can function in society.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics open the full
landscape of our minds.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It was as if all these did
was accentuate the direction

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.410 align:middle line:84%
his life was always going in,
freeing himself from systems,

00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:00.020 align:middle line:84%
freeing himself from all of
the ways that our mind creates

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:90%
our reality.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Mythic heroes travel unknown
oceans in search of adventure

00:31:08.255 --> 00:31:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and new lands.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
American astronauts were
about to launch themselves

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:90%
into outer space.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, Leary and
Alpert dedicated themselves

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.125 align:middle line:84%
to exploring the
nature of innerspace.

00:31:22.125 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the word
Timothy and I always used.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the mythic level that
Timothy and I lived at, was,

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:90%
we were adventurers.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> They averaged one LSD session
per week and took heroic doses.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
They saw themselves as
psychedelic adventurers,

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
exploring the nature of reality,
encountering both heaven

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:90%
and hell.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:84%
They openly shared the
results of their work,

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.890 align:middle line:90%
encouraging others to join them.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.130 align:middle line:84%
LSD was, at that time,
still fully legal.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It was an innocent
time and a wild ride.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Driving up to Sandoz
in New Jersey in the huge,

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:84%
black railroad limousine that
I had from my father with

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:84%
railroad wheels
on the end of it.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And Timothy and I are driving up
to buy this huge amount of LSD

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.980 align:middle line:90%
as Harvard professors.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:84%
There was so many
of those, just one

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:90%
after another after another.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Ever the scientists, Leary
and Alpert published articles

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
in journals and delivered
papers at conferences.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:90%
The word was out.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And their program was
becoming popular--

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:10%
maybe too popular.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:10%
>> It ended up so many graduate
students wanted to work with

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:10%
Leary, and almost all the
other graduate professors lost

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:10%
student assistants, you
see, which pissed them off,

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.360 align:middle line:10%
of course.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Independently,
about that same time,

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I had joined the editorial
board of "The Harvard Crimson,"

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:90%
the newspaper.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And there were stories
beginning to go around

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:84%
about the drug experiments at
Harvard and Leary and Alpert.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only person
that had knowledge of that.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it was logical that
I became the reporter who

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:90%
dealt with that.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Psilocybin was to be given
only to graduate students.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:90%
But there was one slip.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That guy that I
turned on-- one person--

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
was somebody to whom
I was attracted.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in a very
difficult role in that.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, I had
taken these drugs.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I had positive
feelings for them.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.510 align:middle line:90%
But I had a kind of dual life.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I was this straight
undergraduate

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.008 align:middle line:84%
who was doing this
investigative reporting.

00:33:41.008 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I think he wrote an article
in "The Harvard Crimson"

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:90%
talking about this.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:10%
And the parents of this
one boy found out about it,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:10%
and they went to the officials
at Harvard, and said,

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:10%
what's going on here?

00:33:53.830 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:10%
>> The dean of Harvard said,
if he didn't squeal on me,

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.840 align:middle line:10%
they're not going to
give him the diploma.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:11.469 align:middle line:84%
>> I played a key role in
getting information which

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:17.139 align:middle line:84%
eventually led to Alpert's
being fired in 1963.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.219 align:middle line:90%
Leary was never fired.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:90%
He quit voluntarily.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:84%
That story was front page
news on "The New York Times."

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
probably the first time

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that most Americans had ever
heard of psychedelic drugs,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:90%
or LSD, or mushrooms.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:84%

of a shock, to put it mildly,

to Richard, who had been the
one who was on the tenure track.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:10%

of mapped out, he thought.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I would have been
something today.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I ruined your academic career.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:90%
You absolutely did.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:84%
What happened was,
you were the one

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.800 align:middle line:84%
that showed me that it
was possible to escape

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.600 align:middle line:90%
from the system.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.800 align:middle line:90%
You really did.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:10%
It's been hard for me
to really understand

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:10%
how I was ready to hear that.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:90%

wanted to continue

their work, which was becoming
highly controversial, but still

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:90%

inherited quite a bit of money.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.450 align:middle line:10%
And they had decided, with this
money, as a good investment,

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:50.650 align:middle line:10%
to buy this huge property
in Millbrook, New York.

On the property with
an old house there

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.750 align:middle line:90%
that was the original house.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And it belonged to the person
who developed the property back

in the late 19th,
early 20th century.

I kind of wanted it to
be haunted, you know?

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It was huge, and lots of
turrets and curved glass.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:90%
It was really beautiful.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And so I talked to my brothers.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:90%
They weren't going to use it.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.018 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
sure, we'll rent you

The decade had taken
a very nasty turn.

At Millbrook, the scientists
continued their research

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:84%
into 1964, adapting
the old house

to its hipper inhabitants.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It soon became a second home

The free speech

began a reinvigoration
of democracy

that would lead to the
Summer of Love in 1967.

LSD, acid, was
often shared freely.

Years later, it became
known that the CIA ran

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.950 align:middle line:10%
secret experiments with
LSD in the 1950s and 1960s,

hoping to find a way to
use the drug in warfare.

Inevitably, some

LSD to hundreds, much

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:10%

indiscriminate use of LSD.

And I have never

Strangely enough,
my position on LSD

is exactly that of the President

The reason he was
so good at that

I'm basically gay.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I became very trustworthy
for Tim to push against,

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to lean on, in a way,
to get further out.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And Timothy was taking
me out with him.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Going out with him
wasn't all fun and games.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was extremely scary.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I had grown up in a
family that treasured antiques,

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, so that my
apartment in Cambridge,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:84%
when I was a Harvard
professor, was

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:84%
full of absolutely beautiful
antiques, highboys.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I moved
to Millbrook where

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
it was monkeys, and aardvarks,
and cats, and six dogs,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:90%
and many children.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were in a
63-room house, you know?

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And I watched my
antiques, one by--

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the intelligence
to just sell them, you know?

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I watched them all just
be destroyed before my eyes.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:84%
It was undercutting
something very deep in me.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Then, as the years went
on, something very profound

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.380 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I started to
distinguish between visionary

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and revolutionary, and
that Timothy was both.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:90%
And I loved the visionary part.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was that the
revolutionary part of it

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.780 align:middle line:84%
was costing so much,
psychically, and financially,

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.030 align:middle line:90%
and socially, and everything.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:90%
We were $50,000 in debt.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.507 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how hard I
tried, I couldn't pay it off.

00:43:04.507 --> 00:43:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And we were getting further
and further out all the time

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.840 align:middle line:84%
as we got thrown out of
more and more countries.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought, as much
fun as it was,

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.410 align:middle line:84%
now it was no
longer so much fun.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of it
was, being in a relationship

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:18.750 align:middle line:84%
with somebody that
way, ultimately,

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.210 align:middle line:84%
that other part of
you never develops.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I was
a more creative person

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:84%
than this situation
was allowing me to be.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I think that's when

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:90%
we started to pull apart.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> In the fall of 1965, Richard
Alpert left Millbrook for good.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:39.240 align:middle line:84%
The awakenings that psychedelics
provided him never lasted long.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Alpert and others
hungered for a way

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.190 align:middle line:84%
to maintain and
integrate expanded states

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.690 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, the world of
mind-manifesting substances

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.680 align:middle line:90%
became more like decoration.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.120 align:middle line:84%
In this era of the civil rights
and the anti-war movement,

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I realized that, to be
engaged politically,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I had to also be engaged
with my own mind.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.770 align:middle line:10%
And I just wanted to really
train my mind be very, very

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.960 align:middle line:10%
stable and to be
able to perceive

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:15.910 align:middle line:10%
my own mental continuum clearly
and not have it so decorated.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> As Alpert was leaving, Leary
began a new relationship with

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Rosemary Woodruff.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They closed up the
house at Millbrook

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and began a trip to Mexico with
Tim's children, Susan and Jack.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But at the border
crossing in Laredo, Texas,

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.950 align:middle line:84%
they were arrested for the
possession of less than half

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.550 align:middle line:84%
an ounce of marijuana,
for which Leary received

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:42.030 align:middle line:90%
a jail sentence of 30 years.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:46.280 align:middle line:84%
They returned to Millbrook and
began fighting the conviction.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the Supreme Court
overturned the sentence.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But Nixon was not satisfied
with that outcome.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Leary was indeed
later jailed, but

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.950 align:middle line:84%
for interstate transportation,
not possession.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not going to solve
these problems by putting

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.380 align:middle line:84%
leading scientists like myself
in jail for 30 or 40-year

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:07.730 align:middle line:84%
prison terms for doing nothing
more than attempting to use

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and understand these new forms
of energy for which yet there

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is no evidence that we've
done any damage to society

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.210 align:middle line:84%
or to ourselves or
to other people.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1966, drug use of
all kinds was on the rise

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.590 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Even though his views
were controversial,

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Leary was invited to
testify before Congress.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We have been told today and
we read in the papers reports

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:84%
from sociologists that
from between 15% to 50%--

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases, up to 65% and
70% of our college students--

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:43.100 align:middle line:84%
are experimenting with these
mind-opening chemicals.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:10%
And I recommend, respectfully,
to this committee

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:10%
that you consider
legislation which

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:52.370 align:middle line:10%
will license responsible
adults to use

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.560 align:middle line:10%
these drugs for
serious purposes,

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:10%
such as spiritual growth,
the pursuit of knowledge,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:10%
or in their own
personal development.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.050 align:middle line:84%
To obtain such a license,
the applicant, I think,

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.230 align:middle line:84%
should have to meet
physical, intellectual,

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and emotional criteria.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Your testimony I
understand extremely clearly.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming more
clear now that you

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.640 align:middle line:84%
feel that there shouldn't
be an indiscriminate--

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.380 align:middle line:84%
indiscriminate
possession is something

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.340 align:middle line:90%
that you do not support.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> For six years, sir, I
have been indiscriminate use.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Indiscriminate use, all right.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And he felt very strongly
that he would be able

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:10%
to convince Congress that
psychotropic drugs be given

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:41.180 align:middle line:10%
over to the medical profession
for healing purposes.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:41.980 align:middle line:90%
[KNOCKING]

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Police officer.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Open the door.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And he knew that, the minute
they decided to make this a law

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:53.930 align:middle line:84%
enforcement issue, it
would be everywhere.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.390 align:middle line:90%
There would be no stopping it.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would be
able to get hold of it.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.070 align:middle line:90%
That was terrible for him.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:05.770 align:middle line:84%
That's where he developed
a very strong rebel

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:09.510 align:middle line:90%
side towards the government.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> As Leary continued fighting
the government and the Texas

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:17.640 align:middle line:84%
courts, the direction of Richard
Alpert's life changed forever.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.000 align:middle line:84%
He had left the country in
1967 on a trip through Asia.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.490 align:middle line:84%
One day, in Nepal, he
met a young Westerner

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:28.220 align:middle line:84%
who had adopted the ways of
the Indian ascetics known

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.050 align:middle line:90%
as sadhus.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Bhagavan Das seemed to embody
what Richard was looking for.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.920 align:middle line:10%
So he abandoned his
first-class junket,

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.950 align:middle line:10%
and, together, they descended
barefoot into India.

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:middle line:10%
Before long, Richard
was introduced

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.850 align:middle line:10%
to the Indian saint
who would become

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:50.620 align:middle line:10%
his guru, Neem Karoli Baba,
known to his followers

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.360 align:middle line:10%
as Maharaj-ji.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Maharaj-ji gave Richard his
spiritual name, Ram Dass,

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.140 align:middle line:90%
which means "servant of God."

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>> My guru is about
a 70-year-old man.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.757 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything
about him, really.

00:48:06.757 --> 00:48:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know that he
exists, to tell you the truth.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed to
me that there was

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:11.805 align:middle line:90%
a little old man in a blanket.

00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at him, the
first time I looked at him,

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.628 align:middle line:84%
I thought I wasn't
going to be hustled.

00:48:16.628 --> 00:48:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And the second time I looked
at him, all I wanted to do

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.030 align:middle line:90%
was touch his feet.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I looked up, and he was looking
at me with unconditional love.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had never been looked
at with unconditional love

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:90%
by anybody.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:90%
I felt love.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.150 align:middle line:90%
I felt love.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I felt something
happening in my heart.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Ram Dass studied yoga and
meditation before returning

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.950 align:middle line:90%
to America a changed man

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Timothy trained me in
the beginning of my escape.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And Maharaj-ji then
took over, really.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I see them as my two
powerful teachers in escape.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.090 align:middle line:90%


00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And he comes back.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's maybe 80
pounds lighter.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting on a
lot of holy man airs

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.980 align:middle line:84%
that are particularly
grating, having seen him

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.460 align:middle line:90%
in his previous manifestation.

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
same guy, new shtick.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Encouraged by Maharaj-ji,
Ram Dass explored his Indian

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.330 align:middle line:84%
awakenings in the
book "Be Here Now,"

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:34.760 align:middle line:84%
which became a manual for
spiritual seekers throughout

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.560 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.450 align:middle line:90%


00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.840 align:middle line:10%
It was first published
in 1971, hand-stamped

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:47.190 align:middle line:10%
and inked at the Lama
Foundation in New Mexico.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.250 align:middle line:10%
Originally a limited edition
with hand-stitched pages,

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:54.000 align:middle line:10%
it is now in its 43rd printing.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> "Be Here Now" was seminal.

even, within popular

The second youth

They say, don't you feel regret?

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:55.390 align:middle line:84%

one thing I feel--

00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:57.370 align:middle line:84%
only 100,000 of
them had the decency

And drop out-- now this may
sound reckless advice today,

was dismissive of Dick

Alpert's spiritual journey,
which he saw as his merely

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
playing lieutenant to yet
another prophetic master.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%

also.

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And he treated me like sort of

>> Once Leary's long struggle
with the FBI and the Justice

Department was concluded, he
settled in Los Angeles with his

And he was the father who
raised me from ages four

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:35.710 align:middle line:84%
until 22, until he died
when I was 22 years old.

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So I lived with
him for 17 years.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And somebody pointed
out to me once

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
that I have the
great distinction

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
of living with him longer
than anybody else did, ever.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So he was just a great, very
kind of standard white picket

fence father with me.

01:01:54.767 --> 01:01:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And most people don't know that.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I tell people that,
it's really a surprise.

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:00.450 align:middle line:84%
He took me to Little
League practice.

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.640 align:middle line:84%
He played baseball
with me in the yard.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
We went to Dodger
games all the time.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.960 align:middle line:90%
He made sure I did my homework.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
shockingly normal.

of estrangement,

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Leary and Ram Dass's love for
each other as mythic explorers

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:20.380 align:middle line:90%
guided their reconnection.

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The last 20 years
have been remarkable.

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They have put us
through the changes.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%

legitimacy of his life,

and I didn't ask him
for legitimacy of mine.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
That allowed a new
kind of respect

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to emerge between us,
which was interesting.

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a respect that
honored our differences,

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
rather than the adventure
of sharing an idea.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt that Timothy
really respected me at the end.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.170 align:middle line:90%
And I certainly respected him.

>> I think everybody
is afraid to die.

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how do
you deal with the fear?

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:19.760 align:middle line:90%

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I like this incarnation.

>> Why is it so important
to talk about death?

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the unspoken
phobia of the culture.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.450 align:middle line:10%
You can see it if you look at
the major issues like abortion,

death penalty,
euthanasia, terrorism.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%

and I knew I was going to
die actively and creatively,

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I called Ram Dass, because
I knew he would understand.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:14.445 align:middle line:84%

which was a manual based on
"The Tibetan Book of the Dead."

And that led to a pretty
deep study of psychedelics.

And since we were
both dealing with what

we considered psychological
death and rebirth,

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and we had been through those
death-rebirth experiences

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
what we've missed is that the
psychological part of dying

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
is also important.

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And hospice is much cheaper
than intensive care units.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, all it requires is
that we accept the fact

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:26.120 align:middle line:90%
that death exists.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big shift,
to accept death existing,

01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
versus, it's a
failure and an enemy.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> What Ram Dass did was
really inspire people to bring

01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and existential
questions into their awareness

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
so that they could not only
die well, but also live well.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I do a lot of grief
work with people.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.830 align:middle line:10%
And what I often
am finding myself

01:07:55.830 --> 01:08:01.170 align:middle line:10%
saying to people who have lost
their child or their spouse

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:04.290 align:middle line:10%
after many years or something--

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.480 align:middle line:10%
you will grieve, and
grieve, and grieve,

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.150 align:middle line:10%
and you'll come up for air,
and think it's all over,

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.080 align:middle line:10%
and I'll be strong.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll go
back under, and you'll

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:12.450 align:middle line:90%
go through depressions.

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And let it all run its course.

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't push it.

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Your mind will
recite all the ways

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
you've lost the person,
that you'll never

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
have the smell of their
body, all these things.

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Milk it all.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't push it away.

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
But there will come a time
when your mind will quiet down

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:31.850 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the quietness
of that moment,

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
the love that you ever
tasted with that person

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.170 align:middle line:90%
will be living and present.

01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:42.479 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll realize
that what the essence was

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that made you connect
with this person

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.140 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with death.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
That love transcends
death, basically.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have to
find it out for yourself.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.149 align:middle line:10%
>> I had this tragic loss.

01:08:57.149 --> 01:09:03.479 align:middle line:10%
I had the great love of
my life drop dead on me.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I was getting this
huge overflowing

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:07.689 align:middle line:90%
of love from other people.

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was absolutely useless.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.787 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a black
hole for love.

01:09:12.787 --> 01:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make any difference
what everybody said.

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
what it felt like.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt like they
were wasting their love on me,

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.790 align:middle line:90%
which is a terrible feeling.

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
this to Ram Dass.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.550 align:middle line:90%


01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, I feel like
a bottomless well.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.930 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Love goes in, and you never
hear anything hit bottom.

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
consider the possibility

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that it's not bottomless,
that it's very deep--

01:09:47.080 --> 01:10:01.990 align:middle line:90%


01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- and that, one day,
it will fill it with love.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.990 align:middle line:90%


01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And all that still--

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.884 align:middle line:84%
[CLEARS THROAT] --it
still kind of gets me.

01:10:11.884 --> 01:10:15.350 align:middle line:90%


01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Death and someone dying is
an initiation that we as human

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
beings go through.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:22.390 align:middle line:90%
And it enriches us.

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It deepens us.

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:26.530 align:middle line:90%
It opens our hearts.

01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:28.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a terrible thing.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But I think it makes us
bigger, and deeper, and more

01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:36.160 align:middle line:90%
compassionate as people.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.330 align:middle line:90%


01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:43.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I found out I had
cancer about a year ago.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.510 align:middle line:10%
But the real pressure of it,
the symptomatic pressure of it,

01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:50.500 align:middle line:10%
is just in the last
two or three months.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.430 align:middle line:90%
I've had moments of deep pain.

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had moments when the
pain pills would almost

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:58.270 align:middle line:90%
knock me out.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was a source of
worry to my friends,

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:04.180 align:middle line:90%
because I was suffering so much.

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a shock to me
to discover that pain exists,

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.495 align:middle line:84%
and it can really dominate
your consciousness.

01:11:12.495 --> 01:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So I've had to
work that through.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:18.150 align:middle line:90%


01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> See, the issue is
pain and consciousness,

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:22.590 align:middle line:84%
the relation of pain
to consciousness.

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're looking at
it from just the physical body,

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to get rid of as
much pain as possible, even

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
if you have to put
the person to sleep,

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.450 align:middle line:90%
keep them asleep until they die.

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:37.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
humane thing to do.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Here we are six years later.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a stroke,
five years ago.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember time.

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.555 align:middle line:90%
But this is now '03.

01:11:52.555 --> 01:11:57.550 align:middle line:90%


01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In February 1997, Ram
Dass suffered a severe stroke

01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and a massive
cerebral hemorrhage.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.115 align:middle line:84%
Doctors gave him only a
10% chance of survival.

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:10.440 align:middle line:90%


01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of hours
of rehabilitation

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
later, he was still partially
paralyzed, though able

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:19.310 align:middle line:90%
to get around in a wheelchair.

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:22.400 align:middle line:84%
After years of service,
he had to learn

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.620 align:middle line:90%
to accept the help of others.

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I am more now identified with
my soul and more compassionate

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:41.540 align:middle line:90%
to my body.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
See, I don't know how I'll
be if I'm in your situation.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, I
don't feel anxious

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
at all about my
life or anything.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything, yeah, yeah.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The stroke was so painful
that I pushed it away by going

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to the witness in the soul, just
witnessing the stroke rather

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.830 align:middle line:90%
than experiencing the stroke--

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
what a psychologist
would label dissociation.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:22.589 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

01:13:22.589 --> 01:13:26.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:32.180 align:middle line:10%
My pains I treat lovingly.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Pain is a worthy adversary.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to fight it out.

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>> He has been through a lot.

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:45.030 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting to be with him.

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an absence
of self-pity there.

01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that he's been
in that chair for 15 years,

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.335 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is no joke.

01:13:53.335 --> 01:13:54.390 align:middle line:90%
He's over 80 now.

01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
That's really remarkable
that he's lived so long.

01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a testimony to his
delightful determination

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
that I think is a kind
of model for all of us.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about his essence

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.580 align:middle line:90%
which has not changed at all.

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I really feel it's love.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:15.030 align:middle line:90%


01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Ram Dass now lives in
Hawaii, cared for by a community

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.199 align:middle line:90%
of loving friends and students.

01:14:21.199 --> 01:14:21.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah!

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.580 align:middle line:90%


01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo-hoo!

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Woo!

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> He's more active than ever,
teaching, writing, counseling,

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and appearing virtually.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.233 align:middle line:90%
>> My body is 80 years old.

01:14:36.233 --> 01:14:40.250 align:middle line:90%
I am a soul.

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Although still
physically restricted,

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
he continues his work,
furthering the vision he

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:49.120 align:middle line:84%
pioneered with Timothy Leary
more than 40 years ago.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.640 align:middle line:10%
Adding to his personal legacy
is a son, Peter Reichard.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Ram Dass was introduced
to him in 2009.

01:14:56.850 --> 01:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a shock to both of them.

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:01.740 align:middle line:90%
In a million years!

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Of all the crazy things.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And what a great
guy, Peter, his son.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter had never
heard of Ram Dass,

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
let alone that he was
his biological father.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Long ago, Richard Alpert
had a brief affair

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.800 align:middle line:84%
with Peter's mother
while teaching

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
at Stanford, before his Harvard
years with Timothy Leary.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Peter was the result. But his
mother had moved back east

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.830 align:middle line:90%
and never told Richard.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, more than 50
years later, Ram Dass

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:32.040 align:middle line:84%
finds himself connected to
a new and growing family

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
in the final years of
his current incarnation.

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> The amazing thing--

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:38.730 align:middle line:84%
the great singular
accomplishment

01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
of Ram Dass's life, I
think, is that, setting up

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
from not very
promising beginnings,

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:53.500 align:middle line:84%
he has become a truly
wise person, deeply.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> If you see that the moment
of death is the moment when you

01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
engage in the deepest
mystery of the universe--

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the whole
Eastern traditions are about,

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
preparing you for that moment,
so that you will be equanimous.

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:09.220 align:middle line:90%
You will be curious.

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.330 align:middle line:90%
You'll be present.

01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:13.150 align:middle line:84%
You'll be non-clinging to
the past and not grabbing.

01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Just be with each
moment, moment by moment.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Some people do some of their
most profound spiritual work

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:23.930 align:middle line:84%
in the last few minutes
before they die.

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:28.820 align:middle line:90%


01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Wanting to get a head start--

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.570 align:middle line:84%
why leave it to
the last minute--

01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Timothy Leary at 75
approached his final days

01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
with characteristic enthusiasm.

01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:43.760 align:middle line:84%
He promised to give death a
better name or die trying.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> We're all going to die.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Why not learn how to do it with
class and style and friendship

01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:52.630 align:middle line:84%
as the climactic
expression of a life?

01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:56.540 align:middle line:84%
The last week, I have
not been using any pills.

01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a fascinating and
wonderful experience-- so far.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I've become very
friendly with my cancer.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And also, I say in public, my
cancer I see now as my teacher.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.840 align:middle line:90%
And I try to talk to her.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And I say, Miss Cancer--

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.945 align:middle line:90%
I say, we're in it together.

01:17:15.945 --> 01:17:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Yeah.

01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:18.822 align:middle line:90%
If you go, it goes.

01:17:18.822 --> 01:17:20.745 align:middle line:84%
>> We're both stuck
in the same body, see?

01:17:20.745 --> 01:17:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's make a deal.

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] Let's keep the
body alive a little while,

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.587 align:middle line:90%
and we can have more fun.

01:17:26.587 --> 01:17:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When the heart waves
flatline, the brain goes on.

01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
sliver of opportunity.

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Your life flashes
in front of you.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And you go into ecstasy.

01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The light at the
end of the tunnel?

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's all comes
from near-death experiences.

01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:45.315 align:middle line:90%
The brain is happy.

01:17:45.315 --> 01:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Because then the
brain is in the states

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.330 align:middle line:90%
that the Buddhists talk about.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.125 align:middle line:90%
It's pure consciousness.

01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:49.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:17:49.925 --> 01:17:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It's extricated itself
from all the senses.

01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:55.610 align:middle line:84%
But see, that 15 minutes is
timeless, like an LSD session.

01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You go through 95
lifetimes in death.

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:00.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, every
minute is timeless.

01:18:00.313 --> 01:18:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go, yeah.

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Like everybody
else, I'm speculating.

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And I may change.

01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:08.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to learn.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> This period that
Timothy Leary speaks about,

01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
this 15 to 20-minute period,
what that would be called

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan teaching is
still the process of dying.

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:23.800 align:middle line:90%
So you're not dead yet.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.740 align:middle line:84%
But the gross body is
dead, but the subtle body

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.370 align:middle line:90%
is still remaining in the body.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he's identifying.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> At this period
in human history,

01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
we're lucky enough to be here
when, for the first times,

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.370 align:middle line:84%
science is developing ways to
keep you alive or to bring you

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:42.180 align:middle line:90%
back.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:44.730 align:middle line:84%
The church has said, no,
you have no right to take--

01:18:44.730 --> 01:18:46.020 align:middle line:90%
your body belongs to God.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:49.732 align:middle line:90%
Well, show me the paperwork.

01:18:49.732 --> 01:18:52.690 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER]

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> By 1993, Timothy and
Barbara had divorced,

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:59.350 align:middle line:84%
although Tim remained
close to her son Zach.

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>> He had a lot of personal
heartache in his life.

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
His wife Marianne
killed herself.

01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:06.020 align:middle line:10%
And every marriage
ended in divorce.

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:08.025 align:middle line:10%
His daughter Susan
also committed suicide.

01:19:08.025 --> 01:19:09.750 align:middle line:10%
And Jack didn't speak to him.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:12.422 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot
of heavy stuff going

01:19:12.422 --> 01:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
on there, a lot of
heavy karmas and a lot

01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
of interpersonal relationships
that he just really

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:18.060 align:middle line:90%
couldn't work out.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
really broke his heart.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was no question that
him getting to raise me again

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
was a chance for him
to do it over again.

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:34.050 align:middle line:84%
He had an uncanny knack
to reinvent himself.

01:19:34.050 --> 01:19:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the late
'80s and into the '90s,

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.570 align:middle line:84%
he was much more of
a cyber culture icon

01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:42.240 align:middle line:90%
than he was a '60s hippie icon.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he kept
young people around,

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
because he was so fascinated
with youth culture,

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and with computer
culture, and early

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
internet culture, and cyberpunk
culture, and music culture,

01:19:52.890 --> 01:19:54.450 align:middle line:90%
and art.

01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Every technique that science
has now for bringing you back

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.930 align:middle line:90%
I've been signed up with.

01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:00.720 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER]

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have my blood
cells available for cloning.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.860 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.800 align:middle line:10%
>> It's inconceivable to me
that Timothy could have taken

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.020 align:middle line:10%
as much acid as he's taken
and been through as much

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.130 align:middle line:10%
as he's been through and end
up a philosophical materialist

01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:16.680 align:middle line:10%
in which, when the body
is dead, you're dead.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Yet that's what he professed.

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Why did it end up that
you're interested in things

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
here and now, and I'm interested
in lala land all the time?

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not really.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I am.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean?

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.640 align:middle line:90%
What's lala land?

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm interested in the
awareness that happens after

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.280 align:middle line:90%
the brain gets eaten.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
When I think about
the moment of death,

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I usually think of
a great acid trip.

01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I think of the dissolution
of conceptual structures.

01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:49.680 align:middle line:90%


01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I have, under my
personal supervision,

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:56.130 align:middle line:84%
witnessed over 3,000
injections of LSD.

01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Over 3,000.

01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:02.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, can you briefly
describe the effect of it?

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:05.880 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHS] No, sir.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
You might say I
was sitting there,

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, I
began to dissolve.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.583 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in my body
began to break down.

01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was though
I was afraid I'd

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.550 align:middle line:90%
become a puddle on the floor.

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Then I saw a huge
serpent coming up.

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.950 align:middle line:90%
The serpent swallowed me.

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
I went into the
serpent's stomach.

01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Later, I was excreted,
and I exploded.

01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:29.290 align:middle line:10%
Then--

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:32.070 align:middle line:10%
>> You see Teddy Kennedy there.

01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:33.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, my gosh.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
These guys must have been
having their own little mental

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:38.600 align:middle line:90%
breakdown listening to him.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And by this time,
even the most experienced

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and hard-bitten psychiatrist
is likely to be crouching under

01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
the table and saying, in
30 years of my practice,

01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I've never listened to anything
so frightening and so far out.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, actually, if you told
this story to a Hindu,

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:56.192 align:middle line:84%
he'd say, oh, yes, the
third dream of Vishnu.

01:21:56.192 --> 01:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, that's just like the
11th chapter of "The Bhagavad

01:21:58.650 --> 01:21:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Gita."

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But we also have neurological
and anatomical explanations

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
for the so-called
hallucinations of LSD.

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Hallucinations are not
mysterious or supernatural.

01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Hallucinations are the nervous
system having experiences

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.170 align:middle line:90%
for which we don't have words.

01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the dying process
of the psychological realm.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of dissolving
of the perspective

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:25.920 align:middle line:90%
from which you're standing.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.410 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is one of the
things that's happening

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.510 align:middle line:90%
while people are dying.

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, I feel,
you're catapulted out

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.260 align:middle line:90%
into non-conceptual space.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.917 align:middle line:84%
Is that the way
you're imagining it?

01:22:36.917 --> 01:22:37.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:38.675 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant.

01:22:38.675 --> 01:22:45.990 align:middle line:10%
>> So my sense of the continuity
of awareness beyond the brain

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:49.650 align:middle line:10%
is just my wanting to
keep something going?

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have that.

01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:52.905 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you don't have it.

01:22:52.905 --> 01:22:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm curious.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> You're curious.

the beings with whom
you're going to spend

01:30:12.465 --> 01:30:18.920 align:middle line:90%
your life and your death.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:25.250 align:middle line:84%
If you have identified with
your soul when you're alive,

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:28.710 align:middle line:90%
death is just another moment.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:34.500 align:middle line:90%
In ourselves, it's all there.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.960 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.360 align:middle line:90%
God is awareness.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we tune
into our awareness,

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:48.360 align:middle line:84%
we close the space between
the individual and God.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:52.410 align:middle line:90%
You delve deep into the moment.

01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:55.760 align:middle line:90%
You come to all and everything.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:58.010 align:middle line:90%
One becomes the moment.

01:31:03.164 --> 01:31:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Life and death are one.

01:31:06.370 --> 01:31:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It's ecstatic.

01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:12.547 align:middle line:90%
It's like becoming God.

01:31:12.547 --> 01:31:14.543 align:middle line:90%
It's-- ah.

01:31:14.543 --> 01:31:26.580 align:middle line:90%

enriched my life.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Ram Dass, you have
enriched my life.

01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I can be Richard.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:32.624 align:middle line:90%
I'm Richard to you.

01:31:32.624 --> 01:31:34.124 align:middle line:84%
>> You've enriched
my life, Richard.

01:31:34.124 --> 01:31:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so proud of both of us.

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for making
this opportunity for us

01:31:39.930 --> 01:31:41.460 align:middle line:90%
to make love in public.

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I think this has been great.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> 35 years, we've
been dancing like this.

01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:47.888 align:middle line:84%
It's been a hell of
a dance, hasn't it?

01:31:47.888 --> 01:31:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're totally different.

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:49.705 align:middle line:90%
Not totally different.

01:31:49.705 --> 01:31:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So different.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:50.580 align:middle line:90%
So different.

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> But at this moment, we
so appreciate each other.

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.554 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that nice?

01:31:55.554 --> 01:31:56.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Big hug.

01:31:56.354 --> 01:31:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Here, I'll give everything.
