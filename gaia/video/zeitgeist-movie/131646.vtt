He is the son anthropomorphized.

the sun's movement in the sky.

we know much about

For instance, Horace,
being the sun or the light,

had an enemy known as Set.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:10%
And Set was the personification
of the darkness or night.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:10%
And metaphorically speaking,
every morning, Horace

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:10%
would win the battle against
Set while, in the evening,

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.945 align:middle line:10%
Set would conquer Horace and
send him into the underworld.

00:12:33.945 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It is important
to note that dark

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
versus light or
good versus evil is

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the most ubiquitous

on many levels to this day.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Broadly speaking, the story
of Horus is as follows.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Horus was born on December
25 of the Virgin Isis-Mary.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.480 align:middle line:84%
His birth was accompanied
by a star in the east.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And upon his birth, he
was adored by three kings.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 12, he was
a prodigal child teacher.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 30,
he was baptized

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
by a figure known as Anup
and, thus, began his ministry.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:10%
Horace had 12 disciples he
traveled about with performing

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:10%
miracles, such as healing the
sick and walking on water.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Horace was known
by many gestural

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%

"The Good Shepherd," "The
Lamb of God," and many others.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
After being betrayed
by Typhon, Horus

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
was crucified, buried for three
days, and thus resurrected.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
These attributes of Horus,
whether original or not,

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%

cultures of the world,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:10%
and many others.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:10%
And upon his death,
he was resurrected.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:10%
Mithra of Persia, born of
a virgin on December 25.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:10%
He had 12 disciples
and performed miracles.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:10%
And upon his death, was
buried for three days

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.854 align:middle line:10%
and thus resurrected.

00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:10%
He was also referred to as
"The Truth," "The Light,"

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.390 align:middle line:10%
and many others.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.463 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, the sacred day
of worship of Mithra was Sunday.

00:14:38.463 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is,
there are numerous saviors

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:84%
from different periods from
all over the world which

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
subscribe to these
general characteristics.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
The question remains,
why these attributes?

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Why the virgin birth
on December 25?

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Why dead for three days and
the inevitable resurrection?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Why 12 disciples or followers?

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
To find out, let's
examine the most recent

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.415 align:middle line:90%
of the solar messiahs.

00:15:05.415 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Jesus Christ was born of the
Virgin Mary on December 25

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:90%
in Bethlehem.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.756 align:middle line:84%
His birth was announced by
a star in the east, which

00:15:14.756 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
three kings or magi
follow to locate and adore

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
the new savior.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:90%
He was a child teacher at 12.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And at the age of 30, he was
baptized by John the Baptist.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.567 align:middle line:90%
And thus, began his ministry.

00:15:24.567 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Jesus had 12 disciples which he
traveled about with performing

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
miracles, such as healing
the sick, walking on water,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.704 align:middle line:90%
raising the dead.

00:15:30.704 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
He is also known as the "King
of Kings," the "Son of God,"

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
the "Light of the World," the
"Alpha and Omega," the "Lamb

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:90%
of God," and many, many others.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
After being betrayed
by his disciple Judas

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and sold for 30
pieces of silver,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
he was crucified, placed in
a tomb and, after three days,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
was resurrected and
ascended into heaven.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.744 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the birth sequence
is completely astrological.

00:15:54.744 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The star in the east is Sirius,
the brightest star in the night

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
sky which, on December 24,
aligns with the three brightest

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
stars in Orion's belt. These
three bright stars in Orion's

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
belt are called
today what they were

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
called in ancient
times, the Three Kings.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Three Kings
and the brightest star,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, all point to the place
of the sunrise on December 25.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Three Kings
follow the star in the east,

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to locate the
sunrise, the birth of the sun.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin Mary is the
constellation Virgo, also known

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:90%
as Virgo the Virgin.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.754 align:middle line:90%
Virgo, in Latin, means "virgin."

00:16:39.754 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Virgo was also referred
to as the House of Bread.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And the representation
of Virgo is a virgin

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:90%
holding a sheaf of wheat.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
This house of bread
and its symbol of wheat

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
represents August and
September, the time of harvest.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
In turn, Bethlehem,
in fact, literally

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:90%
translates to "House of Bread."

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Bethlehem is thus a reference
to the constellation Virgo,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
a place in the
sky, not on Earth.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
There is another very
interesting phenomenon

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that occurs around December
25 or the winter solstice.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
From the summer solstice
to the winter solstice,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
the days become
shorter and colder.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And from the perspective
of the northern hemisphere,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.990 align:middle line:84%
the sun appears to
move south and get

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:90%
smaller and more scarce.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:10%
The shortening of the days and
the expiration of the crops

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:10%
when approaching
the winter solstice

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:10%
symbolized the process
of death to the ancients.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:10%
It was the death of the sun.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:10%
And by December 22, the sun's
demise was fully realized.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:10%
For the sun, having moved south
continually for six months,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:10%
makes it to its lowest
point in the sky.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:10%
Here, a curious thing occurs.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:10%
The sun stops moving south,
at least perceivably,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:10%
for three days.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:10%
And during this
three-day pause, the sun

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:10%
resides in the vicinity
of the Southern Cross,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:10%
or Crux constellation.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:10%
And after this time,
on December 25,

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.740 align:middle line:10%
the sun moves one
degree, this time north,

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:10%
foreshadowing longer days
of warmth and spring.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:10%
And thus it was said,
the sun died on a cross,

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:10%
was dead for three days, only
to be resurrected or born again.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.910 align:middle line:84%
This is why Jesus and
numerous other sun

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
gods share the crucifixion,
three-day death,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:90%
and Resurrection concept.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:84%
It is the sun's
transition period,

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
before it shifts
its direction back

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
into the northern
hemisphere, bringing

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:90%
spring and thus salvation.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:10%
However, they did not celebrate
the resurrection of the sun

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:10%
until the spring
equinox, or Easter.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:10%
This is because at
the spring equinox,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:10%
the sun officially overpowers
the evil darkness as daytime

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:10%
thereafter becomes longer
in duration than the night

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:10%
and the revitalizing
conditions of spring emerge.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, probably the
most obvious of all

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
the astrological
symbolism around Jesus

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:90%
regards the 12 disciples.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
They are simply the
12 constellations

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.803 align:middle line:84%
of the zodiac which Jesus, being
the sun, travels about with.

00:19:08.803 --> 00:19:12.667 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the number 12 is
replete throughout the Bible.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to the cross of
the zodiac, the figurative life

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
of the sun-- this was not just
an artistic expression or tool

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:90%
to track the sun's movement.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
It was also a pagan spiritual
symbol, the short end

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:90%
of which looked like this.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:84%
This is not a symbol
of Christianity.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It is a pagan adaptation
of the cross of the zodiac.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:10%
This is why Jesus,
in early occult art,

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:10%
is always shown with
his head on the cross,

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:08.920 align:middle line:10%
for Jesus is the sun, the Son
of God, the Light of the World,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:10%
the Risen Savior
who will come again,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:10%
as it does every morning;
the glory of God who

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:10%
defends against the
works of darkness,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:10%
as he is born
again every morning

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:10%
and can be seen coming in
the clouds up in heaven,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.405 align:middle line:10%
with his crown of
thorns or sun-rays.

00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, of the many astrological
astronomical metaphors

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, one of
the most important

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
has to do with the ages.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the scriptures,
there are numerous references

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:90%
to the "age."

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
In order to understand
this, we need

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to be familiar with
the phenomenon known

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
as the procession
of the equinoxes.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians, along
with cultures long before them,

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
recognized that approximately
every 2,150 years, the sunrise

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
on the morning of
the spring equinox

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
would occur in a different
sign of the zodiac.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with
a slow angular wobble

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.274 align:middle line:84%
that the earth maintains
as it rotates on its axis.

00:21:17.274 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:84%
It is called a procession
because the constellations

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.474 align:middle line:84%
go backwards rather than
through the normal yearly cycle.

00:21:22.474 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:10%
The amount of time it
takes for the procession

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:10%
to go through all 12 signs
is roughly 25,765 years.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:10%
This is also called
the Great Year.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:10%
And ancient societies
were very aware of this.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And they referred to each
2,150-year period as an "age."

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.875 align:middle line:10%
From 4300 BC to 2150 BC, it was
the Age of Taurus, the Bull.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:10%
From 2150 BC to 1 AD, it was
the Age of Aries, the Ram.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:10%
And from 1 AD to 2150
AD, it is the Age

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.516 align:middle line:10%
of Pisces, the age we
are still in to this day.

00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:10%
And in and around 2150,
we will enter the new age,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.620 align:middle line:10%
the Age of Aquarius.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Bible reflects,
broadly speaking,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
a symbolic movement
through three ages,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
while foreshadowing a fourth.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament,
when Moses comes down

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Mount Sinai with
the 10 Commandments,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:84%
he's very upset
to see his people

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:90%
worshipping a golden bull calf.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he shattered
the stone tablets

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and instructed his people
to kill each other, in order

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:90%
to purify themselves.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Most biblical scholars
will attribute this anger

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that the Israelites
were worshipping a false idol

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:10%
The reality is, the golden
bull is Taurus the Bull.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:10%
And Moses represents the
new age of Aries the Ram.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.560 align:middle line:10%
This is why Jews, even today,
still blow the ram's horn.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Moses represents the
new Age of Aries.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And upon the new age, everyone
must shed the old age.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:10%
Other deities mark these
transitions as well,

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:10%
such as Mithra, a
pre-Christian god who kills

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:10%
the bull in the same symbology.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, Jesus is the
figure who ushers

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:10%
in the age following Aries, the
Age of Pisces or the two fish.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:10%
Fish symbolism is very
abundant in the New Testament.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Jesus feeds 5,000 people
with bread and two fish.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
When he begins his ministry
walking along Galilee,

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
he befriends friends two
fishermen who follow him.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
all seen the Jesus fish

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:90%
on the back of people's cars.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Little do they know
what it actually means.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It is a pagan astrological
symbolism for the sun's kingdom

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:90%
during the Age of Pisces.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Also, Jesus' assumed
birth date is essentially

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:90%
the start of this age.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:84%
At Luke 22:10, when Jesus
is asked by his disciples

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:84%
where the last
Passover would be,

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Jesus replies, "Behold, when
ye are entered into the city,

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
there shall a man meet you
bearing a pitcher of water.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Follow him into the house
where he entereth in."

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:84%
This scripture is, by far,
one of the most revealing

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
of all the astrological
references.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:10%
The man bearing the
pitcher of water

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:10%
is Aquarius, the Water Bearer,
who is always pictured as a man

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:10%
pouring out a pitcher of water.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:84%
He represents the
age after Pisces.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:10%
And when the sun--
God's son-- leaves

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:10%
the Age of Pisces--
Jesus-- it will

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.410 align:middle line:10%
go into the House of
Aquarius, as Aquarius

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:10%
follows Pisces in the
procession of the equinoxes.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:10%
All Jesus is saying is that,
after the Age of Pisces,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:10%
will come the Age of Aquarius.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have all
heard about the end

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:90%
times and the end of the world.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:84%
The cartoonish depictions
in the Book of Revelation

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
aside, a main source of this
idea comes from Matthew 28:20,

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus says, I
will be with you even

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:90%
to the end of the world.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
King James version,

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
"world" is a mistranslation,
among many mistranslations.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The actual word being used
is "aeon," which means "age."

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I will be with you, even to the
end of the age, which is true,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:84%
as Jesus' solar Piscean
personification will

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:84%
end when the sun enters
the Age of Aquarius.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:84%
The entire concept of end
times and the end of the world

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:84%
is a misinterpreted
astrological allegory.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's tell that to the
approximately 100 million

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
people in America who believe
the end of the world is coming.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, the
character of Jesus

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
being a literary and
astrological hybrid

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:84%
is most explicitly
a plagiarization

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:90%
of the Egyptian sun god Horus.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:10%
For example, inscribed
about 3500 years ago

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:10%
on the walls of the
Temple of Luxor in Egypt

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:10%
are images of the annunciation,
the miracle conception,

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:10%
the birth, and the
adoration of Horus.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:10%
The images begin with Thoth
announcing to the Virgin Isis

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:10%
that she will conceive Horus;
then Neth, the Holy Ghost,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:10%
impregnating the Virgin;
and then, the virgin birth

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:10%
and the adoration.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly the story of
Jesus' miracle conception.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
literary similarities

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
between the Egyptian religion
and the Christian religion

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:90%
are staggering.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And the plagiarism
is continuous.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.200 align:middle line:84%
The story of Noah and
Noah's ark is taken directly

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.406 align:middle line:90%
from tradition.

00:26:50.406 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
the great flood is

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
ubiquitous throughout the
ancient world, with over 200

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:84%
cited claims in different
periods and times.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
However, one need
look no further

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:84%
for a pre-Christian source
than the Epic of Gilgamesh,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:90%
written in 2600 BC.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:10%
This story talks
of a great flood

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:10%
commanded by God, an ark
with saved animals upon it,

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:10%
and even the release and
return of a dove, all

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:10%
held in common with
the biblical story,

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.995 align:middle line:10%
among many other similarities.

00:27:19.995 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, there is the
plagiarized story of Moses.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Upon Moses' birth,
it is said that he

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.470 align:middle line:84%
was placed in a reed basket
and set adrift in a river

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:90%
in order to avoid infanticide.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:10%
He was later rescued by
a daughter of royalty

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:10%
and raised by her as a prince.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:10%
This baby-in-a-basket story was
lifted directly from the myth

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:10%
of Sargon of Akkad
of around 2250 BC.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:10%
Sargon was born, placed
in a reed basket in order

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.630 align:middle line:10%
to avoid infanticide, and
set adrift in a river.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:10%
He was, in turn,
rescued and raised

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:10%
by Akki, a royal midwife.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.900 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, Moses is
known as the law-giver,

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:10%
the giver of the 10
Commandments, the Mosaic law.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
However, the idea of a law being
passed from God to a prophet

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
upon a mountain is
also a very old motif.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Moses is just another law-giver
in a long line of law-givers

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:90%
in mythological history.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.460 align:middle line:84%
In India, Manou was
the great lawgiver.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.020 align:middle line:84%
In Crete, Minos ascended
Mount Dicta, where

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Zeus gave him the sacred laws.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.300 align:middle line:84%
While in Egypt, there was Mises,
who carried stone tablets.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And upon them, the laws
of God were written.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Manou, Minos, Mises, Moses.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the
10 Commandments,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
they are taken
outright from Spell 125

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:84%
in "The Egyptian
Book of the Dead."

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:84%
What "The Book of the Dead"
phrased, "I have not stolen,"

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.670 align:middle line:84%
became "thou shall not
steal." "I have not killed"

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
became "thou shall not
kill." "I have not told lies"

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
became "thou shall not bear
false witness," and so forth.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Egyptian
religion is likely

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:84%
the primary
foundational basis for

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:90%
the Judeo-Christian theology.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Baptism, after life, final
judgment, virgin birth, death

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and resurrection,
crucifixion, the Ark

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant, circumcision,
saviors, holy communion,

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
great flood, Easter, Christmas,
Passover, and many, many more

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
are all attributes
of Egyptian ideas,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:84%
long predating
Christianity and Judaism.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:10%
Justin Martyr, one of the
first Christian historians

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:10%
and defenders,
wrote, "When we say

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:10%
that He, Jesus
Christ, our teacher,

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:10%
was produced without
sexual union,

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:10%
was crucified and died and rose
again and ascended into heaven,

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:10%
we propound nothing
different from what

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:10%
you believe regarding those who
you esteem sons of Jupiter."

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:10%
In a different
writing, Justin Martyr

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:10%
said, "He was born of a virgin.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:10%
Accept this in common with
what you believe of Perseus."

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:10%
It's obvious that Justin
and other early Christians

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:10%
knew how similar Christianity
was to the pagan religions.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:90%
However, Justin had a solution.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:10%
As far as he was concerned,
the devil did it.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:10%
The devil had the foresight
to come before Christ

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:10%
and create his characteristics
in the pagan world.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:10%
>>Fundamentalist
Christianity-- fascinating.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:25.250 align:middle line:10%
These people actually believe
the world is 12,000-years-old.

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.050 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:10%
Swear to god.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.494 align:middle line:10%
I actually asked one of these
guys, OK, dinosaur fossils.

00:30:32.494 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:90%
He says, dinosaur fossils?

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:84%
God put those here
to test our faith.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I think God put you here
to test my faith, dude.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>The Bible is nothing more
than astro-theological literary

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:84%
hybrid, just like nearly all
religious myths before it.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the aspect
of transference

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:84%
of one character's
attributes to a new character

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.340 align:middle line:84%
can be found within
the book itself.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.370 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament, there
is the story of Joseph.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Joseph it was a
prototype for Jesus.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Joseph was born of
a miracle birth.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was born of
a miracle birth.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Joseph was of 12 brothers.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Jesus had 12 disciples.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Joseph was sold for
20 pieces of silver.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.660 align:middle line:10%
Jesus was sold for
30 pieces of silver.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:10%
Brother Judah suggests
the sale of Joseph.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.400 align:middle line:10%
Disciple Judas suggests
the sale of Jesus.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:10%
Joseph began his work
at the age of 30.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:10%
Jesus began his work
at the age of 30.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:10%
The parallels go on and on.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, is there any
non-biblical historical

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
evidence of any person
living with the named Jesus,

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:84%
the son of Mary, who traveled
about with 12 followers healing

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.280 align:middle line:90%
people and the like?

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
There are numerous
historians who

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:84%
lived in and around
the Mediterranean

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:84%
either during or soon after
the assumed life of Jesus.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.140 align:middle line:84%
How many of these historians
document this figure?

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Not one.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.040 align:middle line:84%
However, to be
fair, that doesn't

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
mean defenders of
the historical Jesus

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:90%
haven't claimed the contrary.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Four historians are
typically referenced

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:90%
to justify Jesus' existence.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Pliny the Younger,
Suetonius, and Tacitus

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:90%
are the first three.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.480 align:middle line:10%
Each one of their
entries consists

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.970 align:middle line:10%
of only a few sentences
at best, and only

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:10%
refer to Chrestus or the
Christ which, in fact, is not

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:10%
a name but a title.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.670 align:middle line:90%
It means "the anointed one."

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:90%
The fourth source is Josephus.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.270 align:middle line:10%
And this source has been proven
to be a forgery for hundreds

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:10%
of years.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, it is still
cited as truth.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.795 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.795 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
You would think that a guy who
rose from the dead and ascended

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:84%
into heaven for all eyes
to see and performed

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the wealth of miracles
acclaimed to him

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:84%
would have made it into
the historical record.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It didn't because, once
the evidence is weighed,

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:84%
there are very high odds that
the figure known as Jesus

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
did not even exist.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:90%

correct in what we understand

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:10%
and know to be true.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:10%
Christianity just is
not based on truth.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.130 align:middle line:84%
We find that Christianity
was, in fact,

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.680 align:middle line:84%
nothing more than a Roman
story developed politically.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>The reality is, Jesus
was the solar deity

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:90%
of the gnostic Christian sect.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And like all other pagan gods,
he was a mythical figure.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It was the political
establishment

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that sought to
historize the Jesus

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:90%
figure for social control.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.370 align:middle line:84%
In 325 AD in Rome,
Emperor Constantine

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.980 align:middle line:90%
convened the Council of Nicaea.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
It was during this meeting
that the politically-motivated

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Christian doctrines
were established.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And thus began a long history
of religious bloodshed

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.690 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual fraud.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And for over the
next 1,000 years,

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:84%
the Vatican maintained
a political stranglehold

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:84%
on all of Europe, leading
to such joyous periods

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:84%
as the Dark Ages along
with "enlightening"

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%

and the Inquisition.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Christianity, along with all
other related theologies,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:90%
is an historical fraud.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.750 align:middle line:84%
These religions now serve
to detach the species

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
from the natural world
and, likewise, each other.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They support blind
submission to authority.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.659 align:middle line:84%
They reduce human
responsibility to the effect

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.000 align:middle line:90%
that God controls everything.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, awful
crimes can be justified

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:90%
in the name of a divine pursuit.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And most critically, it empowers
the political establishment

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.160 align:middle line:84%

to manipulate and control

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:90%

of the most powerful devices

ever created.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:84%

widely believed, is false.

In a deeper sense, in
the religious sense,

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.770 align:middle line:10%
a myth serves as an orienting
and mobilizing story

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.530 align:middle line:10%
for a people.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.800 align:middle line:10%
The focus is not on the
story's relation to reality,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.500 align:middle line:10%
but on its function.

In Falls Church, Virginia,
right next to CIA headquarters.

stages of September 11.

>>This failure to
provide proof was later

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:04.760 align:middle line:10%
said to be unnecessary, because
Bin Laden, in a video allegedly

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.210 align:middle line:10%
found in Afghanistan, admitted
responsibility for the attacks.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:28.860 align:middle line:90%

to handle all the investments
in the United States

for the Bin Laden family.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Jim Bath also happens to be
a personal, almost lifelong

friend, and former
Air National Guard

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.270 align:middle line:90%

The connections
between the Bushes

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and the Bin Ladens
become much more clear

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:84%
when George Herbert
Walker Bush made trips

00:45:54.990 --> 00:46:00.120 align:middle line:84%
to Saudi Arabia in 1998 and
2000 to meet with the Bin Laden

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.260 align:middle line:84%
family on behalf of a company
called the Carlyle Group.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:28.240 align:middle line:90%

125-foot-wide, 44-foot-tall

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.900 align:middle line:10%
plane through this
obstacle course?

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>The aircraft, before
striking the Pentagon,

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:43.540 align:middle line:84%
reportedly executed a 270
degree downward spiral.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet, Hani Hanjour was
known as a terrible pilot

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.680 align:middle line:84%
who could not safely
fly even a small plane.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:47:01.660 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>No seats, no
luggage, no bodies.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.556 align:middle line:84%
Nothing but bricks
and limestone.

00:47:06.556 --> 00:47:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>The official explanation
is that the intense heat

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.990 align:middle line:84%
from the jet fuel
vaporized the entire plane.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Flight 77 had two
Rolls Royce engines

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:17.290 align:middle line:84%
made of steel and titanium
alloy and weigh six tons each.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It is scientifically
impossible that 12 tons

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of steel and titanium was
vaporized by jet fuel.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>We were also told
that the bodies were

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:29.170 align:middle line:84%
able to be identified
either by their fingerprints

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.850 align:middle line:90%
or by the DNA.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:34.320 align:middle line:10%
So what kind of fire can
vaporize aluminum and tempered

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.930 align:middle line:10%
steel and yet leave
human bodies intact?

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>From my close up
inspection, there's

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.940 align:middle line:84%
no evidence of a plane
having crashed anywhere

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.080 align:middle line:90%
near the Pentagon.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, the only
pieces left that you can see

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
are small enough that you
could pick up in your hand.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Shortly after the
strike, government agents

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.520 align:middle line:84%
picked up debris
and carried it off.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.850 align:middle line:84%
The entire lawn was covered
with dirt and gravel,

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:01.150 align:middle line:84%
so that any remaining forensic
evidence was literally

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.080 align:middle line:90%
covered up.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:10%
The videos from
security cameras,

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.820 align:middle line:10%
which would show what
really hit the Pentagon,

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:10%
were immediately confiscated
by agents of the FBI.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Department of
Justice has, to this day,

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.810 align:middle line:90%
refused to release them.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.560 align:middle line:84%
If these videos would prove
that the Pentagon was really

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.490 align:middle line:84%
hit by a 757, most of us
would assume the government

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.590 align:middle line:90%
would release them.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:35.280 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>It looks like there's
nothing there except for a hole

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.670 align:middle line:90%
in the ground.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:39.753 align:middle line:90%
>>Basically, that's right.

00:48:39.753 --> 00:48:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you could
see from where we were,

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:84%
was a big gouge in the
earth and some broken trees.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:84%
We could see some people
working, walking around

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.960 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But from where we could
see, there wasn't much left.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Any large pieces
of debris at all?

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>No, there was nothing, nothing
that you could distinguish

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.650 align:middle line:90%
that a plane had crashed there.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:90%


00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>>The FBI and the
state police here

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.770 align:middle line:10%
have confirmed that
they have cordoned off

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:10%
a second area about
six to eight miles away

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.640 align:middle line:10%
from the crater here.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.980 align:middle line:84%
This is apparently
another debris site.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Why would debris be
located six miles away?

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.336 align:middle line:84%
Could it have blown
that far away?

00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:26.580 align:middle line:90%
It seems highly unlikely.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Pancake theory--
according to which,

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.220 align:middle line:84%
the fires, while not
melting the steel,

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.890 align:middle line:84%
heated it up
sufficiently to cause

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the floors, weakened by
the airplane strikes,

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to break loose from
the steel columns.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And this started
a chain reaction.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>So you would expect then,
from that theory-- which

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is the official theory-- to see
a whole stack of floors piled

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:00.340 align:middle line:84%
up on top of each other and,
then, a spindle of core columns

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.300 align:middle line:90%
standing too.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>The core of each
of the Twin Towers

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:84%
consisted of 47
massive steel columns.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.042 align:middle line:84%
If the floors had
broken loose from them,

00:50:08.042 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:84%
these columns would have
still been sticking up

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.100 align:middle line:90%
into the air 1,000 feet.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.232 align:middle line:84%
>>The plane did not cut
all those core columns.

00:50:15.232 --> 00:50:16.690 align:middle line:10%
>>We designed the
buildings to take

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:21.340 align:middle line:10%
the impact of the
Boeing 707 hitting

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.750 align:middle line:10%
the building at any location.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.390 align:middle line:10%
>>The building
probably could sustain

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:28.250 align:middle line:10%
multiple impacts of jetliners.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.400 align:middle line:10%
>>That the plane flew
straight into the building--

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.650 align:middle line:10%
>>Straight through him, right.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:32.050 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:33.724 align:middle line:10%
>>So you're saying that
the building was actually

00:50:33.724 --> 00:50:35.598 align:middle line:10%
designed to cope
with a hole like that

00:50:35.598 --> 00:50:36.556 align:middle line:10%
and then still survive?

00:50:36.556 --> 00:50:37.820 align:middle line:10%
>>Right, yeah, it was.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.740 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>If you had dropped, say,
a billiard ball from the top

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.650 align:middle line:84%
of the World Trade Center,
110 floors up there,

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.570 align:middle line:84%
it would have taken
8 to 10 seconds

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:50.050 align:middle line:84%
to hit the ground, encountering
no resistance whatsoever.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:53.020 align:middle line:10%
>>The Twin Towers came down
at nearly free-fall speed.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.170 align:middle line:10%
200,000 tons of steel
shatters and explodes

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:57.890 align:middle line:10%
outwards over 500 feet.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>This means that floors
shattered at an average rate

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.280 align:middle line:90%
of about 10 floors per second.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>There is no scenario
for a pancake effect

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.510 align:middle line:84%
of buildings falling
that allows them to fall

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:08.760 align:middle line:90%
at the rate of free-fall.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Now, what can do that?

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.735 align:middle line:84%
What can move mass
out of the way?

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:12.535 align:middle line:90%
Explosives.

00:51:12.535 --> 00:51:20.290 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>47 huge steel columns
going up the core,

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.450 align:middle line:90%
they're interconnected.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:10%
How do you get them
to fail simultaneously

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.740 align:middle line:10%
so the core disappeared?

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.770 align:middle line:84%
It looks like those
core columns were cut.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:36.295 align:middle line:10%
>>The way we do this is by
cutting the beam at an angle.

00:51:36.295 --> 00:51:53.550 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:56.430 align:middle line:10%
>>I started looking
at the molten metal.

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:59.160 align:middle line:10%
All three buildings, both
towers, in the rubble,

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.950 align:middle line:10%
in the basement areas
and Building 7--

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.693 align:middle line:10%
there's these pools
of molten metal.

00:52:03.693 --> 00:52:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>You'd get down below and
you'd see molten steel--

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.549 align:middle line:84%
molten steel!-- running
down the channel rails,

00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:23.590 align:middle line:90%
like you're in a foundry.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Yep.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, like lava.

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Like it was lava--

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Like lava.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>--from a volcano.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>The molten steel
was found three, four,

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and five weeks later, when
the rubble was being removed.

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.190 align:middle line:84%
He said that molten
steel was also

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.377 align:middle line:84%
found underneath
World Trade Center 7.

00:52:37.377 --> 00:52:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking through
the official reports.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.880 align:middle line:84%
What do they say about
the molten metal?

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.566 align:middle line:90%
They say nothing.

00:52:43.566 --> 00:52:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, wait a minute.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.040 align:middle line:90%
This is important evidence.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.330 align:middle line:90%
So where'd that come from?

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.700 align:middle line:10%
>>Thermite is so hot
that it will just

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:58.080 align:middle line:10%
cut through steel, structural
steel for example, like a knife

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.340 align:middle line:10%
through butter.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>The products are molten
iron and aluminum oxide, which

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:07.350 align:middle line:90%
goes off primarily as a dust.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.557 align:middle line:84%
You know those
enormous dust clouds?

00:53:09.557 --> 00:53:11.640 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine, when you
assemble these chemicals

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.440 align:middle line:90%
on a large scale.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>So Professor Niels
Harrit, you examined

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the rubble that came from
the World Trade Center.

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.745 align:middle line:90%
What did you find in it?

00:53:23.745 --> 00:53:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, in there,
we find remains

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of what we characterize
as a thermitic material.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
energetic material,

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:84%
which can be used
either for melting iron

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:40.920 align:middle line:84%
or it can be designed
as an explosive.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.860 align:middle line:84%
The evidence for controlled
demolition is overwhelming.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I've told you that the thermite
reaction produced molten iron.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Molten iron was in
pools of molten iron

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.340 align:middle line:90%
under-- in the rubble.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And the point is that the
thermite kept on reacting.

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:00.650 align:middle line:84%
This was a Bitches' Brew
of thermite chemistry.

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:04.820 align:middle line:10%
>>Molten metal pools under both
towers after they collapsed

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.990 align:middle line:10%
and Building 7.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, Building 7 wasn't
even hit by a jet.

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Part of the problem is
that most people simply

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.640 align:middle line:84%
don't know much
about Building 7,

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.675 align:middle line:84%
due to the extraordinary secrecy
surrounding this collapse.

00:54:16.675 --> 00:54:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>And this was a
47-story skyscraper.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:23.960 align:middle line:90%
This building fell at 5:25.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>It was not hit by a plane.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:29.210 align:middle line:84%
This building had fires on
only two or three floors.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:32.110 align:middle line:10%
>>And it was brought
down by what we know

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:33.277 align:middle line:10%
was a controlled demolition.

00:54:33.277 --> 00:54:35.401 align:middle line:10%
>>Demolitions-- they look
just like that, you know,

00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:36.277 align:middle line:10%
a kink in the middle.

00:54:36.277 --> 00:54:38.610 align:middle line:10%
And then, that building just
comes straight down, almost

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:39.820 align:middle line:10%
at free-fall speed.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:55:49.820 align:middle line:90%


00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Our office was
on the B1 level.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:54.750 align:middle line:84%
As I was talking to a
supervisor, at 8:46--

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and all the sudden,
we hear, boom!

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:03.670 align:middle line:10%
--an explosion so hard
that it pushed us upwards.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And it came from the
basement, between the B2 level

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.246 align:middle line:90%
and the B3 level.

00:56:08.246 --> 00:56:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
verbalize, we hear, boom!

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.980 align:middle line:84%
--the impact of the
plane on the top.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>It would appear, Jim, as
that there's more smoke coming

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.340 align:middle line:90%
from the ground.

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.377 align:middle line:10%
>>I was down in the
basement, came down.

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:22.960 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden, the
elevator blew up.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>And as we were coming
out, we passed the lobby.

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:26.260 align:middle line:90%
There was no lobby.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.525 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that the
bomb hit the lobby first.

00:56:28.525 --> 00:56:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of seconds,
then, the first plane hit.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:32.983 align:middle line:10%
>>As I'm walking by the main
freight car of the building

00:56:32.983 --> 00:56:37.780 align:middle line:10%
in the corridor, that's--
that's when I got blown.

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the impact
of the explosion

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:41.755 align:middle line:90%
threw me to the floor.

00:56:41.755 --> 00:56:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's when everything
started happening.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:46.086 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, a big
impact happened again.

00:56:46.086 --> 00:56:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of the ceiling
tile was falling down.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.460 align:middle line:90%
The light fixtures were falling.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.080 align:middle line:10%
You know, you got to go clear
across the hole from One

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.960 align:middle line:10%
to Two World Trade Center.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
it happened all over again.

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Something else hit
us to the floor.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Right in the
basement, you felt it.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Walls were caving in.

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was
going on-- I mean,

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I know people that got
killed in the basement.

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I know people that got
broken legs in the basement.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.736 align:middle line:84%
People got
reconstructive surgery,

00:57:09.736 --> 00:57:11.360 align:middle line:84%
because the walls
hit them in the face.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:21.250 align:middle line:90%


00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>According to standard
operating procedure,

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:25.840 align:middle line:84%
if an FAA flight
controller notices anything

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.520 align:middle line:84%
that suggests a
possible hijacking,

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.572 align:middle line:84%

contact a superior.

00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:31.780 align:middle line:10%
If the problem cannot be
fixed within about a minute,

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:10%
the superior s to ask NORAD,
the North American Aerospace

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.150 align:middle line:10%
Command, to send up or scramble
jet fighters to find out what

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:39.020 align:middle line:10%
is going on.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.750 align:middle line:84%
NORAD then issues the scramble
order to the nearest Air Force

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Base with fighters on alert.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.320 align:middle line:10%
And although
interceptions usually

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.800 align:middle line:10%
occur within 10 or so
minutes, in this case,

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.820 align:middle line:10%
80 or so minutes had
elapsed before fighters

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.110 align:middle line:10%
were even airborne.

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:55.420 align:middle line:10%
>>It's a mind-bending anomaly.

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:57.980 align:middle line:10%
Not a single US Air
Force interceptor

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.230 align:middle line:10%
turns a wheel until
it's too late.

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.260 align:middle line:10%
There are no jets at all.

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>What if they were so confused
and had been so deliberately

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:08.650 align:middle line:84%
confused that they
couldn't respond?

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>The reason that they
didn't know where to go

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:15.080 align:middle line:84%
was because a number of
conflicting and overlapping war

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.280 align:middle line:84%
game exercises
were taking place.

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.710 align:middle line:84%
It involved the insertion
of false radar blips

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.414 align:middle line:84%
on the radar screens in the
Northeast Air Defense sector.

00:58:23.414 --> 00:58:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>...Center TMU.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We have a problem here.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.840 align:middle line:84%
We have a hijacked aircraft
headed towards New York.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We need someone to scramble
some F-16s or something up there

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.750 align:middle line:90%
to help us out.

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Is this-- is this
real-world or exercise?

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Is this real-world or exercise?

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.250 align:middle line:10%
>>There was another
exercise, Vigilant Warrior,

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.690 align:middle line:10%
which was in fact,
according to a NORAD source,

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:45.482 align:middle line:10%
a live-fly hijack drill being
conducted at the same time.

00:58:45.482 --> 00:58:47.690 align:middle line:84%
With only eight available
fighter aircraft-- and they

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.940 align:middle line:84%
have to be dispatched
in pairs-- they

00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.130 align:middle line:84%
were dealing with as many
as 22 possible hijacks

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.610 align:middle line:90%
on the day of 9/11.

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't separate
the war game exercises

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.710 align:middle line:90%
from the actual hijacks.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:23.860 align:middle line:90%


00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Page 172-- the US
government has not

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.050 align:middle line:90%
for the 9/11 attacks.

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the question is of
little practical significance.

>>The American
authorities have not

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.970 align:middle line:10%
managed to trace the
source of the funding.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:42.410 align:middle line:10%
And then, the most amazingly
disingenuous statement--

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:44.850 align:middle line:10%
ultimately, it is of
little consequence.

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It is of massive consequence.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Doesn't it matter
who paid for 9/11?

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.830 align:middle line:10%
>>The collapse of Building 7 has
been recognized as especially

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.140 align:middle line:10%
difficult to explain.

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:57.510 align:middle line:10%
The 9/11 Commission
Report implicitly

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:59.400 align:middle line:10%
admitted that it
could not explain

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.106 align:middle line:10%
the collapse of this building
by not even mentioning it.

01:00:02.106 --> 01:00:02.906 align:middle line:10%
>>Next.

01:00:02.906 --> 01:00:05.670 align:middle line:10%
>>President, why are you and
the Vice President insisting

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:08.120 align:middle line:10%
on appearing together
before the 9/11 Commission?

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.199 align:middle line:10%
>>Because the 9/11 Commission
wants to ask us questions.

01:00:11.199 --> 01:00:12.240 align:middle line:10%
That's why we're meeting.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.640 align:middle line:10%
And I look forward
to meeting with them

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.030 align:middle line:10%
and answering their questions.

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:16.530 align:middle line:10%
>>Sorry, Mr.
President, I was asking

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.840 align:middle line:10%
why you're appearing together,
rather than separately,

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.410 align:middle line:10%
which was their request?

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.700 align:middle line:10%
>>Because it's a good chance
for both of us to answer

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.890 align:middle line:10%
questions that the 9/11
Commission is looking forward

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.720 align:middle line:10%
to asking us.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.030 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking forward
to answering them.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
Let's see--

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:34.590 align:middle line:10%
>>Do you think they should
be able to stand up and speak

01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:35.400 align:middle line:10%
their own words?

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>They should go under oath.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>They should be-- yeah.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:37.920 align:middle line:90%

me that question yesterday.

01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:59.000 align:middle line:90%

Yeah.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>The final report was
a unanimous report.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.210 align:middle line:84%
That means that if there was
a single commissioner who

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
had any objection
about anything,

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%

dropped from the report.

a draft memo for the
setup of the Bush

strategy that was eventually
used for the war in Iraq,

did not approve of.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>We can understand,
therefore, why

the commission, under
Zelikow's leadership

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
would have ignored
all the evidence that

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
would point to the
truth, that 9/11

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%

01:13:58.874 --> 01:14:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and the expansion and
contraction of the money

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
supply itself.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.716 align:middle line:84%
Now, the central
bank does not simply

01:14:04.716 --> 01:14:05.965 align:middle line:90%
issue money to the government.

01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:08.900 align:middle line:10%
It loans it to
them with interest.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Then, through the mechanisms
of increasing and decreasing

01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
the supply of money,
the central bank

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
essentially regulates the
value of the currency issued.

01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It is critical to understand
that the entire structure

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of this system could
only produce one

01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:26.674 align:middle line:90%
thing in the long run-- debt.

01:14:26.674 --> 01:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take a
lot of ingenuity

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.530 align:middle line:90%
to figure this scam out.

01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
For every single dollar
produced by both the

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Central Bank and its
regulated commercial banks

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.700 align:middle line:90%
is loaned at interest.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
That means every $1
produced is actually

01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
$1 plus a certain percentage
of debt based on that $1.

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And since the banking
system have the monopoly

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:49.750 align:middle line:84%
of the production of the
currency and they loan each

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
$1 out with an
immediate debt attached

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to it, where does the money
to pay for the debt come from?

01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.620 align:middle line:10%
It can only come from
the banks again, which

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.890 align:middle line:10%
means the banking system has to
perpetually increase its money

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:07.090 align:middle line:10%
supply to temporarily cover
the outstanding debt created,

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.360 align:middle line:10%
which in turn-- since that
new money is loaned out

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.900 align:middle line:10%
at interest as well--
creates even more debt.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.010 align:middle line:84%
The end result of this system
is, essentially, slavery.

01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
For it is technically impossible
for the government and, thus,

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
the public to ever come out
of this self-generating debt.

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:55.300 align:middle line:90%


01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
By the early 20th
century, the US

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
had already implemented and
removed a few central banking

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
systems which were
maneuvered into place

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.710 align:middle line:90%
by ruthless banking interests.

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.680 align:middle line:10%
At this time, the
dominant families

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.170 align:middle line:10%
in the banking
and business world

01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:11.480 align:middle line:10%
were the Rockefellers,
the Morgans, the Warburgs,

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.090 align:middle line:10%
the Rothschilds.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:16.420 align:middle line:10%
And in the early 1900s, they
sought to push, once again,

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.630 align:middle line:10%
legislation to create
another central bank.

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:22.880 align:middle line:84%
However, they knew the
government and public were very

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.920 align:middle line:90%
weary of such an institution.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So they needed to
create an incident

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:29.340 align:middle line:90%
to affect public opinion.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So J.P. Morgan, publicly
considered a financial luminary

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
at the time, exploited his
massive influence by reportedly

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
creating rumors that
prominent banks in New York

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.150 align:middle line:90%
were insolvent or bankrupt.

01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Morgan knew this would
trigger mass hysteria

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.170 align:middle line:90%
and a systemic crisis.

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:46.800 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
The public, in fear of
losing their deposits,

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
immediately began
mass withdrawals.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, the banks were
forced to call in their loans,

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
causing the recipients
to sell their property.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And thus, a spiral of
bankruptcies, repossessions,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
and turmoil emerged.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.990 align:middle line:10%
Putting the pieces
together years later,

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:07.340 align:middle line:10%
Congressman Charles Lindberg
wrote, "The king bankers

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.210 align:middle line:10%
put in motion in
1907 a great scheme.

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:12.350 align:middle line:10%
They had gambled and
speculated on Wall Street

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:16.130 align:middle line:10%
until so many watered stocks
and bonds had been manufactured.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.710 align:middle line:10%
The king bankers
knew the condition

01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:20.920 align:middle line:10%
and informed the favorite of
their friends what was to come.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.610 align:middle line:10%
There was to be a panic
in the fall of 1907.

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:26.800 align:middle line:10%
And it would be advertised as
the result of our bad banking

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.360 align:middle line:10%
and currency laws."

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.780 align:middle line:10%
The panic of 1907 led to a
Congressional investigation,

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.150 align:middle line:10%
headed by Senator
Nelson Aldrich, who

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.820 align:middle line:10%
had intimate ties to
the financial powers

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.940 align:middle line:10%
and, later, became part
of the Rockefeller family

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.240 align:middle line:10%
through marriage.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.210 align:middle line:10%
The commission led by
Aldrich recommended

01:17:43.210 --> 01:17:45.530 align:middle line:10%
a central bank
should be implemented

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:49.420 align:middle line:10%
so a panic like 1907
could never happen again.

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
This was the spark
that the bankers

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.150 align:middle line:90%
needed to initiate their plan.

01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:56.510 align:middle line:10%
And in 1910, a secret meeting
was held at a J.P. Morgan

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:59.739 align:middle line:10%
estate on Jekyll Island
off the coast of Georgia.

01:17:59.739 --> 01:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
It was there that
the central banking

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
bill, called the Federal
Reserve Act, was written.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
This legislation was written
by bankers, not law-makers.

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
This meeting was so
secretive, so concealed

01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
from government and
public knowledge,

01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:14.590 align:middle line:84%
that most of the
figures who attended

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
disguised their names when
en route to the island.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And after this bill
was constructed,

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
it was then handed over
to their political front

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
man, Senator Nelson Aldrich,
to push through Congress.

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.920 align:middle line:10%
And in 1913, with heavy
political sponsorship

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.250 align:middle line:10%
by the bankers, Woodrow
Wilson became President,

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:33.770 align:middle line:10%
having already agreed to
sign the Federal Reserve

01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:36.560 align:middle line:10%
Act in exchange for
campaign support.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And a few days before
Christmas, when much of Congress

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
was at home with their families,
the Federal Reserve Act

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:42.730 align:middle line:90%
was voted in.

01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And Wilson, in
turn, made it law.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.530 align:middle line:84%
The night before its passage,
Congressman Charles Lindberg

01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
pleaded, "This act establishes
the most gigantic trust

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:52.970 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
When the President
signs this act,

01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
the invisible government by the
money power will be legalized."

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the public was told that
the Federal Reserve System was

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
an economic stabilizer
and inflation

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and economic crises were
a thing of the past.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, as history
has shown, nothing

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:12.270 align:middle line:90%
was further from the truth.

01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, the bankers now
had a streamlined machine

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.360 align:middle line:90%
for economic manipulation.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>It's alive.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It's alive.

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:22.390 align:middle line:90%
It's alive!

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>For example,
from 1914 to 1919,

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
the Fed substantially
increased the money supply,

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.980 align:middle line:84%
resulting in extensive loans
to small banks and the public.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Then, in 1920, the
Fed deliberately

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
contracted credit
in an extreme way,

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
thus resulting in
banks having to call

01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:40.060 align:middle line:90%
in large numbers of loans.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And just like 1907,
bank runs, bankruptcy,

01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
and systemic collapse occurred.

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Numerous competitive banks
outside of the Federal Reserve

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.880 align:middle line:10%
System collapsed, further
consolidating the monopoly

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.040 align:middle line:10%
of the money trust cartel.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.260 align:middle line:90%


01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.760 align:middle line:10%
Privy to this scheme,
Congressman Lindberg

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.550 align:middle line:10%
pronounced, "Under the
Federal Reserve Act,

01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:03.640 align:middle line:10%
panics are
scientifically created.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.820 align:middle line:10%
The present panic is the first
scientifically created one,

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:11.000 align:middle line:10%
worked out as we figure
a mathematical equation."

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
However, the panic of
1920 was just a warm up.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:19.130 align:middle line:84%
From 1921 to 1929, the Fed again
increased the money supply,

01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
resulting once again
in extensive loans

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%
to the public and banks.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
There was also a fairly new type
of loan in the stock market,

01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:28.310 align:middle line:90%
the broker call loan.

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Very simply, this loan
allowed an investor

01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to put down only a fraction
of the stock's value,

01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
with the rest being a
loan from the broker.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.930 align:middle line:84%
This method was very popular
in the Roaring 1920s,

01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
as everyone seemed to be
making money in the market.

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:43.880 align:middle line:10%
However, there was a
catch to this loan.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It could be called
in at any time

01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and had to be paid
within 24 hours.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And the typical
result was the selling

01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.480 align:middle line:84%
of the stock purchased
with that loan.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So a few months before October
in 1929, JD Rockefeller,

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Bernard Baruch, and
many other insiders

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
quietly exited the market,
knowing the bubble created

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.390 align:middle line:90%
was about to burst.

01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:08.090 align:middle line:10%
Then, on October 24,
1929, the financiers

01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:09.800 align:middle line:10%
who furnished the
call loans started

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.780 align:middle line:10%
calling them in en masse.

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.420 align:middle line:84%
This sparked and
instantaneous massive sell-off

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
in the already inflated market
as sell orders and margin calls

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.320 align:middle line:90%
were systemically triggered.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.410 align:middle line:84%
That then led to mass bank
runs, eventually collapsing

01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
thousands of banks,
enabling the large banks

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
to buy up the now-failed
banks at a discount.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.950 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't stop there.

01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Rather than expanding
the money supply in order

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to recover from this
economic collapse,

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
the Fed actually
contracted it, fueling

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the largest depressions
in American history.

01:21:42.170 --> 01:21:45.110 align:middle line:90%


01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:47.150 align:middle line:10%
Outraged, Congressman
Lewis McFadden,

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:49.750 align:middle line:10%
then-Chairman of the
House Banking Committee,

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:52.310 align:middle line:10%
petitioned for impeachment
against the Federal Reserve

01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:56.840 align:middle line:10%
Board stating, "Mr. Chairman,
we have in this country

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.490 align:middle line:10%
one of the most
corrupt institutions

01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:59.960 align:middle line:10%
the world has ever known.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.870 align:middle line:10%
I refer to the Federal Reserve
Board and the Federal Reserve

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:04.280 align:middle line:10%
banks.

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.680 align:middle line:10%
This evil institution has
impoverished and ruined

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.170 align:middle line:10%
the people of the United
States and has practically

01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:10.770 align:middle line:10%
bankrupted our government.

01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:12.800 align:middle line:10%
It has done this
through the defects

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.960 align:middle line:10%
of the law under
which it operates,

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.810 align:middle line:10%
through the maladministration of
that law by the Federal Reserve

01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:20.210 align:middle line:10%
Board, and through
the corrupt practices

01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:24.020 align:middle line:10%
of the moneyed vultures
who control it."

01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, having reduced
the society to squalor,

01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:28.670 align:middle line:84%
it was then decided
that the gold standard

01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:29.960 align:middle line:90%
should be removed.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
In order to do this, they
needed to acquire the remaining

01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:33.990 align:middle line:90%
gold in the system.

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So under the pretense of
helping to end the depression,

01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:40.220 align:middle line:90%
came the 1933 gold seizure.

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Under the threat of
imprisonment for 10 years,

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.010 align:middle line:84%
everyone in America was required
to turn in all gold Bullion

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Treasury, essentially
robbing the public of what

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:50.800 align:middle line:90%
little wealth they had left.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.200 align:middle line:10%
And at the end of 1933, the
gold standard was abolished.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.750 align:middle line:10%
If you looked at a
$1 bill before 1933,

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:59.130 align:middle line:10%
it says it is
redeemable in gold.

01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the $1 bill today,

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.750 align:middle line:84%
it says it is
legal tender, which

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
means it is backed by
absolutely nothing.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.490 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
gives our money value

01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
is the public faith and how
much of it is in circulation.

01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:14.090 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, the power to
regulate the money supply

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:16.880 align:middle line:10%
is also the power to
regulate its value, which

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.620 align:middle line:10%
is also the power to manipulate
and control entire economies.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:29.270 align:middle line:90%


01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It is important to
clearly understand,

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve is
a private corporation.

01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It is about as federal
as Federal Express.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It makes its own policies and
is under little regulation

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.850 align:middle line:90%
by the US government.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.900 align:middle line:84%
It is a private bank that loans
all the currency at interest

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
to the government,
completely consistent

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
with the central banking
model that the country

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:52.460 align:middle line:84%
sought to escape from when
it declared independence

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
in the American
Revolutionary War.

01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, going back to 1913,
the Federal Reserve Act

01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.290 align:middle line:84%
was not the only bill
pushed through Congress

01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
for the vested
financial interests.

01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
They also pushed its partner,
the Federal Income Tax.

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:08.430 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
federal income tax

01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
is completely
unconstitutional, as it

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:13.130 align:middle line:90%
is a direct unapportioned tax.

01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And the required number
of states needed in order

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
to ratify the amendment
to allow the income tax

01:24:18.710 --> 01:24:20.480 align:middle line:90%
was never legally met.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And this has even been
cited in modern court cases.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:33.500 align:middle line:90%


01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Second, at the present
day, roughly 25%

01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
of the average
worker's income is

01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:39.860 align:middle line:90%
taken from them via this tax.

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
That means, you work three
months out of the year

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:44.210 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill this tax obligation.

01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And where does that money go?

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
According to the Grace
Commission Report of the 1980s,

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
"100% of what is collected is
absorbed solely by interest

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:55.190 align:middle line:84%
on the federal debt and
by federal government

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:57.750 align:middle line:84%
contributions to
transfer payments.

01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:00.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, all
individual income tax revenues

01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:02.270 align:middle line:84%
are gone before
one nickel is spent

01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
on the services which taxpayers
expect from their government."

01:25:06.170 --> 01:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, the money Americans
make working three months out

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of the year goes almost entirely
to the interest fees charged

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
for the debt-based
fiat currency.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, the
federal income tax

01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
exists to feed the Federal
Reserve, federal government,

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:25.040 align:middle line:84%
money machine, making sure the
interest payments are always

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.090 align:middle line:90%
there.

01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And third, even
with the government

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
claim as to the legality
of the income tax,

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
there is still evidently no
statute, no law in existence,

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that requires you
to pay this tax.

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I really expected
that, of course,

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.060 align:middle line:84%
there's a law that you can point
to in the law book, a code that

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
requires you to
file a tax return.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Of course there is.

01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:50.090 align:middle line:10%
I was at that point where I
couldn't find a statute that

01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:53.360 align:middle line:10%
clearly made a person
liable, at least

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.030 align:middle line:10%
not me and most people I know.

01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:59.660 align:middle line:10%
And I had no choice in
my mind except to resign.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:02.930 align:middle line:10%
>>Based on the research that
I did throughout the year 2000

01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:05.445 align:middle line:10%
and that I'm still doing,
I have not found that law.

01:26:05.445 --> 01:26:06.860 align:middle line:10%
I've asked Congress.

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.640 align:middle line:10%
We've asked a lot of people in
the IRS, the IRS commissioner's

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:10.440 align:middle line:10%
helpers.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.820 align:middle line:10%
They can't answer.

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.654 align:middle line:10%
Because if they answer,
the American people

01:26:13.654 --> 01:26:16.910 align:middle line:10%
are going to know that this
whole thing is a fraud.

01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>I haven't filed a federal
income tax return since I left.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>I have not filed a
tax return since 1999.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, the control of the
economy and the manipulation

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.140 align:middle line:84%
of society for the
vested financial powers

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
is only a part of the
game being played.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Another level is
the business of war.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Since the inception of the
Federal Reserve in 1913,

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.250 align:middle line:84%
a number of large and
small wars have commenced.

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
The three most pronounced might
be World War I, World War II,

01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and Vietnam.

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
World War I-- in
1914, European wars

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
broke out centered around
England and Germany.

01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The American public wanted
nothing to do with the war.

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
In turn, President
Woodrow Wilson

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.460 align:middle line:90%
publicly declared neutrality.

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
However, under the
surface, evidence now

01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
shows that the financial powers
behind the administration

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
were looking for any excuse
it could to enter in.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
It is important to
understand that one

01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of the most lucrative things
that can happen for the bankers

01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:13.650 align:middle line:90%
is war.

01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:16.670 align:middle line:84%
For it forces the country
to borrow even more money

01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
at interest, not to mention
the prophets generated

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:22.540 align:middle line:84%
through the financing
of military production.

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.490 align:middle line:10%
In the words of two-time
Congressional Medal

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:28.390 align:middle line:10%
of Honor winner Smedley
Butler, "War is a racket.

01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:29.810 align:middle line:10%
It always has been.

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:33.010 align:middle line:10%
It is possibly the oldest,
easily the most profitable,

01:27:33.010 --> 01:27:34.215 align:middle line:10%
surely the most vicious.

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:36.830 align:middle line:10%
It is the only one
international in scope.

01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:38.710 align:middle line:10%
And it is the only one
in which the profits

01:27:38.710 --> 01:27:42.730 align:middle line:10%
are reckoned in dollars
and the losses in lives."

01:27:42.730 --> 01:27:44.965 align:middle line:10%
Woodrow Wilson's top
adviser and mentor

01:27:44.965 --> 01:27:47.770 align:middle line:10%
was Colonel Edward
House, a man found

01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:50.270 align:middle line:10%
to have intimate connections
with the financial interests

01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:51.290 align:middle line:10%
of the time.

01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:54.370 align:middle line:10%
In a conversation with Colonel
House, Wilson's adviser,

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:57.710 align:middle line:10%
and Sir Edward Grey, the foreign
secretary of England, regarding

01:27:57.710 --> 01:28:00.620 align:middle line:10%
America and the
war, Grey inquired,

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.950 align:middle line:10%
what will America do if
Germans sink an ocean

01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:05.410 align:middle line:10%
liner with American
passengers on board?

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:08.390 align:middle line:10%
House responded, I believe
that a flame of indignation

01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:09.640 align:middle line:10%
would sweep the United States.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.480 align:middle line:10%
And that by itself would
be sufficient to carry us

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.720 align:middle line:10%
into war.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:17.620 align:middle line:10%
So on May 7, 1915, a
ship called the Lusitania

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:21.160 align:middle line:10%
was sent where German military
vessels were known to be.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.590 align:middle line:10%
And as likely expected,
German U-boats

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:26.980 align:middle line:10%
torpedoed the ship,
exploding stored munitions,

01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:29.680 align:middle line:10%
killing 1,200 people.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.910 align:middle line:10%
To further understand
the obvious anticipation

01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:34.420 align:middle line:10%
of this set-up, the
German embassy actually

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:37.090 align:middle line:10%
put advertisements in
"The New York Times"

01:28:37.090 --> 01:28:39.340 align:middle line:10%
telling people that, if
they boarded the Lusitania,

01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:42.250 align:middle line:10%
they did so at their own
risk, as such a ship sailing

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.470 align:middle line:10%
from America to England
through the war zone

01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:46.600 align:middle line:10%
would be liable to destruction.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.810 align:middle line:10%
In turn and as anticipated,
the sinking of the Lusitania

01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:53.180 align:middle line:10%
caused a wave of anger among
the American population.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And America entered the
war a short time after.

01:28:57.370 --> 01:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Major General Smedley Butler
summarizes the monetary reality

01:29:01.040 --> 01:30:00.080 align:middle line:90%
of World War I.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.950 align:middle line:84%
World War II-- on
December 7, 1941,

01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Japan attacked the American
fleet at Pearl Harbor,

01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:08.980 align:middle line:84%
triggering US entry
into that war.

01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:11.000 align:middle line:10%
President Franklin
D. Roosevelt declared

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.730 align:middle line:10%
the attack was a day
that will live in infamy.

01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:17.890 align:middle line:84%
A day of infamy indeed, but not
because of the alleged surprise

01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:19.580 align:middle line:90%
attack on Pearl Harbor.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
After 60 years of
surfacing information,

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
it is now clear that not only
was the attack known well

01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
in advance, it was outright
wanted and provoked.

01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:31.370 align:middle line:10%
In a journal entry by
Roosevelt's Secretary of War,

01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:34.930 align:middle line:10%
Henry Stimson, dated
November 25, 1941,

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.800 align:middle line:10%
he documented a
conversation he had

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.630 align:middle line:10%
with Roosevelt. The question
was how we should maneuver them

01:30:40.630 --> 01:30:42.670 align:middle line:10%
into firing the first shot.

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And in congressional
testimony later, he added,

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:48.130 align:middle line:10%
"It was desirable to make sure
the Japanese were the ones

01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:50.950 align:middle line:10%
to do this so that there
should remain no doubt as

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:53.000 align:middle line:10%
to who were the aggressors."

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.580 align:middle line:84%
In the months leading up to
the attack on Pearl Harbor,

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt had done
almost everything

01:30:57.190 --> 01:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
in his power to
anger the Japanese,

01:30:59.050 --> 01:31:00.830 align:middle line:90%
showing a posture of aggression.

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:03.790 align:middle line:84%
He halted all of Japan's
imports of American petroleum.

01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
He froze all Japanese
assets in the United States.

01:31:06.730 --> 01:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
He made public loans
to nationalist China

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and supplied military aid to the
British, both enemies of Japan

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:13.220 align:middle line:90%
in the war.

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Which, by the way, was
in complete violation

01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:17.120 align:middle line:90%
of international war rules.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And with numerous Japanese
codes broken in advance

01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:23.900 align:middle line:84%
revealing the plan to
attack, on December 7, 1941,

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Japan was allowed to
attack Pearl Harbor,

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:29.120 align:middle line:90%
killing 2,400 soldiers.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Before Pearl Harbor, 83%
of the American public

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.480 align:middle line:84%
wanted nothing to
do with the war.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.162 align:middle line:84%
After Pearl Harbor, one
million men volunteered.

01:31:37.162 --> 01:31:41.830 align:middle line:90%


01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:44.870 align:middle line:84%
It is important to note Nazi
Germany's war effort was

01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:47.960 align:middle line:84%
largely supported by two
organizations, one of which

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.505 align:middle line:90%
was called IG Farben.

01:31:49.505 --> 01:31:53.290 align:middle line:84%
IG Farben produced 84%
of Germany's explosives.

01:31:53.290 --> 01:31:56.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the unspoken
partners of IG Farben

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.750 align:middle line:84%
was J.D Rockefeller's Standard
Oil Company in America.

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:01.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the German
Air Force could not

01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:04.250 align:middle line:84%
operate without a
special additive patented

01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:06.370 align:middle line:90%
by Rockefeller's Standard Oil.

01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:09.600 align:middle line:84%
The drastic bombing of London
by Nazi Germany, for example,

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.430 align:middle line:84%
was made possible by a
$20 million sale of fuel

01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:15.320 align:middle line:84%
to IG Farben by the
Rockefeller's Standard Oil

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Company.

01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
This is just one small point
on the topic of how American

01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:22.680 align:middle line:84%
business funded both
sides of World War II.

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.260 align:middle line:84%
One other treasonous
organization worth mentioning

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
is the Union Banking
Corporation of New York City.

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:30.420 align:middle line:10%
Not only did they
finance numerous aspects

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:33.230 align:middle line:10%
of Hitler's rise to power
along with actual materials

01:32:33.230 --> 01:32:37.050 align:middle line:10%
during the war, it was also
a Nazi money-laundering bank,

01:32:37.050 --> 01:32:39.890 align:middle line:10%
which was eventually exposed
for having millions of dollars

01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:42.090 align:middle line:10%
of Nazi money and its vaults.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The Union Banking
Corporation of New York

01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:46.950 align:middle line:84%
was eventually seized for
violations of the Trading

01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:48.420 align:middle line:90%
with the Enemy Act.

01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Guess who the director and Vice
President of the Union Bank

01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:51.980 align:middle line:90%
was?

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Prescott Bush, the
father and grandfather

01:32:55.020 --> 01:33:01.050 align:middle line:84%
of former US Presidents George
W. Bush and George H.W. Bush.

01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Vietnam-- the United
States' official escalation

01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and entry into the Vietnam War
came after an alleged incident

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.660 align:middle line:84%
involving two US
destroyers being

01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:13.920 align:middle line:84%
attacked by North Vietnamese
PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.590 align:middle line:10%
This is known as the
Gulf of Tonkin Incident.

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:19.170 align:middle line:84%
This situation was
the catalystic pretext

01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:23.340 align:middle line:84%
for massive troop deployment
and full-fledged warfare.

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:25.860 align:middle line:84%
One problem however--
the attack on the US

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:29.880 align:middle line:84%
destroyers by Vietnamese
PT boats never happened.

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Former Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara stated years

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.630 align:middle line:84%
later that the Gulf of Tonkin
Incident was a mistake,

01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:39.240 align:middle line:84%
while classified documents
released years later,

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.340 align:middle line:84%
showed that it was
a farce, manipulated

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.550 align:middle line:90%
for the purposes of war.

01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And once in the war, it
was business as usual.

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.950 align:middle line:84%
In October 1966,
President Lyndon Johnson

01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:52.430 align:middle line:84%
lifted trade restrictions
on the Soviet bloc,

01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:54.300 align:middle line:84%
knowing full well
that the Soviets were

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:58.470 align:middle line:84%
providing upwards of 80% of
North Vietnam's war supplies.

01:33:58.470 --> 01:34:00.690 align:middle line:10%
Consequently, the
Rockefeller interests

01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:04.080 align:middle line:10%
financed factories in the Soviet
Union, which the Soviets used

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.090 align:middle line:10%
to manufacture
military equipment

01:34:06.090 --> 01:34:08.230 align:middle line:10%
and send to North Vietnam.

01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
However, the funding of
both sides in this conflict

01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:12.800 align:middle line:90%
was only one side of the coin.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.390 align:middle line:84%
In 1985, Vietnam's Rules of
Engagement were declassified.

01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
This detailed what American
troops were and were not

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.680 align:middle line:90%
allowed to do in the war.

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.750 align:middle line:84%
It included such absurdities as
North Vietnamese anti-aircraft

01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:27.000 align:middle line:84%
missile systems could
not be bombed until they

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.880 align:middle line:90%
were known to be operational.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.990 align:middle line:84%
No enemy could be
pursued once they crossed

01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:33.040 align:middle line:90%
the border of Laos or Cambodia.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And most revealing of all, the
most critical strategic targets

01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:39.020 align:middle line:84%
were not allowed to be
attacked unless initiated

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.300 align:middle line:90%
via high military officials.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Apart from these
illogical limitations,

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.260 align:middle line:84%
North Vietnam was informed
of these restrictions

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, could
base entire strategies

01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:51.300 align:middle line:84%
around the limitations
of the American forces.

01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
This is why the war
went on for so long.

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:56.850 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is this, the
Vietnam War was never meant

01:34:56.850 --> 01:34:59.790 align:middle line:90%
to be won, just sustained.

01:34:59.790 --> 01:35:01.650 align:middle line:10%
This war for profit
and resources

01:35:01.650 --> 01:35:04.430 align:middle line:10%
resulted in 58,000
American deaths

01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:05.957 align:middle line:10%
and 3 million dead Vietnamese.

01:35:05.957 --> 01:35:09.090 align:middle line:90%


01:35:09.090 --> 01:35:11.940 align:middle line:90%
So where are we now?

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:15.440 align:middle line:10%
September 11 was the jumpstart
for a hegemonic agenda,

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.050 align:middle line:10%
enabling the possibility
of constant global warfare.

01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:22.190 align:middle line:10%
It was a staged war pretext,
no different than the sinking

01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:24.960 align:middle line:10%
of the Lusitania, the
provoking of Pearl Harbor,

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.170 align:middle line:10%
and the Gulf of Tonkin lie.

01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:30.440 align:middle line:10%
In fact, if 9/11 wasn't
a planned war pretext,

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.300 align:middle line:10%
it would be an
exception to the rule.

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.730 align:middle line:10%
It has been used to launch two
unprovoked illegal wars, one

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:38.490 align:middle line:10%
against Iraq and the
other against Afghanistan.

01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:42.120 align:middle line:84%
However, 9/11 was a pretext
for another war as well,

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.420 align:middle line:90%
the war against you.

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.430 align:middle line:84%
The Patriot Act,
Homeland Security,

01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:49.170 align:middle line:84%
the Military Tribunals
Act, and other legislations

01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:52.710 align:middle line:84%
are all completely designed to
destroy your civil liberties

01:35:52.710 --> 01:35:55.290 align:middle line:90%
and protect those in power.

01:35:55.290 --> 01:35:58.640 align:middle line:10%
Currently in the United States,
unannounced to most Americans,

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.010 align:middle line:10%
your home can be searched
without a warrant,

01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:02.940 align:middle line:10%
without you being home.

01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.920 align:middle line:10%
You can, in turn, be
detained indefinitely,

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.760 align:middle line:10%
with no charges revealed to
you, no access to a lawyer,

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.470 align:middle line:10%
and legally tortured.

01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:15.010 align:middle line:10%
All under the suspicion that
you might be a terrorist.

01:36:15.010 --> 01:36:17.180 align:middle line:84%
If you need a painted
picture of what is happening,

01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:20.760 align:middle line:84%
let's recognize how
history repeats itself.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.920 align:middle line:84%
In February 1933, Hitler
staged a false flag attack,

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.700 align:middle line:84%
burning down his own
German parliament

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.950 align:middle line:84%
building, the Reichstag, blaming
it on Communist terrorists.

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:33.170 align:middle line:90%


01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Within the next few weeks,
he passed the Enabling Act,

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:38.750 align:middle line:84%
which completely eradicated
the German constitution,

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:41.090 align:middle line:90%
destroying people's liberties.

01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:43.270 align:middle line:10%
He then led a series
of preemptive wars,

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:47.250 align:middle line:10%
all justified as necessary to
maintaining homeland security.

01:36:47.250 --> 01:37:12.458 align:middle line:90%


01:37:12.458 --> 01:37:14.426 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING GERMAN]

01:37:14.426 --> 01:37:22.340 align:middle line:90%


01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Our enemy is a radical
network of terrorists

01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and every government
that supports them.

01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>It's time to wake up.

01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:33.870 align:middle line:10%
The people in power
go out of their way

01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:38.170 align:middle line:10%
to make sure you are perpetually
misled and manipulated.

01:37:38.170 --> 01:37:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The majority's
perception of reality,

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:43.580 align:middle line:84%
especially in the political
arena, is not their own.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It is shrewdly imposed upon them
without them even knowing it.

01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:49.550 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
public at large now

01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:52.160 align:middle line:84%
believes the invasions of
Iraq and the Middle East,

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.350 align:middle line:84%
along with the
resulting instability,

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:56.570 align:middle line:84%
are the consequences of
political and military

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.000 align:middle line:90%
mistakes.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.840 align:middle line:84%
What the public fails
to see, of course,

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is that the destabilization
of the Middle East

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what the
Western interests want.

01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:09.020 align:middle line:10%
This war is to be sustained so
the region can be divided up,

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.090 align:middle line:10%
domination of the
oil maintained,

01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:14.150 align:middle line:10%
continual profits reaped
for defense contractors,

01:38:14.150 --> 01:38:16.790 align:middle line:10%
and most obviously,
permanent military bases

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:18.890 align:middle line:10%
established to be
used as launching

01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:23.000 align:middle line:10%
pads against other oil-bearing
nonconforming countries,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.220 align:middle line:10%
such as Iran.

01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.490 align:middle line:10%
For further implication that the
civil war and destabilization

01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:33.320 align:middle line:10%
is purely intentional, in 2005,
two elite British SAS officers

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.290 align:middle line:10%
were arrested by Iraqi
police after being caught

01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:39.680 align:middle line:10%
driving around in their
car, shooting at civilians,

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.840 align:middle line:10%
while dressed up as Arabs.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.720 align:middle line:10%
After being arrested and
taken to a jail in Basra,

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:48.230 align:middle line:10%
the British Army immediately
demanded release of these men.

01:38:48.230 --> 01:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
When the Basra
government refused,

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:53.750 align:middle line:84%
British tanks came in and
physically broke out the men

01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:55.220 align:middle line:90%
from the Basra prison.

01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:59.279 align:middle line:84%
>>If you wish to destroy
an area, how do you do it?

01:38:59.279 --> 01:39:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, there are two ways.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.350 align:middle line:10%
You can go in there and
bomb it and so forth.

01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:03.782 align:middle line:10%
But that is not very efficient.

01:39:03.782 --> 01:39:05.990 align:middle line:10%
What you do is you try to
get the people in that area

01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:09.650 align:middle line:10%
to kill each other and to
destroy their own territory,

01:39:09.650 --> 01:39:11.240 align:middle line:10%
their own farms.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's been
done in that area.

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:16.640 align:middle line:84%
The way in which you
destroy an opponent

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
is get him to destroy himself by
dividing his ranks against one

01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:21.170 align:middle line:90%
another.

01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Then, you feel both sides.

01:39:22.730 --> 01:39:26.000 align:middle line:84%
You have agents feeding both
sides, inflaming both sides.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And they kill each other off.

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.630 align:middle line:10%
And it is time that some of
us woke up to this reality,

01:39:32.630 --> 01:39:35.240 align:middle line:10%
to understand that
people who try

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.540 align:middle line:10%
to maintain empires
and create empires

01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:43.790 align:middle line:10%
do it by manipulating the people
they're trying to conquer.

01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:46.400 align:middle line:10%
>>You might want to ask yourself
why the entire culture's

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.100 align:middle line:10%
utterly saturated with
mass media entertainment

01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:52.670 align:middle line:10%
from all sides, while the
educational system in America

01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:56.300 align:middle line:10%
continues its stupefying
downward slide, since the US

01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:59.900 align:middle line:10%
government decided to take over
and subsidize the public school

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:02.790 align:middle line:10%
system.

01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>What your government
pays for, it gets.

01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:09.410 align:middle line:10%
When we understand
that, then we look

01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:13.790 align:middle line:10%
at government-financed
institutions of education

01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:16.850 align:middle line:10%
and see the kind of students
and the kind of education

01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:21.030 align:middle line:10%
that's being turned out by these
government-financed schools.

01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Logic will tell you that,
if what is being turned out

01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:27.740 align:middle line:84%
in those schools was
not in accord with what

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the state and the federal
government wanted,

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.500 align:middle line:90%
then it would change it.

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.390 align:middle line:10%
The bottom line is
that the government is

01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:38.120 align:middle line:10%
getting what they have ordered.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:43.920 align:middle line:10%
They do not want your
children to be educated.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.750 align:middle line:10%
They do not want you
to think too much.

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.180 align:middle line:10%
That is why our
country and our world

01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:55.370 align:middle line:10%
has become so proliferated with
entertainments, mass media,

01:40:55.370 --> 01:41:00.650 align:middle line:10%
television shows, amusement
parks, drugs, alcohol,

01:41:00.650 --> 01:41:02.930 align:middle line:10%
and every kind of
entertainment to keep

01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:06.470 align:middle line:10%
the human mind
entertained, so that you

01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:09.740 align:middle line:10%
don't get in the way
of important people

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:13.280 align:middle line:10%
by doing too much thinking.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.650 align:middle line:84%
You had better wake
up and understand

01:41:15.650 --> 01:41:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that there are people who
are guiding your life.

01:41:18.170 --> 01:41:19.430 align:middle line:90%
And you don't even know it.

01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:20.621 align:middle line:90%
>>We're in a lot of trouble!

01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:23.160 align:middle line:90%


01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.610 align:middle line:10%
Because you people and 62
million other Americans

01:41:27.610 --> 01:41:29.360 align:middle line:10%
are listening to me right now.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:34.002 align:middle line:10%
Because less than 3% of
you people read books.

01:41:34.002 --> 01:41:37.826 align:middle line:10%
Because less than 15%
of you read newspapers.

01:41:37.826 --> 01:41:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.

01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there is
a whole generation

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:49.858 align:middle line:84%
that never knew anything that
didn't come out of this tube.

01:41:49.858 --> 01:41:54.030 align:middle line:84%
This tube is the gospel,
the ultimate revelation.

01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:58.120 align:middle line:10%
This tube can make or
break presidents, popes,

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.115 align:middle line:10%
prime ministers.

01:41:59.115 --> 01:42:02.560 align:middle line:10%
This tube is the most
awesome god-damned force

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.275 align:middle line:10%
in the whole godless world.

01:42:04.275 --> 01:42:06.563 align:middle line:84%
And woe is us if it
don't fall into the hands

01:42:06.563 --> 01:42:07.620 align:middle line:90%
of the wrong people.

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:09.705 align:middle line:10%
And when the largest
company in the world

01:42:09.705 --> 01:42:14.000 align:middle line:10%
controls the most awesome
god-damned propaganda

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.350 align:middle line:10%
force in the whole godless
world, who knows what shit

01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:20.392 align:middle line:10%
will be painted for
truth on this network.

01:42:20.392 --> 01:42:22.310 align:middle line:90%
So you listen to me.

01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:23.744 align:middle line:90%
Listen to me.

01:42:23.744 --> 01:42:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Television is not the truth.

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Television's a god-dammed
amusement park.

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:31.135 align:middle line:10%
Television is a
circus, a carnival,

01:42:31.135 --> 01:42:35.400 align:middle line:10%
a traveling troupe of acrobats,
storytellers, dancers, singers,

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.500 align:middle line:10%
jugglers, side-show freaks, lion
tamers, and football players.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.950 align:middle line:84%
We're in the
boredom-killing business.

01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But you people sit there day
after day, night after night--

01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:49.110 align:middle line:90%
all ages, colors, creeds.

01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:50.650 align:middle line:90%
We're all you know.

01:42:50.650 --> 01:42:53.647 align:middle line:84%
You're beginning to believe the
illusions we're spinning here.

01:42:53.647 --> 01:42:55.730 align:middle line:84%
You're beginning to think
that the tube is reality

01:42:55.730 --> 01:42:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and that your own
lives are unreal.

01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:59.775 align:middle line:84%
You do whatever
the tube tells you.

01:42:59.775 --> 01:43:01.024 align:middle line:90%
You dress like the tube.

01:43:01.024 --> 01:43:01.940 align:middle line:90%
You eat like the tube.

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:03.523 align:middle line:84%
You raise your
children like the tube.

01:43:03.523 --> 01:43:05.420 align:middle line:90%
You even think like the tube.

01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:08.654 align:middle line:84%
This is mass
madness, you maniacs.

01:43:08.654 --> 01:43:11.600 align:middle line:84%
In God's name, you people
are the real thing.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.890 align:middle line:90%
We are the illusion!

01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:17.160 align:middle line:90%


01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>The last thing the
power establishment wants

01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:24.070 align:middle line:84%
is a conscious informed public
capable of critical thinking.

01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:26.550 align:middle line:10%
This is why a continually
fraudulent zeitgeist

01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:29.540 align:middle line:10%
is output, via religion,
the mass media,

01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.160 align:middle line:10%
and the educational system.

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.790 align:middle line:10%
It is in their
interest to keep you

01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:35.630 align:middle line:10%
in a distracted naive bubble.

01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are doing a
damn good job of it.

01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
This is Aaron Russo, a
filmmaker and former politician.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.360 align:middle line:84%
To his left is
Nicolas Rockefeller

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Council on
Foreign Relations.

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:50.240 align:middle line:84%
After maintaining a close
friendship with Nicholas,

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Aaron eventually ended
the relationship, appalled

01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:55.470 align:middle line:90%
by what he had learned.

01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>I got a call one day from
an attorney woman I knew.

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And she said, would you like to
meet one of the Rockefellers?

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure, I'd love to.

01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:06.090 align:middle line:90%
And we became friends.

01:44:06.090 --> 01:44:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And he began to divulge
a lot of things to me.

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So he said to me
one night, he said,

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.214 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be an event, Aaron.

01:44:14.214 --> 01:44:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And out of that event,
you're going to see,

01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.140 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go
into Afghanistan,

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.520 align:middle line:84%
so we can run pipelines
from the Caspian Sea.

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into
Iraq to take the oil

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and establish a base
in the Middle East.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
go into Venezuela

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of Chavez.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And the first two,
they've accomplished.

01:44:31.050 --> 01:44:33.147 align:middle line:90%
Chavez they didn't accomplish.

01:44:33.147 --> 01:44:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're going to see
guys going into caves looking

01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:39.570 align:middle line:84%
for-- [LAUGHS] looking for
people that they're never

01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:41.030 align:middle line:90%
going to find.

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:42.720 align:middle line:84%
He was laughing about
the fact that you

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.640 align:middle line:90%
have this war on terror.

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.900 align:middle line:90%
There's no real enemy.

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:49.465 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about how, by
having this war on terror,

01:44:49.465 --> 01:44:50.340 align:middle line:90%
you can never win it.

01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Because this thing's
an eternal war.

01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:55.319 align:middle line:84%
And so, you can always keep
taking people's liberties away.

01:44:55.319 --> 01:44:57.318 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how are you
going to convince people

01:44:57.318 --> 01:44:58.320 align:middle line:90%
that this war is real?

01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.837 align:middle line:90%
He said, with the media.

01:44:59.837 --> 01:45:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The media's going to
convince everybody it's real.

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, it's just that
you keep talking about things.

01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:07.140 align:middle line:84%
You keep saying it over
and over and over again.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
people believe it.

01:45:09.150 --> 01:45:12.990 align:middle line:84%
You created the Federal
Reserve in 1913 through lies.

01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:16.550 align:middle line:84%
You create 9/11,
which is another lie.

01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:18.957 align:middle line:84%
Through 9/11, then you are
fighting a war on terror.

01:45:18.957 --> 01:45:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a
sudden, you go into Iraq,

01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:22.530 align:middle line:90%
which was another lie.

01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:24.399 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're
going to do Iran.

01:45:24.399 --> 01:45:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it's one thing leading
to another, leading to another,

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:28.010 align:middle line:90%
leading to another.

01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I would say to him, what
are you doing this for?

01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:31.230 align:middle line:90%
What is the point of this thing?

01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:33.313 align:middle line:84%
You have all the money in
the world you ever want.

01:45:33.313 --> 01:45:34.384 align:middle line:90%
You have all the power.

01:45:34.384 --> 01:45:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know,
you're hurting people.

01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good thing.

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:40.104 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, what do you
care about the people for?

01:45:40.104 --> 01:45:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Take care of yourself.

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And take care of your family.

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, I said, so what
are the ultimate goals here?

01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:48.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, the ultimate
goal-- the ultimate goal

01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is to get everybody in this
world chipped with a RFID chip

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and have all money
be on those chips

01:45:54.570 --> 01:45:56.290 align:middle line:90%
and everything on those chips.

01:45:56.290 --> 01:45:58.425 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody wants
to protest what we do

01:45:58.425 --> 01:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
or violate what we want, we
just turn off their chip.

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>So how far will the
sickness of power go?

01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.310 align:middle line:84%
To what lengths will
those in control

01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:12.372 align:middle line:84%
go in order to maintain and
preserve their positions?

It is under this

we can foreshadow a world

The most incredible aspect of
all-- such the totalitarianism

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:22.600 align:middle line:84%
would likely not be
forced upon the people,

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.240 align:middle line:84%
rather the people
will demand it.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.490 align:middle line:84%
For the social

through the generation
of fear and division

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:33.330 align:middle line:84%

identification
and, thus, conceit

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:46.240 align:middle line:10%
has served to create a
controlled population, utterly

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.780 align:middle line:10%
malleable in the
hands of the few.

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Divide and conquer is the motto.

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And as long as people
continue to see themselves

01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:55.450 align:middle line:84%
as separate from
everything else,

01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%

and the truth of their personal
power to effect change,

the entire manufactured
zeitgeist that's preyed upon

01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:13.882 align:middle line:84%
would collapse like
a house of cards.

we live in drills into us

that we're powerless, that we're
weak, that our society is evil,

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that it's fragmented,
et cetera, and so forth.

01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:39.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all a big fat lie.

01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:43.880 align:middle line:84%
We are powerful,
beautiful, extraordinary.

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:48.320 align:middle line:84%
There is no reason why we cannot
understand who we truly are

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.180 align:middle line:90%
and where we are going.

01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:53.340 align:middle line:84%
There is no reason why the
average individual cannot be

01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.140 align:middle line:90%
fully empowered.

01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:58.400 align:middle line:84%
We are incredibly
powerful beings.

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, I think I spent 30 years
of my life, in the first 30,

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.434 align:middle line:90%
trying to become something.

01:49:04.434 --> 01:49:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to become
good at things.

01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to become a tennis.

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to become good
at school and grades.

01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:11.198 align:middle line:84%
And everything, I kind of
viewed in that perspective.

01:49:11.198 --> 01:49:12.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not OK the way I am.

01:49:12.710 --> 01:49:15.845 align:middle line:84%
But if I got good at
things-- I realized

01:49:15.845 --> 01:49:17.970 align:middle line:90%
that I had the game wrong.

01:49:17.970 --> 01:49:19.900 align:middle line:84%
The game to find out
what I already was.

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:43.630 align:middle line:90%


01:49:43.630 --> 01:49:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, in our
culture, we've been

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.880 align:middle line:84%
trained for individual
differences to stand out.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So you look at each person
immediately as brighter,

01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.730 align:middle line:84%
dumber, older, younger,
richer, poorer.

01:49:53.730 --> 01:49:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And we make all these
dimensional distinctions,

01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:59.330 align:middle line:84%
put them into categories,
and treat them that way.

01:49:59.330 --> 01:50:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And we get so that
we only see others

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.840 align:middle line:84%
as separate from ourselves
in the ways in which they're

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.080 align:middle line:90%
separate.

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the dramatic
characteristics of experience

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.410 align:middle line:84%
is being with another
person and suddenly

01:50:11.410 --> 01:50:13.850 align:middle line:84%
seeing the ways in
which they are like you,

01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:17.150 align:middle line:84%
not different from you; and
experiencing the fact, that

01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:19.320 align:middle line:84%
which is essence in you
and which is essence

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:22.310 align:middle line:84%
in me is indeed one, the
understanding that there

01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:24.040 align:middle line:90%
is no other.

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:24.968 align:middle line:90%
It is all one.

01:50:24.968 --> 01:50:29.282 align:middle line:90%


01:50:29.282 --> 01:50:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't born
Richard Albert.

01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I was just born
as a human being.

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, I learned this
whole business of who I am

01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:39.794 align:middle line:84%
and whether I'm good or
bad or achieving or not.

01:50:39.794 --> 01:50:41.168 align:middle line:84%
All that's learned
along the way.

A new consciousness
is developing

01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:14.150 align:middle line:84%

01:52:17.544 --> 01:52:18.710 align:middle line:90%
