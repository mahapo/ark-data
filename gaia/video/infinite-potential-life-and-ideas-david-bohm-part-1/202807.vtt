00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
ordinarily, when we look to
the sky and look to the stars,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
we think of stars as objects
far out and vast spaces between

way we can look at it.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:10%
We can look at the vacuum at the
emptiness instead as a planum,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:10%
as infinitely full rather
than infinitely empty,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:90%
wholeness.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Just as Copernicus had
upended cosmological thought

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:84%
in the 16th century by
suggesting that the Earth was

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:84%
in orbit around the
sun and not vise versa,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:84%
so too was Bohm starting
to intuit that we needed

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:84%
a fundamentally new way to
describe the connection between

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:90%
the macro and the micro.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>> My feeling is that that gave
an insight to Bohm that this

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:10%
world we live in, this
is all hard and fast.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:10%
The experts could order.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:10%
This is it.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:10%
It's really just
a surface order,

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:10%
it's not a deep profound
order, and there's

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:10%
something lies
underneath it, which

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:10%
he called the implicate order.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So the implicate
order is not so much

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:90%
a set of objects but a process.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of
constant movement

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
constantly unfolding
and unfolding.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.562 align:middle line:84%
So the expected order
comes out of the implicate.

00:11:16.562 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> David Bohm was suggesting
that everything is internally

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
related to everything else and
that each part of the cosmos

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.255 align:middle line:84%
contains the whole universe
and unfolds into our perception

00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:35.055 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:11:35.055 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> He would go into
biology and say, look,

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
this is the way biological
systems develop.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:10%
Nature is surely more
organic, and yet, we're

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:10%
trying to do in our
quantum mechanics just

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:10%
to make it mechanical.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps we should
move into that area

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:10%
and say that there is a
more organic way of thinking

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:10%
about life in general.

>> That's the key.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:10%
That's the deepest
hidden level of reality.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:90%
The gate of all wonders.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:90%

>> Exploring the philosophical
implications of both physics

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness, Bohm's
questioning of the scientific

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:10%
orthodoxy was the expression
of a rare and maverick

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:10%
intelligence in which
much of his most important

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:10%
contributions were
expressions of inner feelings,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.300 align:middle line:10%
which date back to his
early unhappy childhood.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:10%
David was born in Wilkes-Barre
on December the 20th, 1917.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
A coal mining town, once the
energy supplier of the world.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:10%
It had been hit by a serious
economic slump caused

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.160 align:middle line:10%
in large part by the declining
use of coal as a source of fuel

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:10%
in industry.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a great deal of
unemployment and suffering

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:10%
and people were out of jobs
and banks were failing.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:10%
People were talking about
things getting very bad, even

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:10%
revolution, and then
Roosevelt came in

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:10%
and he produced all
these new measures,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:10%
which gave people
hope, you see, and I

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:10%
think they lifted
things up a little bit

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:10%
and gave people some hope that
at least it would get better.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:10%
>> His mother was hospitalized
on several occasions from

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:10%
mental illness, and his father
was distant and disapproved

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:10%
of his son's
interest in science,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:10%
hoping instead that David would
one day take over the family

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:10%
business.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Life for the young
David was not ideal.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Bohm was unhappy.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:10%
He was unhappy at home,
unhappy with his father running

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:10%
a used furniture sales shop.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:10%
Ambition was that Bohm would
own the biggest furniture sales

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:10%
shop in Wilkes-Barre,
Pennsylvania.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Bohm didn't want to do that.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to explore
ideas, and his father

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:84%
wasn't very happy
about that, and he

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.705 align:middle line:84%
felt he lived in a
rather brutal world.

00:14:17.705 --> 00:14:20.428 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.428 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:10%
One day, he would hold up
a science fiction story

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:10%
called "The Skylark of Space"
about a boy who travels off

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:10%
to other planets in a spaceship.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That was his dream.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
If I can go to other planets,
they'll be ideal worlds.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So for him, this
world we live in,

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
this world of space and
time is rather imperfect.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:84%
It's an illusion, and beyond
that is a much deeper reality.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:84%
That was his school
vision, and then

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
as he grows up
and becomes older,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
that becomes his vision of what
he called the implicate order.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.033 align:middle line:84%
That beyond the everyday
Newtonian world view,

00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
there's a much deeper order
he called the implicate order,

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and that was what he
was groping towards.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:84%
How do we uncover this
deeper order of the world?

>> One day with a
group of friends,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
he was forced to cross
the stream by means

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:90%
of steppingstones.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I was with some boys and
we were in the mountains near

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Wilkes-Barre crossing a
rather rapidly flowing stream,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and there were a lot of rocks
we had to cross and they were

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:84%
really far apart and very
small, and we couldn't just step

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:84%
across them, and I
felt very apprehensive.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:90%
It was in the new situation.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But I suddenly realized you had
to jump from one to the other

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:90%
without stopping in between it.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
You were in a state of
movement, pivoting on one rock

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:84%
while you move to the
next, whereas I usually

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.385 align:middle line:84%
thought of going from
one step to another.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It was mapping out the steps.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:90%
After that, I felt that--

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
know it made a deep
impression on me,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:84%
that this theme has
recurred a lot in my work,

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness is going
moment by moment of awareness

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and not mapped out.

>> Despite his father's
disapproval of his interest

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:10%
in science, the young Bohm
proved to be an exceptional

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:10%
student, writing his unified
theory of the cosmos,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.660 align:middle line:10%
one that integrated mind and
matter while still at school.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:10%


00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:10%
>> I think this was combined
with some tendency to want

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:10%
to go beyond limits.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:10%
You see, when I was in this
small city of Wilkes-Barre

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and see that the nearest
towns around that

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:10%
were called Ashley, Sugar
Notch, and Warrior Run,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:10%
so that's all I knew.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I didn't know them.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:90%
I know about them.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.332 align:middle line:84%
And when we went for a
ride beyond Warrior Run,

00:16:45.332 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like going
beyond the world, you see.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Having finished high school,
the young Bohm moved to Penn

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
State University, where he
graduated with a physics

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:90%
degree.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
His exceptional ability
in mathematics and physics

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:06.839 align:middle line:84%
secured him a scholarship to
move to Caltech in California.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:10%
There, he met with
Robert Oppenheimer,

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:10%
who was sufficiently
impressed with Bohm

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:10%
to arrange for him to transfer
to the University of Berkeley,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.428 align:middle line:10%
where Oppenheimer headed
up the physics department.

00:17:20.428 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:10%


00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:10%
With a sense of rejection
from his own father,

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:10%
Bohm had sought father
figures, and it was clear

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:10%
that Robert Oppenheimer
was to fulfill that role.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> He became a student of
Oppenheimer to do a PhD,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and this was just before
Oppenheimer went off to set up

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos, the
nuclear facility.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So one day, when Oppenheimer
was going off to Los Alamos,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Bohm would have liked
to have joined him,

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
but he couldn't get
clearance, partly

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
because he joined the
Communist Party of America

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
for nine months, and then
what he was joining it

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
for was to try and see
if he could find people

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
so they could discuss
Hegel with them.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.210 align:middle line:84%
He finally wanted-- didn't
even know who Hegel was,

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
so he got totally disinterested
and didn't go again.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But because of
actually paying a fee,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:90%
he got smeared with communism.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:10%
Bohm's mathematical calculations
proved useful to the Manhattan

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:10%
Project in their quest to build
the world's first atomic bomb,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:10%
but the brigadier
general in charge

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:10%
told Oppenheimer that
Bohm was to be kept out.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
He suspected Bohm might
be a communist spy.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Denied security clearance, Bohm
lost access to his own work,

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.978 align:middle line:84%
making it impossible for
him to complete his thesis.

00:18:51.978 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, I can't
write the thesis,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
because the papers
have been classified.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And Oppenheimer said, OK,
just let's get the papers,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a PhD.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Oppenheimer needed Bohm's
work and had a very important

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.120 align:middle line:90%
job to do.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But little did Bohm know
that his early philosophical

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
idealism, coupled with
unfolding global unease,

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
would have a dramatic
impact on the trajectory

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:84%
that his life would
take from now on.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The Americans were
building an atom bomb.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.055 align:middle line:84%
The Germans and the
Russians are at war,

00:19:29.055 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's our duty to
help the Russians.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists,
including Oppenheimer,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.790 align:middle line:84%
felt we should talk
to the president

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and suggest maybe we should tell
the Russians what we're doing.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.473 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the President of
United States at that time

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
was in agreement
with that, but it

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:84%
was Churchill who overruled
him, and said, are you crazy?

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:10%
No, know don't tell
the Russians anything.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:10%
But that was it.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:10%
There was a sympathy.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the Russians should know a
little bit of what we're doing,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.223 align:middle line:10%
so maybe there was
sympathy among some

00:19:52.223 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:10%
of Oppenheimer's students.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Oppenheimer had gathered
around him a circle

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:10%
of exceptional
research students.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:10%
Oppenheimer himself supported
communist organizations

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:10%
and groups.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:10%
For Bohm, politics and
physics were inseparable,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:10%
and he soon discovered that
several of Oppenheimer students

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:10%
were interested in what they
termed The Russian Experiment,

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:10%
in which a Marxist
society would lead

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:10%
to the transformation
of the individual.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
This idea also played
into Bohm's work

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
in physics, where
he saw parallels

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:84%
between the movement
of electrons

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility of
individual human freedom.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
This led Bohm to one of his most
important early discoveries,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.745 align:middle line:84%
the theory of the
plasma in metals.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:50.467 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> A plasma is called the
fourth state of matter.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
There's gases, there's
liquids, there's solids,

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and the phosphate is like a
gas in which the gases are

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:90%
charged particles.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a bit like
what happens around the sun.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
You have a gas of charged
particles, and in a metal,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
the idea was a metal you'd
have a lattice, where

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
all the nuclear in the
lattice, the charge.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:90%
An electron runs through.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a gas of
electrons running through,

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and Bohm's idea was like,
can I look at the gas?

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Can I find a theory
for this gas?

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
What he found was that
the extent to which

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
an electron participated in this
gas, it became relatively free.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So it went back to his old idea
about the Russian experiment.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
To what extent-- if I am a
member of the collective-- can

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:90%
I have individual freedom?

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.093 align:middle line:90%
It seems a paradox.

00:21:39.093 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a member
of the collective,

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
then I don't have freedom.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of the group.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But he found to the extent to
which an electron participated

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
in the plasma, it became free.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It became free of the
interaction of other electrons,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:84%
so he began to say,
yes, within the plasma,

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
within the collective, there
can be individual freedom.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So it was both a theory
of the plasma in metals

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and the theory of freedom
in the collective.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Now having set up
that plasma physics,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:84%
he was recognized by
the people in Berkeley,

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and he was offered a job
at Princeton University.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Einstein was at
the Advanced Study Institute,

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:middle line:84%
but he was offered
a job at Princeton,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
because they taught
him a very talented

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:90%
young American physicist.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:10%
>> He went to Princeton, and
he took a room in a house next

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:10%
door to Einstein so he
would meet Einstein,

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:10%
they become close, he would go
to Einstein-- in the evening,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:10%
Einstein would have German
expatriates over playing

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.180 align:middle line:10%
the cello, violin,
have concerts,

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:10%
and he would go to those
and talk a lot to Einstein.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Dear Mr. Bohm, your letter
has interested me very much.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:10%
I am very astonished
about your announcement

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:10%
to establish some connection
between the formalism

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:10%
of quantum theory and
relativistic field theory.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I must confess that I
am not able to guess

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.705 align:middle line:84%
how such unification
could be achieved.

00:23:01.705 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Einstein said that he felt
Bohm was his spiritual son.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In this period, Bohm also
wrote a standard textbook

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
on quantum theory, which
presented the orthodox

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Copenhagen interpretation
of the theory,

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:90%
as outlined by Niels Bohr.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> He then was asked to give
a course on quantum mechanics,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and he gave an orthodox
course on quantum mechanics.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
course, he thought, well,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.613 align:middle line:84%
I don't really understand
this quantum mechanics.

00:23:39.613 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's the best thing to
do if you don't understand

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:90%
something is to write a book.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So he then wrote a book, which
he entitled "Quantum Theory,"

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
which had a reputation
of being one

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:84%
of the best books on
quantum theory at the time.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:84%
He was describing standard
quantum mechanics,

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Bohr's point of view.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to defend
Bohr's point of view.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Had a lot of discussions
about Bohr's point of view,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.930 align:middle line:84%
as well as some very
interesting applications

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:90%
of quantum mechanics.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was there
by looking at Bohr

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that he became very interested
in this notion of wholeness.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
A notion, which he carried into
a much more general situations,

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
as he got clearer
and clearer how

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.285 align:middle line:84%
wholeness was arising in the
quantum structure itself.

00:24:29.285 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> However, Bohm began to feel
that something was not quite

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
right about Niels
Bohr's interpretation,

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
believing that it placed a limit
on what could be said about

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.505 align:middle line:90%
the quantum world.

00:24:43.505 --> 00:24:47.686 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:51.095 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:51.095 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The quantum domain is
the subatomic realm.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The world of the smallest
things in the universe.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
All that is invisible
to the naked eye.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Since the 1920s, there
has been one experiment,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
which puts us up against
all the paradoxes

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.715 align:middle line:90%
and mysteries of nature.

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
The double slit
experiment, which

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
showed how everything we
assumed about electrons

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
since their discovery in the
19th century had been wrong.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:10%
If we fire electrons through two
slits, they start as particles,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:10%
but instead of creating
two distinct bands

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:10%
on the wall and the
other side, they in fact

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:10%
create an interference
pattern like waves.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:10%
In an effort to
decode this mystery,

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:10%
physicists decided to put a
measuring detector by one slit,

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.870 align:middle line:10%
but when they did, the
electrons did not produce

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:10%
any interference pattern.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The very act of
conscious observation

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
collapse the wave
pattern, and the electrons

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
returned once again to
behaving like particles.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.220 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.935 align:middle line:84%
What could be influencing
this curious behavior?

00:26:16.935 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:84%
This paradox has
been an accepted part

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of orthodox quantum physics.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
One that Niels Bohr
claimed could not

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:90%
be probed or explained.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But Bohm was developing
a strong hunch

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that there must be something
underneath the seemingly

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:90%
quixotic nature of electrons.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
That there was a process
or a potential that somehow

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:90%
informed their behavior.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Bohr had this idea that we
could not say anything about

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the underlying reality, and
people have taken that also

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:84%
to mean that they may not
be an underlying reality.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Einstein completely disagreed
with this point of view.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
He thought there must be
an underlying reality,

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and this underlying
reality would

>> Bohm felt that something
mysterious was happening,

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and the key for Bohm is that
what we observe as distinct

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and separate in our everyday
world of space and time is,

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:84%
in fact, connected and not
separate at the deeper quantum

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
level, because they are part
of a single system where

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:90%
separation does not exist.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:10%
But while Bohm continued
to be preoccupied

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:10%
with such questions,
his communist leanings,

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:10%
coupled with concerns at Los

colleagues at Berkeley
and Los Alamos.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:84%

he was arrested for

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:84%

the First Amendment,

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%

that will be a difficult
thing to get out of.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:10%
You must plead the
Fifth Amendment,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:10%
and the trouble with
the Fifth Amendment

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:10%
is that it's essentially
preventing you

from incriminating yourself.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.980 align:middle line:10%

frustrated with all

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:10%
these people
refusing to testify,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:10%
so he put to the
Supreme Court that it

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:10%
should be illegal to be made
illegal or unconstitutional

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:10%
to plead the Fifth
Amendment in this case.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And one day, when
Bohm was in Princeton,

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.880 align:middle line:84%
a Sheriff came and
actually arrested him,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and he was arrested because he
was using the Fifth Amendment.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
story here is that he

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:84%
said the Sheriff was a
very intelligent Sheriff,

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and they had a discussion on
the foundations of quantum

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.880 align:middle line:84%

driven from Princeton

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:84%

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Then he was bailed, but
very shortly after the bail,

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the high court ruled
that it was not

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:84%
unconstitutional to plead the
fifth, and so he was released.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But because he had been
enmeshed in this mess,

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.740 align:middle line:84%
the principal or the
head of the University

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.185 align:middle line:90%
