I was just feeling
horrible, but I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:84%
was following the
specific nutritional plan

eating, I stopped

drinking for six days,
because even water would

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.296 align:middle line:90%

My mother had cancer, my father
had chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:90%
so I was always struggling.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.795 align:middle line:84%
I got addicted to stimulants
big style, because they're

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
a way of getting a
little bit of energy

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to just get through

happy just go along, slowly

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:90%
depleting myself.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
There was no one saying,
you're low on energy?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:90%

painful to watch that,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.263 align:middle line:84%
knowing deep inside that
that there was a way.

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
There was a way
to heal ourselves.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a way.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't be suffering.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, raw food means food
in its most natural state,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
without heat or without going
through any type of a process,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
which means that if you pull
a carrot out of the ground,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you start munching on
it like Bugs Bunny that's raw.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you take that
carrot into the kitchen

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and you throw it into a steamer,
you apply heat and saute it,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
then it becomes no longer raw.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Hey, that's me!

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.455 align:middle line:84%
My name's Seth, and most people
consider me an average Joe.

00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And don't get me wrong,
there's nothing wrong

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
with being average,
but it's not really

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
what I saw myself doing
when I was younger.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my
18-year-old self could

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
see how average
I'd become at 30,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I think he'd have a
real problem with it.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And understand, I know I
don't have diabetes yet,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have cancer yet, and
I don't have heart disease yet,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not obese, but I
am feeling pretty rough.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
At 30 years old, I can't
make it through the day

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
without wanting to take
a nap, and my body aches,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
my hair's thinning, sex drive's
kind of going down the toilet,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:90%
So this is average?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely
don't be average.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.155 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a
better Seth out there.

00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where this
experiment comes in.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I figured if I don't want the
standard American diseases,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I got to stop eating the
standard American diet.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm switching to raw food,
raw living food, for 60 days.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:90%
See what that does.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Tell you what?

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.366 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about seeing
how much better I can be.

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, since we
started thinking

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
about the idea of going
60 days completely raw,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of very
incredulous people asking me,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
why in the world
would you do that?

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want to make
such a drastic change?

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, as I start
thinking about it,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
the reason I want to make
such a drastic change really

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
has to do with not feeling
shiny, and not feeling

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
in any way, shape or form,
the version of myself

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
that I know I can be and
the version of myself

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I envision myself being.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm 30 years old, and I've
been through a lot of garbage

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:90%
in the last seven years.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
While I've been
incredibly blessed

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
with an amazing relationship
with my wife Lindsay,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and all that's brought to
me, I've dealt with a divorce

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
before Lindsay, and I dealt
with abandonment issues

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
that I've had passed
down from my father

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
when my parents got divorced,
now feeling that that was being

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:90%
passed on to my daughter Piper.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And then not being able to see
her as often as I wanted to

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
was something-- it just
started bringing up hate.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.852 align:middle line:84%
It started bringing up a
lot of things inside of me

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:90%
that I never knew were there.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, I started dealing with
familial issues, anger issues,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And the intention of this is
to see if cleaning up my food,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.278 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning up
that aspect of it

00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
is going to clean
up everything else.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to knock this
dirt and this muck off

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of my relationships, knock
this muck and dirt off

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
of everything that's not doing
what it's supposed to do,

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:90%
and become shiny again.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.343 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:06:05.343 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea if
this is going to work,

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.385 align:middle line:84%
but I want to gain
enlightenment.

00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that you can do
it through changing your diet,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted a better
version of myself,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to be able to
focus on the things that

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:90%
are important to me.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And through this 60-day
journey, I'm hoping to do that.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to get enlightenment,
and also to get healthier.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm changing.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.147 align:middle line:84%
I really don't feel like
being average anymore.

00:06:31.147 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So I thought going raw probably
wasn't going to be real easy.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So to get a little help
on this experiment,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd call
in some big guns.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
First call, I gave
Russell James a ring,

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:90%
world-renowned Raw Chef.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Next guy I call in was
Paul Risse, like a cowboy.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Who is that tall drink of water?

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
That's my younger
brother, Daniel.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I like to call him the director.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Penni Shelton's
my raw food momma.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Every time I call,
she answers the phone

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:90%
and helps me through my dilemma.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got Dave
the Raw Food Trucker.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
He's a networker, and I am
happy to call him a friend.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.524 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.524 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And that leads us to
our doctor, Dr. Tibbels.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello sir.

>> Sir.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Tibbels is going to
administer our pre and post raw

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
food medical tests.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, tell me what you're
hoping to learn with this

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:90%
little experiment you're doing.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctor Tibbels
asked a good question.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And really the answer is simple,
I just want to feel better.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
sick all the time.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
tired all the time.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be average.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get an
average American disease.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want to see if raw
foods will help me with that.

>> Time to Shine, buddy.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:84%

to do with this?

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what to do.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:90%
You know what to do.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%

>> Now, I've given blood for
numerous reasons in the past.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Say, life insurance,
just trying to do my part

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to give to the blood bank,
and it's never ended well.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
never been a time

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:90%
where I haven't passed out.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, I
become incontinent.

doesn't happen here.

that will be interesting to be

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:90%
part of.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
You're up in the game as
far as food is concerned.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's very
cheap to eat rubbish.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the
system is set up in a way

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
that broccoli is more expensive
than a burger, you know?

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's no wonder that
a lot of these families

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.445 align:middle line:84%
with very small incomes resort
to feeding their family--

00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>> McDonald's.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
You can feed a whole family
of four on a few bucks.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So before I got started
in this experiment,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to immerse myself
into raw food and the raw food

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Penny and Russell told me
about this conference that

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:90%
was going on out in California.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So loaded down with nothing but
a camera and a backpack, Daniel

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:90%
and I headed to California.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
There we are, landed in
beautiful sunny Southern

California, headed to the
Longevity Now Conference.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:90%
And we have no appointments.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:90%
We have no tickets.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Wonder what we're
going to come up.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Right now!

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Raw interview take 1.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Went from eating a
healthy organic diet,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.982 align:middle line:84%
to a vegetarian diet, to eating
a vegan diet in a kind of--

00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Natural progression.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Natural progression.

00:11:01.898 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Raw definitely is something
that I don't know if it works

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely working for us.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> What's more intimate
than that which you put

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:90%
in your body?

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
You really think about
it, and so food really

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.250 align:middle line:90%
is a sacred thing.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been traveling around
the world doing raw food

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:90%
for the past six years.

Really helping to support

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:90%
and changing their lives.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.293 align:middle line:84%
And also learning
a lot about myself

00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:90%
and my own personal health--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So here we are
at the airport, LAX,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
boarding the plane
to go back to Dallas.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
We've been here at the
Longevity Now Conference.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the original
plan for this documentary

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
was for me to just
be the photographer,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:84%
but being at this conference and
hearing everyone's testimonies,

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and everyone is so
full of life, I mean,

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get a
piece of the life

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.645 align:middle line:84%
that all these
people are living.

00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Tibbels rang us up
and let me know that the test

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:90%
results are in.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So now, it's time to
go check them out.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The negative thing is
you have some significant

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:90%
deficiencies.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the saddest thing is
that it's not that surprising.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.095 align:middle line:84%
Most people living the
average American life will

00:12:12.095 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
have significant deficiencies,
but they'll never know it,

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
going to feel bad enough

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.563 align:middle line:90%
to go seek it out--

00:12:19.563 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Until they have
a heart attack.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Until they have
a big problem.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I was deficient in quite a
few very important nutrients

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
vitamins and minerals, starting
with vitamin B12, vitamin D,

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:84%
zinc, magnesium, vitamin
C, and vitamin E.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So the conclusion of my
initial results shows me to be

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.523 align:middle line:84%
deficient in B12, which
is a little shocking,

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:84%
because supposedly you're
supposed to be able to get

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of B12 from meat,
and dairy, and poultry,

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's all I've been
eating for the last 90 days.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Next up is vitamin D,
and it's no shock here,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
because 80% of Americans are
deficient in vitamin D. When

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
you don't have
enough vitamin D, it

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
leads to high blood pressure,
depression, weakness, fatigue,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.963 align:middle line:90%
and soft bones and teeth.

00:12:56.963 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Not having enough
zinc probably has more

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:84%
to do with the soil depletion of
our commercial farming industry

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:84%
than it does with anything
else, but because zinc

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is so important for the
production of testosterone

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of sexual
functions, I sure

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
would like to see
this one go up.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm low on magnesium,
and that's troubling

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
because magnesium is responsible
for over 300 chemical reactions

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this thing keeps
our heart beating steady.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
On vitamin C's
resume is the ability

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
to build collagen.
Without vitamin C,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
we'd have a bunch
of flabby noses,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and flabby bones,
and saggy skin.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So I probably get a
little more vitamin C,

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and this just comes from
eating more vegetables.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin E is only
found in plants.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And because vitamin E is
so essential in getting rid

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of free radicals, it will
help ward off my body

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:90%
from the big C--

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you show a deficient
total antioxidant function,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
which is just a measure of how
well your body deals with free

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.850 align:middle line:90%
radicals.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
The fact that this is average,
that this is somewhat normal,

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:90%
is sickening.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my point, yeah.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And normal is
not the right word.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not normal.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.078 align:middle line:84%
This isn't how we were
meant to function.

00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:04.245 align:middle line:84%
With the right lifestyle,
and the right environment,

00:14:04.245 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
with the right
fuel, you wouldn't

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:90%
have these deficiencies.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's not normal,
but it's common.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Your testosterone is low.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
It could be low normal, and
I would tell you it's low

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to be
addressed, because normal

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean much.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:90%
You're way below optimal.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You're way low even based on
traditional medical standards.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Way low.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Profoundly low.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:35.313 align:middle line:84%
The reference range from
this lab is 250 to 836.

00:14:35.313 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:84%
You could be in a
low end of that,

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.063 align:middle line:84%
and I would tell you that
that's not normal for your age

00:14:39.063 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:90%
at all, OK?

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a
number of 300, 400,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and I would tell you, eh, that's
not so hot at 30 years old.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So what doc's telling me is
that a 30-year-old with normal

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
testosterone levels would
be right around 600.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Your number,
your total, is 146.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
You're free
testosterone, and I'll

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.416 align:middle line:84%
give you the normal
reference range is 40 to 250,

00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:90%
and yours is 24.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> This is grossly bad.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Any physician who checked
your levels would say,

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.080 align:middle line:84%
this guy has
hypogonadism officially.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a difficult diagnosis.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not a stretch.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> You have
low-functioning testicles,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
low functioning production
of testosterone for your age.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally, you
would come to a doctor,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and they would see this,
and they would replace it.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.797 align:middle line:84%
You'd be on
testosterone replacement

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:32.880 align:middle line:84%
probably for the rest of
your life to some degree.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
It's an injection.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an injection once a
week, and after some time,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:90%
there are other options.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:90%
You can do topical gels.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:90%
You can do insertable pellets.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Insertable pellets?

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Only if you want.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't want!

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The list is endless in
terms of subjective things,

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and things that you may feel bad
about when the testosterone is

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.700 align:middle line:90%
low.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The long-term health
risks are also endless.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, brain function,
cardiovascular health,

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:90%
prostate.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So either way,
it'll be addressed.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Because these are numbers
that if these don't normalize

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:84%
significantly, which
to be honest with you,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll be surprised if they do.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I hope that they do,
but I'll be surprised.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you mean through the diet?

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:90%
Through the raw food?

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If diet change alone
normalizes these numbers,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
then you have a real
significant result.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I would be very surprised.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
If you can normalize
this, you will

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
have astounded me, and
probably a lot of other people.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.288 align:middle line:84%
>> The scariest thing I heard
was the word "hypogonadism."

00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
what that means,

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
but it sounds really
scary, and it's

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a part of
my body I'd rather not

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:90%
take a chance on.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So here's to hoping raw
foods does the trick.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It just kept progressing
worse, and worse, and worse.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
And it got so bad, Seth,
that I was almost immobile.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:13.644 align:middle line:84%
I really came to a
point in my life right

00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:90%
where I was hopeless.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
I literally felt if I continue
on this downward slide

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to die.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We were about eating
fried chicken on Sundays,

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
eating pork chops
on Thursday nights.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>> So you had a set menu?

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Hot dogs and
macaroni and cheese,

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.637 align:middle line:84%
that was the standard
when I was really young.

00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Standard American diet.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Standard American diet.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If I drop everything I've
been doing for the past 25

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
years and start this path,
that's going pretty hard.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Shock your body.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's going
to shock my body.

00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So I became more
conscious and aware

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:84%
of what it felt like to taste
the foods that were societally

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:90%
given to me as my diet.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, I just
gained such awareness,

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
because that food does
actually not work right.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.253 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:17:59.253 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:84%
You chew it in
your mouth, and you

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.555 align:middle line:90%
see that it just doesn't fit.

00:18:02.555 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't give you energy.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.663 align:middle line:84%
>> So you made a switch
from just vegetarian,

00:18:05.663 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of tinkering
with that whole thing.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Predominantly vegetarian.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Ate a healthy diet
in general terms.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Took vitamins each day.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Overnight went to a raw, vegan,
organic, fresh food, life food

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
diet, which I don't recommend
for most people to do,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:84%
because it can be a little
bit traumatic for me.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.835 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm about to do,
so it's a vote of confidence

00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:25.635 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:25.635 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I say transition into
it gently if you can.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that the results are in,
and hypogonadism works lurks

00:18:33.518 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
along with some other
problems, it's time to head

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
to the grocery store where we're
going to fill our kitchen with

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.335 align:middle line:84%
a good, yummy,
raw, living foods.

00:18:41.335 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> See it's raw walnuts.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.022 align:middle line:90%
>> It says raw?

00:18:45.022 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What are we up to in here?

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Just gathering some raw food.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.535 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:18:50.535 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make some nice
candy nuts for our salads.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.002 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.002 --> 00:19:00.376 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:00.376 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You know what else is
a really good snack?

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Pink Lady.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I went into my kitchen
and I threw every thing away

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:90%
in the kitchen--

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:84%
all the condiments, all
the flours, all the sugars,

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.018 align:middle line:84%
all the cereals, everything
in the refrigerator.

00:19:18.018 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Even if there was fruits
and vegetables in there,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:90%
I threw everything away.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It was the process of releasing
that and starting anew,

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I did that.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And I drove to the
store, and I bought

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
organic fruits and
organic vegetables,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't turned back since.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, Lindsey and I
are about to do a fridge clean

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and a pantry clean to get
rid of all of our foods that

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
aren't raw, so we're
not tempted by them.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a cream cheese.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Butter.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Spinach artichoke dip
with some [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Got a brand new
thing of tomato ketchup.

00:20:00.252 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Tabasco, spicy brown
mustard, Greek yogurt,

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:84%
bagels, block of
sharp, sharp cheddar,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
turkey bacon, Eggos, crispy
thin crust four cheese,

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
chocolate cookies, GO Lean
crisp, Log Cabin, Swiss Miss,

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Minute Rice.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So I've got my
food squared away.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Got the bad food out,
I've got the good food in.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now I need to get
my kitchen set up

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the way a raw chef would
have his kitchen set up.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:90%
So who do we call?

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:90%
The Raw Chef.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first thing I would
definitely advise is a juicer.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a must.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to be
suggesting that I juice a lot?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because juice is
the easiest way to just get

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
nutrients straight
into your bloodstream.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You're getting some very
high level of nutrition.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I actually had this made up
especially for this countertop.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Normally this is the hob,
which obviously I don't use.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> The hob?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Hob.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know what a hob is?

00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Never heard of a hob.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you mean the stovetop?

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.545 align:middle line:90%
>> A stove top, yeah.

00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I know this thing.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I've got one of these.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's great.

00:20:59.293 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, green smoothies is
going to be another staple.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And then food processor,
really useful.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do that.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.083 align:middle line:90%
Dehydrator.

00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:90%
I've got my teas here.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to be able to have
something hot, you know?

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at this.

00:21:11.782 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
He has stepladders
for his stuff in here.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.902 align:middle line:90%
>> They are great.

00:21:15.902 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
back down on this.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I wouldn't even know
there was more tea back there

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.590 align:middle line:90%
stepladders weren't there.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.275 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a big problem.

00:21:22.275 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Honey?

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So you're not vegan?

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.462 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:29.462 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people that
consider themselves vegan

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:90%
and still eat honey.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>> You know it's bee puke?

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do.

00:21:35.225 --> 00:21:36.025 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Honey is delicious.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the DNA
that I've been trying out.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.065 align:middle line:90%
The amino acid complex.

00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Amino acid complex?

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it just a
bunch of amino acids?

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Like we're talking
with a protein?

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Most people think
you need to eat

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:90%
direct protein to get protein.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.247 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's like a protein
powder, but it's not protein.

00:21:56.247 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not protein.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the amino
acids which allow your body

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:90%
to build protein.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And you suggest
me maybe trying that?

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it seems like it's
pretty effective at the moment.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>> What have we got?

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> A package in the mail.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I believe it is my DNA.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> There it is.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> That is going to be the only
supplement that I take besides

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:90%
raw food.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me a little bit
more about that stuff.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.492 align:middle line:90%
This is what Russell had.

00:22:21.492 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Down the hatch.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think I should
go for all of them?

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're like
mom, you sure can.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Gone-zo.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Like nothing.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone-zo.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't start
out eating raw.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I took three
years to transition.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it was a
lifelong transition.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want to just
go cold turkey so that I

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:90%
would flip back at some point.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.240 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to do this forever.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There's definitely raw foods
can be cleansing on the system,

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:84%
if someone who's had a lot
of processed foods and stuff,

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:90%
it's a good way to cleanse.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good way to find
out once you've cleansed,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:90%
how to start rebuilding.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people go too far on raw
and cleanse, cleanse, cleanse,

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and then they look sick.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>> So you can go too far.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:90%
There's definitely an ebb.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a
delicate balance.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Definitely. like all things.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's important
not to make it too big,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
because if somebody
looks and says, OK,

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:90%
how do I changed my diet?

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.802 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I have
to change everything,

00:23:29.802 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
have to cut everything out,
I can never do this again?

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not about rules.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.068 align:middle line:90%
It's not about never.

00:23:34.068 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
It's to take one thing in
your life that's not working.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:84%
If every time you eat red meat,
or if you would try and have

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:90%
a piece of organic meat--

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.183 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't eat
meat, but if I say,

00:23:44.183 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't do
all these things,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.225 align:middle line:84%
a person's going to
turn the other way.

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Just try something a little bit
better in your area of comfort,

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and once you tackle
that then add onto that,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I lasted is six days
on the juice feast,

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and I was gagging
from the juice.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:84%
On the seventh day
couldn't drink the juice.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I started actually
throwing up on the juice.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't handle the taste.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.950 align:middle line:90%
My body was just so--

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Rejecting it.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Realize that I was eating
three pounds of red meat a day

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:90%
when I went raw.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I was eating three two-pound
blocks of toma cheese a week,

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.507 align:middle line:84%
I was drinking two
two-liter Diet Cokes a day.

00:24:22.507 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When he went through the
drive-through it wasn't just

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:84%
a supersized meal, it was five
quarter-pounders with cheese,

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.217 align:middle line:90%
Biggie fries, Biggie soda.

00:24:31.217 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no kidding.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:90%
First day on the raw.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You see here, you've got
our Holy Moly Granoli.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.245 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.245 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> How was that eating
raw right there?

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Tasty.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
A good meal before I
head off to my daily job.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.405 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling pretty
excited actually.

00:25:01.405 --> 00:25:07.827 align:middle line:84%
A little eager to be
past the stage of what

00:25:07.827 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
people tell me the
first couple weeks.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Usually you're detoxing.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Usually you're craving,
hungry, and I don't really

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:90%
want to deal with that.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:90%
The dream begins.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:90%
So day one in the books.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.213 align:middle line:84%
Day two in the morning, I
get an email from Russell.

00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me to look at
this video of the RawBrahs made

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:90%
with this guy named Paul Risse.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I start to
watch this, and I'm

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:84%
watching this guy do
inverted handstand push ups

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I realize there's
no way he's raw.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where does
he get his protein?

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
How is a guy able to do
Superman push ups on a raw diet?

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's raw.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:90%
His name's Paul Risse.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.905 align:middle line:84%
So intrigued, Daniel,
Lindsay, and I, well,

00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:84%
we loaded up the car
and headed to the Cowboy

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Capital of the World--

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Stephenville, Texas.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about
being in the Cowboy

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.063 align:middle line:90%
Capital of the World?

00:26:01.063 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know what
to think right now.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>> There.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:90%
It's famous barbecue pit.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a place to
eat a bunch of meat.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.842 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.842 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Seth.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul Risse.

00:26:16.616 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul, nice to meet you.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:90%
This is my wife Lindsay.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Lindsay?

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Daniel.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Daniel.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Daniel?

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> My brother.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Your brother, huh?

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Cowboy Capital, Dairy
Capital, and UFO Capital,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
so put those three things in a
blender and see what you get,

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We're here at Barefoot
Market where Paul Risse works.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:84%
He's got his own little corner
of the health food store

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
where he prepares lovely
raw foods, and juices,

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of goodies.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.563 align:middle line:84%
>> It has pecan butter, and
coconut, and [INAUDIBLE] honey.

00:26:45.563 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:84%
You got to know
honey is part of--

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Linds, come eat
some wheat grass.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you like
some wheat grass, sir?

00:26:51.187 --> 00:26:52.197 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd love some.

00:26:52.197 --> 00:26:53.457 align:middle line:90%
>> I've never had this.

00:26:53.457 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Obviously, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It is good.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Y'all know the drill.

00:26:57.694 --> 00:26:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mmm.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I like the ending flavor.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Raw foods is an
interesting one.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through the
whole gamut with it.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the crowds,
I've met the people,

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I've been to the restaurants.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.972 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I put myself
through the test.

00:27:12.972 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It's something I'll do
for the rest of my life.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not I'll
be 100% or not,

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of
irrelevant in my mind.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But I understand that
what raw foods does offer

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is the highest
amount of nutrition

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:90%
that you could possibly get.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
There's some things you can say
specifically about raw foods.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
One is it it's healing.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%
It's cleansing.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.725 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest amount of
nutrition you can get in food.

00:27:36.725 --> 00:27:38.392 align:middle line:84%
It's the least amount
of damage that you

00:27:38.392 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
can do to the Earth with the
most amount of health benefit

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:90%
to your body.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
things you can say.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so this is cacao butter
and it's liquid chocolate

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can use it like
soap in the shower.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's been one of the
best things I've ever

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:90%
found in the world for my skin.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It also works topically as
a source of magnesium, zinc,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.568 align:middle line:90%
iron, chromium.

00:27:58.568 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Smells delightful too.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's-- yeah.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at you!

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I have women that come here
and they're just like licking

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:90%
their hand.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Normally, we always eat
because of social emotional

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
habit, but hardly
ever it's hunger.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It's hardly ever my body saying,
I'm really hungry for this.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.576 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.576 --> 00:28:19.935 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty complex thing
really for most people.

00:28:19.935 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And most people, if they're
starting this and they're not

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
as young as y'all, they've been
eating a certain way for 30 40

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.360 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.072 align:middle line:84%
They taught their body
things that just put them

00:28:29.072 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
in a place that's
really unhealthy,

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.630 align:middle line:90%
but it's also their habits.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like every part of
their psychological makeup

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.458 align:middle line:90%
is that food.

00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of ways
you're asking people

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to take away their best
friend, their soul comfort.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people find, instead of
a relationship, a relationship

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:84%
with God, or a
relationship with a person,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:90%
they find that in food.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called comfort food.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
The sweetness is that
lack of the relationship.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Talk to us about what's in here.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I see hemp.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I see goji.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>> A little organic apple, some
local pecans blended up with

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:84%
coconut oil, honey,
some Celtic sea salt,

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and then some hemp seeds.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Good source of complete protein.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.133 align:middle line:90%
Then the goji berries.

00:29:10.133 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows about those.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Lots of vitamin C. Good
amino acid profile.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's just deliciousness
in your mouth.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> This is really amazing.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.855 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just pure goodness.

00:29:24.855 --> 00:29:26.765 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'd like
to say is a joke--

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a joke
because it's kind of true

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.808 align:middle line:84%
also is that [INAUDIBLE]
places, the Cowboy Capital

00:29:30.808 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of the World and Dairy
Capital of the World

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:90%
has a certain mentality.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
If you threw in the UFO
Capital of the World

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:84%
it kind of messes up
that mentality entirely.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So what I like to say is that
the UFOs came here before me,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.490 align:middle line:84%
so that whenever I introduce
raw foods to the community,

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.490 align:middle line:84%
they're like, oh,
that's not that weird.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.257 align:middle line:90%
>> I just saw a UFO.

00:29:46.257 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very normal.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a little
trail behind my house.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:84%
This is where I take people
to train or I train myself.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Meditate and pray out here also.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the pool where the
other video was shot at.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you're going
to show us that?

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Seth, your turn.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not there yet.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Looks pretty similar.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
infamous workout tree.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.662 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where
I do my pull ups.

00:30:31.662 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
the best ab routine

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.022 align:middle line:84%
that I've found,
because what it does

00:30:35.022 --> 00:30:39.580 align:middle line:84%
is it makes the weakest part
your body the strongest.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.548 align:middle line:90%
And it makes a bridge--

00:30:40.548 --> 00:30:42.090 align:middle line:84%
so this part of your
body is a bridge

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.083 align:middle line:84%
that's collapsing and
opening every time.

00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Could you work on
your handstands?

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:90%
What we're going to this come--

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:90%
you can use a wall.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use
this pecan tree.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm just connecting and
balancing right here.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.564 align:middle line:90%
That's all I want you to do.

00:30:54.564 --> 00:30:56.476 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:30:56.476 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> See?

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:02.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't look natural.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa!

00:31:06.748 --> 00:31:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You scared me!

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I get.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, gosh.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So what do you do for cardio?

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I run.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Run?

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do sprints, I ride my bike,
play basketball, play Frisbee.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Just natural stuff.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:23.073 --> 00:31:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're literally walking on
food that you buy in the store,

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and this is 1,000 times
better than any onion--

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:90%
onion right there.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The strawberries, and
cantaloupe, and everything

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:90%
are back in there.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.865 align:middle line:84%
>> So Paul's taken us back to
this little meditation/garden

00:31:35.865 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
that he's put in the
back of his house,

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is where we spend some
time praying and eating raw

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:90%
vegetables.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Yummy!

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> The chia?

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.367 align:middle line:90%
This is a chia.

00:31:47.367 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just planted some
of it in the ground,

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.465 align:middle line:84%
but to harvest it
basically you're

00:31:51.465 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:84%
just stripping it off
and rubbing your hands.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And there you have
beautiful little chia seeds.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.660 align:middle line:84%
The Tarahumara, they're
an Indian tribe.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:84%
They run up to 100
miles at a time.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:84%
They put a bunch of these in
their cheek, and what it does

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:84%
is it slowly releases omega
3, 6, and 9, essential fatty

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:84%
acids, and gives them
sustained energy.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It's also a really good
source of amino acids.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that seems like an odd
bit of information for somebody

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:84%
to know, but I googled
it, and he's right.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.485 align:middle line:84%
Paul, what an
encyclopedia of knowledge!

00:32:24.485 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But we are leaving
the Cowboy Capital

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:33.060 align:middle line:84%
of the World, and just
absolutely amazing trip

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:90%
that we had here.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And delightful food!

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Man, that stuff we ate
up at the Barefoot Market

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.514 align:middle line:84%
in Stephenville
was unbelievable.

00:32:42.514 --> 00:32:43.957 align:middle line:90%
It was awesome.

00:32:43.957 --> 00:32:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so today, when
I got hungry and I was driving

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.060 align:middle line:84%
past all the fast
food restaurants,

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I honestly almost said, we'll
just do this another time.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I almost pulled into Popeyes.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:56.872 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
mad, not because I

00:32:56.872 --> 00:32:58.330 align:middle line:84%
thought about
putting into Popeyes,

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I was mad because I
couldn't have Popeyes.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.068 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know what?

00:33:02.068 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not really worth it.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll just eat this
way, I'll be unhealthy,

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:90%
and I'll die whenever I die.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It's no big deal, but at
least I had fun while I ate.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:84%
We came back for our
groceries and I made dinner.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:16.120 align:middle line:84%
We had a delightful snack
of tomatoes, avocados,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:90%
some homemade raw hummus.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Very delightful.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Really good.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, just for
a little snack here,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.367 align:middle line:84%
we're doing a little
almond butter and apples.

00:33:26.367 --> 00:33:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what, I'm
so happy I didn't do that.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
After eating that dinner and
eating all this live food

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel full, satiated,
but I feel really,

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.200 align:middle line:90%
really, really good.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And don't feel like
I need to take a nap.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.267 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like I
need to go to sleep.

00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:42.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:84%
With Paul Risse on my team,
my confidence grew even more,

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and days three through
six were a breeze.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Tasty food, tons of
energy, sleeping well,

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:90%
everything was going swimmingly.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Until day 7 came,
and this happened.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.630 align:middle line:84%
He came right home and
plopped himself on that bed.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.841 align:middle line:84%
>> I really don't feel like
talking to the camera, really.

00:34:07.841 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You detoxing?

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that's what it is.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.298 align:middle line:90%
It's either that or the flu.

00:34:13.298 --> 00:34:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it
shouldn't be the flu.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system
should be up, not down.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] a lot of water.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I needed some
help with my detox.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Paul and
Penny on the phone

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and then I Skyped with Russell.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The more vegetable juices
you can drink the better,

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.415 align:middle line:84%
because they've got all
the vitamins, and minerals,

00:34:36.415 --> 00:34:39.239 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of stuff, whereas,
the fruit doesn't have as much.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:90%
The fruit just tastes good.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure you're
drinking lots of water,

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.752 align:middle line:84%
and you can ride it
out till tomorrow

00:34:43.752 --> 00:34:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and see how you get on.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:49.620 align:middle line:84%
You could have like a
sauna and sweat it out.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm?

00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:55.812 align:middle line:84%
I took a really hot
bubble bath last night.

00:34:55.812 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my goodness.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a man
tell me that before.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> He was so
[INAUDIBLE] last night.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take a bubble bath!

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you light some candles?

00:35:09.421 --> 00:35:10.323 align:middle line:90%
He did!

00:35:10.323 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Detox is a word that's
thrown around quite a lot,

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and it means different
things to different people.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.850 align:middle line:84%
To someone detox might
be just giving up alcohol

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.160 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of weeks, and
they feel better from that.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I think there's lots of
different levels, you know?

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're used to caffeine,
I see you walking around

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.470 align:middle line:84%
with coffee, that's going
to probably give you

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.790 align:middle line:90%
some headaches.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, actually
you'll get headaches.

00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not probably.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's going to happen.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.840 align:middle line:84%
A lady in the raw
food world called

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Tonya K. I don't know if
you've heard of Tonya?

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.400 align:middle line:84%
She's very outgoing,
a great personality.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And she says my body is
not a discounted body.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I will not put into my
mouth and into my body, food

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.000 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't support me.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.750 align:middle line:84%
A homeless guy was offered
some food by a restaurant,

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of junk
food, and he turned it down.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said, why would
you turn down this food?

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, it's junk
food, and if I ruin my body,

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't have anywhere to live.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.145 align:middle line:84%
So there's a guy on the
street with no money,

00:36:10.145 --> 00:36:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and he's got a
standard for himself.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.667 align:middle line:84%
And it really is what
standard you set for yourself,

00:36:14.667 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:90%
because you'll find a way.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.505 align:middle line:90%
If you find a way to do this--

00:36:18.505 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got
the extra motivation

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.330 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
cameras in front of you.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It has to happen.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> During the next
three days of my detox,

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time wrapped
up in my bed like a swaddled

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
little baby, or on my
knees at the toilet.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't pretty, but
at my breaking point,

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.920 align:middle line:84%
on the morning of
the fourth day,

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I turned the corner,
with the sun shining

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.870 align:middle line:84%
bright through the windows,
and I thought I could fly.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.310 align:middle line:90%
No really.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.720 align:middle line:90%
I thought I could fly!

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.302 align:middle line:84%
The most amazing
feeling I've ever felt.

00:36:48.302 --> 00:36:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> In my work in television--

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.340 align:middle line:90%
I travel all over the world--

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:90%
and I was running on empty.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to have a week
back here in Santa Monica,

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and I said you know,
I'm going to try

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:90%
The Box at a local restaurant.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And they prepare the raw food
for you for an entire week.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was like,
OK, I'll do it.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that
week I was coming back

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.720 align:middle line:84%
from a 70-mile bike
ride, and then I

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
went and did a two-hour
kick ass yoga class,

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and then I still had
energy to go and swim laps.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> All in one day?

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, this is all
in one afternoon.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I was like,
OK, what is going on here?

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.140 align:middle line:90%
This is something.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:30.560 align:middle line:84%
This is something that other
people need to figure out.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, PR came up to
visit for the weekend.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, good morning.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Now today is a wonderful
day, in case you didn't know.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:84%
We got a package of goodies
from Nutiva this morning.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.760 align:middle line:84%
We got coconut oil here,
which is always helpful.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We got some hemp seed
that I'll be spending

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:90%
a lot of time munching on.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We've got all this
lovely chia seed.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Life is good.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.720 align:middle line:84%
10 days in, feeling
good, good, good.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.390 align:middle line:84%
PR just made us some
chia porridge right here.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.612 align:middle line:90%
Yum, yum, yum!

00:38:05.612 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>> That is going to ignite
my life until around 2:00

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.480 align:middle line:84%
o'clock, in which time I will
consume something else that

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:84%
will make me sustain
till about 5:00 o'clock.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

Lindsay doesn't like it.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I do.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I actually like this
better than yesterday's

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>> That's because Paul made it.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:34.748 align:middle line:84%
>> What we just got through
doing, Lindsay, Seth, you,

00:38:34.748 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and I, we just got
through doing a workout.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And this has been one
week exactly since we

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.390 align:middle line:90%
met in Stephenville Texas.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And today, after one week--

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Seth went through a
really intense detox.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.980 align:middle line:84%
He e-mailed me a couple
of times, and he said,

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.940 align:middle line:90%
my head is pounding.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I feel like crap.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Is this normal?

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.120 align:middle line:90%
And it is for him.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
He is really fast metabolism,
so his cleansing period

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.560 align:middle line:84%
was really fast
and really intense.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.977 align:middle line:84%
But he had a breakthrough, and
he's felt better and better

00:38:57.977 --> 00:38:59.642 align:middle line:90%
since then.

00:38:59.642 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Initially we could do about
10, and we've worked our way up

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.260 align:middle line:90%
to 15 on the core exercises.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And after one week, it
wasn't a perfect attempt

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.900 align:middle line:84%
at a Superman push up, but
he got his entire body off.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So it was one legal
Superman push up.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, for most people
they can never do that,

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and after one week of eating
raw foods, and training,

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and even the positive mindset--
getting out here in the sun--

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:90%
he did one.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's just going to be
continual progress forward.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.738 align:middle line:84%
We're going to help him with
some of his shoulder injuries,

00:39:27.738 --> 00:39:31.518 align:middle line:84%
tighten this core up,
and I look forward

00:39:31.518 --> 00:39:32.810 align:middle line:90%
to seeing the further progress.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And Lindsay, she kind
of puts everybody

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to shame with her perfect
form and perfect body,

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:84%
so we're just trying
to keep up with that.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Another use of coconut
oil is very helpful,

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:84%

demonstrate is topical

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it goes in the hair too.

He ain't even scared.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.835 align:middle line:90%
>> In the hair, in the eyes.

00:39:54.835 --> 00:39:57.210 align:middle line:84%
You can actually put coconut
oil in your eyes, your lips,

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.930 align:middle line:90%
your cheeks, your gums.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:90%

property that you
could possibly want.

And it's apple cider vinegar,

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and onion.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.730 align:middle line:90%
You let it marinate.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.040 align:middle line:84%

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And we like him.

We give him cooked

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.310 align:middle line:90%

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.480 align:middle line:84%

and algaes, and
spirulina, chlorella.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> What I do with my kids--

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.545 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to buy
these tortilla chips,

00:45:37.545 --> 00:45:40.170 align:middle line:84%
these are nacho things that all
the kids were eating in school.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So I said my daughter,
sure, show me the packaging.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:44.560 align:middle line:90%
It had 35 to 40 ingredients.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if
you can understand

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.480 align:middle line:84%
what are these 15 of
these ingredients are,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.278 align:middle line:90%
you can eat it.

00:45:50.278 --> 00:45:52.070 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't even
pronounce it, let alone--

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:52.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So I took her to
Whole Foods and I

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.120 align:middle line:84%
said, which one looks the
closest to that bag of chips?

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.280 align:middle line:84%
We picked three different
kinds of cheddar chips,

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and it had six ingredients in
it, and all the ones she knew.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Bell pepper, whatever
it was, she tasted it,

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:90%
and it tasted exactly the same.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.940 align:middle line:84%
The idea is, you don't have
to deny yourself things

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that you want,
but see if there's

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:90%
a better way in attaining it.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.255 align:middle line:84%
>> And also I love to
eat things that are raw.

00:46:17.255 --> 00:46:18.055 align:middle line:90%
>> You do?

00:46:18.055 --> 00:46:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, what do you mean by raw?

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Like raw vegetables.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more nutritious,
and when you cook it,

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.580 align:middle line:84%
it loses a lot of
those nutrients.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:33.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like to eat the
raw tomatoes instead of cooked,

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.640 align:middle line:90%
but not raw eggs.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:46:36.495 --> 00:46:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they might
have salmonella.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're right.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.270 align:middle line:84%

to do just about
everything, trying

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to create a sustainable-type
system with everything

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.010 align:middle line:84%
from vegetables, fruit, to
eggs, some goat meat, to beef.

>> The reason I
really appreciate Ty,

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.790 align:middle line:84%
is he came to Stephenville
the other day, gave a speech,

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:18.090 align:middle line:90%
gave some of us food.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
we're looking to promote,

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.360 align:middle line:84%
is that connection
to the local farmer,

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and just shortening the distance
between where the food is grown

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.960 align:middle line:90%
and where you're eating it.

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, if you're just
eating McDonald's yesterday,

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:34.840 align:middle line:84%
you go into a juice
fast today, for example,

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.700 align:middle line:84%
you do that for a few days,
you're really not sure what

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that's going to look
like on the other side.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So when you develop that nice
foundation of raw food balance

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.760 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle, you switch
and maybe have a juice

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.520 align:middle line:84%
fast later on,
somewhere midway, just

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to see what it's like
for a couple of days,

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.390 align:middle line:90%

00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Watermelon.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It has a pleasant aroma.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.540 align:middle line:84%

just kind of splashes in there.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.390 align:middle line:90%

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Day five of my
seven day juicing,

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and I feel a lot
better this morning.

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about getting
some more juice going.

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about hitting
the next few days.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:29.530 align:middle line:90%
So pretty, pretty good.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out Lindsay
and Paul were right.

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Days six and seven,
they were amazing.

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I felt unbelievable
on the juice.

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.762 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
it, I was really

00:57:39.762 --> 00:57:41.470 align:middle line:84%
hoping Russell was
going to be right too,

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:44.010 align:middle line:84%
about this whole
hydrocolonic thing.

having colonic irrigation,

which two words,
"colonic" and "irrigation"

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:52.175 align:middle line:84%

of many people.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I think it's
something I've done before

00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and I've got a
huge benefit from.

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:03.635 align:middle line:84%
Taking care of your
intestines and your bowel

00:58:03.635 --> 00:58:06.910 align:middle line:84%
is one of the best things you
can do for your body, you know?

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, you really got the food
sorted, you're hydrated,

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.390 align:middle line:84%
you're working out, so it's just
really building up the layers

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.542 align:middle line:84%
and doing this kind
of stuff as well.

00:58:17.542 --> 00:58:18.750 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling about it?

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:19.845 align:middle line:90%

Well, I'm glad to hear it.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't say enough
good things about it.

00:58:49.216 --> 00:58:51.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lubricate this--

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.717 align:middle line:84%
and it's all
vegetable-based-- and then

00:58:52.717 --> 00:58:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pull that out
and attach this to back here.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:59.363 align:middle line:84%
And then, this clean water
source is going to go here.

>> So this is what is
actually being inserted?

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

And for guys, this is the
most comfortable system.

It's only 2 and 1/2 inches.

>> OK, so how far did she say?

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:12.032 align:middle line:90%
Two-- two inches!

>> The water's flowing.

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:14.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I feel something now.

00:59:14.415 --> 00:59:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It probably won't start
coming out right away.

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us something.

00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very odd.

>> Well, this is how we're
accountable for what we eat.

00:59:24.896 --> 00:59:29.380 align:middle line:84%

it around and feel

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.560 align:middle line:90%
the toxicity of what you eat.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, oh!

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh!

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it an explosion?

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just sludgy, heavy.

>> Oh, my!

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Cemented.

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Did it come out, or did
it come out on the table.

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The white foam
there is yeast.

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's just
in the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it is?

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.283 align:middle line:90%
It felt like it was coming out--

00:59:45.283 --> 00:59:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The fermentation of the food
that sits in the gut gets all--

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like the foam on a

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:51.960 align:middle line:90%
of the tube.

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The feeling I got afterwards?

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:59.100 align:middle line:84%
[WHISTLES] I felt light as
a feather after that oh boy.

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.660 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.280 align:middle line:90%
About halfway through day 34.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Just finished my juice fast, and
I think I'm on the homestretch.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what,
I'm happy that I'm

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.510 align:middle line:90%
on this side of it.

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:15.240 align:middle line:84%
The first week was incredibly
difficult. About day six,

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I went into somewhere like
the other days kind of gelled

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.290 align:middle line:90%
together.

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But went into a serious
unbelievable detox,

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure actually
translates well on film,

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.700 align:middle line:90%
but I felt like I was dying.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.667 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to scare
everybody away from doing this

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:34.470 align:middle line:84%
themselves, but along
with the detox physically,

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
things that came up,

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:39.120 align:middle line:84%
psychological things that
started unrooting themselves.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like
I was cleaning up

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of emotional,
a lot of mental,

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of non-physical
things that were happening.

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Relationships--

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.520 align:middle line:90%
It was actually a dark time.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like I had
to go through the tunnel,

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:57.240 align:middle line:84%
because on the other side of
that, when that detox was over,

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
it I went from the lowest
low, almost wanting

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:01.112 align:middle line:90%
to quit this whole thing--

01:01:01.112 --> 01:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
hands down, I was
done, I was ready to go

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor, the hospital, get
me some help, whatever it is--

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
right when I didn't think
I could handle any more,

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I felt something that
I've never felt before.

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
It was the most
unbelievable experience

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:16.870 align:middle line:90%
of just a weight lifting off me.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.037 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I'd been walking
around with 500 pounds.

01:01:19.037 --> 01:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So not only did all that
sludge that I had worked up

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
from emotional sludge, and
relationship sludge, and all

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.620 align:middle line:90%
that stuff, it was gone!

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And not only did I physically
feel like I could fly,

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there was nothing
I couldn't accomplish.

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
No goal was too big, no
mission was too impossible.

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the case was,
positivity out of your brain.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.682 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was impossible.

01:01:45.682 --> 01:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, that was the most
exciting part for me,

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
it was that I felt great, but
at the same time, mentally,

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally,
and spiritually,

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and relationaly, what these
people said at the Longevity

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Now Conference was
actually happening,

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and all this is
doing is exciting

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%
me for the next 30 days.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't wait
to see what happens.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.707 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm growing
testosterone again.

01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I feel like more of a man.

01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:10.680 align:middle line:90%
I feel higher energy levels.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm sleeping less at night.

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm jumping in bed
with my wife more.

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know,
it's 34 days in,

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and if it keeps
crescendoing like this,

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to literally
be Superman by 60 days.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
have to start filming me

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.060 align:middle line:84%
as I fly from tree to
tree, because that's

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.185 align:middle line:90%
what I'm going to be doing.

01:02:28.185 --> 01:02:30.250 align:middle line:90%


01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.576 align:middle line:84%
Finishing up the morning
smoothie for all of us here.

01:02:33.576 --> 01:02:34.920 align:middle line:90%
A lot of goodies in here.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw in
a little coconut water.

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:42.145 align:middle line:84%
This is a smoothie designed
by none other than Paul

01:02:42.145 --> 01:02:42.945 align:middle line:90%
"the beast" Risse.

01:02:42.945 --> 01:02:47.020 align:middle line:90%


01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got blueberries in
here, we've got mangoes,

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
we've got strawberries, we've
got honey, we've got spinach,

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
we got hemp seed,
we got bananas.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
That's called
collaborative smoothie.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Good work, sir.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, good job.

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul has brought something
to my attention that is really

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:08.470 align:middle line:84%
useful on a daily
basis, and that is,

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:11.098 align:middle line:84%
if you start the day
off with a compliment--

01:03:11.098 --> 01:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't even matter
what the compliment is, just

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.348 align:middle line:84%
start the day off with
a compliment first thing

01:03:15.348 --> 01:03:16.380 align:middle line:90%
in the morning--

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
it gets the day off
to a good start.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.985 align:middle line:90%
>> I like your glasses.

01:03:19.985 --> 01:03:20.785 align:middle line:90%

excellent job shooting today,

wear those glasses, Seth.

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I'm pulling
it off pretty well.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> And the headband, Paul?

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Amazing!

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
It's an old T-shirt.

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:34.092 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what to do with
it, and now it's a headband.

01:03:34.092 --> 01:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you've done a great
job being the female in this

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:36.640 align:middle line:90%

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Lindsay has made us

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Lindsay, you've made me
appreciate femininity in its

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.020 align:middle line:90%
purest form.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> There we go.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
What about us?

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You guys are all great--

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:47.440 align:middle line:90%
men.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.310 align:middle line:90%

>> OK.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we started realizing
was that really no matter where

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:00.220 align:middle line:84%
you are, if you look close
enough you can find a little

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.840 align:middle line:90%
treasure trove of goodness.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Like this place, the Main
Street Cafe in Decatur, Texas.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the town I grew up in,
and I didn't know this existed.

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
They grow all their own food
that they use in the kitchen.

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Man!

01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
The food was fresh, and
so tasty and delightful.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Is a your little salad area.

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>> This is part of it, and then
we just walked by some more

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.110 align:middle line:90%
tomatoes and onions.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
This is pretty well done.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the heat set in now,
so our lettuce is bolting.

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:31.037 align:middle line:84%
People in small little
zero lot line houses

01:04:31.037 --> 01:04:32.620 align:middle line:84%
can have a vegetable
garden like this.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> We also have things done
in containers so people

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
on balconies or
apartment complex,

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:39.652 align:middle line:90%
you can grow even in containers.

01:04:39.652 --> 01:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So really, the excuse
that, I don't have any room,

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860 align:middle line:90%
is just that.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And all it takes is that
person to try a tomato right

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
off the vine, and they'll
never buy another tomato from

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Walmart.

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And you use a lot of
this in your cuisine.

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> We use everything.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything that will
grow out here is used.

01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's thrown in a dish.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So whatever's in season,
that's what you're going

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:57.380 align:middle line:90%
to get.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
some squash tomorrow.

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Swiss chard
is still good,

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.055 align:middle line:90%
>> That's as big I've seen.

01:05:02.055 --> 01:05:03.015 align:middle line:90%
It's organic.

01:05:03.015 --> 01:05:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Individual leaves.

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:04.100 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

via penny Shelton that is.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So packed our backpacks,
jumped on a plane,

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and off we went,
California bound.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%

It's a little mecca
of life right here.

01:05:26.375 --> 01:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Got all kinds of goodies, a
fully-equipped raw kitchen.

We are set up!

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm so delighted
to have you guys here.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I had severe adrenal
fatigue and hypothyroidism,

01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and raw food and the help my
doctor pretty much cured--

01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:42.050 align:middle line:90%
there's so many noises--

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:44.330 align:middle line:90%
pretty much cured what I had.

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But after a year of not
eating raw food again,

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel well.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
tired, I was exhausted,

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.070 align:middle line:90%
I was just worn down.

01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Why are you laughing?

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.882 align:middle line:84%
Next time, I'm going to film
you getting your blood drawn.

01:14:57.882 --> 01:15:00.654 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

01:15:00.654 --> 01:15:02.970 align:middle line:90%


01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
what's wrong with you.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:06.810 align:middle line:90%
So what?

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:08.240 align:middle line:90%
You were 172 before, huh?

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.210 align:middle line:90%


01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> 162.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Dang.

01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a lot of
weight on your frame.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a small victory
to take away from today.

01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:28.140 align:middle line:84%
With my blood drawn, and very,
very dramatically, I might add,

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:32.533 align:middle line:84%
I'm left to ponder this
experiment in the last 60 days

01:15:32.533 --> 01:15:33.450 align:middle line:90%
that I've embarked on.

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And the more I think
about it, the more

01:15:35.370 --> 01:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I realize it's not really at
all about those test results.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.280 align:middle line:84%
While I hope that the test
results come back good,

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I do realize that it's not all
about what the doctor says,

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:48.990 align:middle line:84%
it's what I say, and my life
has changed significantly

01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:51.660 align:middle line:90%
for the better.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.122 align:middle line:84%
Along the journey, I met
some pretty amazing people,

01:15:54.122 --> 01:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and without them, I
don't know if I could

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:57.323 align:middle line:90%
have done this whole thing.

01:15:57.323 --> 01:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
You have people
like the RawBrahs,

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
whose energy is boundless
and completely infectious.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
When you're around the RawBrahs,
you can't help but smile.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
We can't forget Dara Dubinet,
who welcomed us into her home

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
without knowing us, and
then instantly became

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:11.760 align:middle line:90%
a raw food muse.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what, her mushroom
tonics are something special.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Sir Russell
James, who hails from England.

01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
This guy's wit, food,
and accent are exquisite.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But above that, he's
a wonderful friend,

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.810 align:middle line:90%
and, man, am I glad I know him.

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Paul Risse, encyclopedia
of all things good.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.280 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing guy.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Just a soft, still
presence, and I'm

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.930 align:middle line:84%
very pleased that I get to call
you a friend for a long time.

01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
lovely penny Shelton,

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
who was always there to
help out with anything.

01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean what a servant's
heart this lady has.

01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention the fact
that her gorgeous hair

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and her dashing blue eyes match
her unbelievably beautiful

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:51.920 align:middle line:90%
heart.

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Dave the Raw Food
Trucker, thank you

01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
so much for your diligent
work in connecting us to some

01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:58.650 align:middle line:90%
of the top people in raw food.

01:16:58.650 --> 01:16:59.982 align:middle line:90%
You're an amazing guy.

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And I could go on, and on,
and on with all the people

01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:04.813 align:middle line:84%
that I've met, but you've
touched my life immensely,

01:17:04.813 --> 01:17:05.980 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very, very thankful.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.790 align:middle line:90%


01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:13.810 align:middle line:84%
We've got a few
points of interest.

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
You were deficient in
B12 when you started,

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
which isn't that surprising,
a lot of people are.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't get worse, but
it also didn't get better.

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So the big claim with vegan
diet and raw diet is that B12

01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:28.800 align:middle line:90%
just goes to the toilet.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.920 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't actually.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.720 align:middle line:90%
It stayed.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It stayed almost
exactly the same.

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
The things that did improve
on the micronutrient side

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.690 align:middle line:84%
were your zinc
went from deficient

01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:41.020 align:middle line:90%
to normal, and your magnesium.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are two minerals that are
incredibly important in terms

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
of reactions in your body, so
pretty cool to see magnesium

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:52.030 align:middle line:90%
and zinc go to normal.

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And the other vitamins that
I was deficient in were D and C.

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And not only did they
go up, they went way up.

01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one that you guys
will be most excited about is

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
the Spectrox test, which is
a measurement of antioxidant

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.550 align:middle line:90%
activity.

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is, how does your
body handle oxidative stress,

01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:12.980 align:middle line:84%
which you were deficient
in when you started.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was low in the ability
to get rid of free radicals,

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and toxins, and stuff
that were happening.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So part of this, my body was
not getting rid of the things

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:22.010 align:middle line:90%
it needed to get rid of?

01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Not adequately.

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have the
capacity to do that.

01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And now you do.

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And it went past the normal--

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Past the normal.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Past adequate to
more than adequate.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
My main concern is
going into this where

01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:37.030 align:middle line:90%
obviously the concern you had.

01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I had concern with the
motility of my sperm,

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:43.100 align:middle line:90%
and also the testosterone level.

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's address that.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that that is probably
the most incredible improvement

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:54.425 align:middle line:84%
that you made, an almost
calls into question,

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.300 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Because as you recall, when
we tested you initially,

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
your testosterone
levels were very low.

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Your initial total
testosterone was 146, which

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:08.590 align:middle line:90%
by definition is hypogonadism.

01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Your free and weakly
bound testosterone levels,

01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
which is honestly a more
important number, was 24.

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Also very low.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Your total went from 146 to 371.

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:23.482 align:middle line:84%
So it went up about
more than 100%.

01:19:23.482 --> 01:19:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, did you guys catch that?

01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:27.910 align:middle line:90%
100% increase in 60 days.

01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
That would put the score at
Average Joe, one, hypogonadism,

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.580 align:middle line:90%
zero.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And that takes it
into the normal range.

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:37.360 align:middle line:90%
So you went from--

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> So they do work, essentially.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, you're
making testosterone, at least.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And you were making
a little bit before.

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
You're free plus
weakly-bound, which

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
is honestly the more important
number, went from 24 to 81.

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So that went up
by more than 200%.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Boom!

01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:58.420 align:middle line:90%
200%.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.362 align:middle line:90%
Take that hypogonadism.

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
That's Average Joe,
two, hypogonadism, zero.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's just say, it
is primary hypogonadism,

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and your testes aren't
making testosterone.

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Is changing your diet
going to fix that?

01:20:11.230 --> 01:20:12.742 align:middle line:90%
In my opinion, no.

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:14.200 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was,
OK, I mean, you

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
can do whatever you
want with your diet,

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going
to normalize this.

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was my honest opinion.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Had I not seen, been
present, drawn these labs,

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
sent them off with
our lab myself,

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the numbers really are dramatic
enough to even question it.

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:36.983 align:middle line:84%
Is this something like did
you draw your wife's blood

01:20:36.983 --> 01:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and send it in for a
testosterone level?

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> The first time?

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, was something else
going on trying to fabricate

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.480 align:middle line:90%
some numbers?

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But I can say with all
honesty and integrity

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that I saw this blood drawn,
we sent it to our lab,

01:20:52.730 --> 01:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and outside of some lab
error, this is legitimate.

01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's huge.

01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:00.000 align:middle line:90%
What about the motility?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, mortality
is a measure of activity

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:02.920 align:middle line:90%
of your sperm.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
If your sperm is not motile,
then it's not going anywhere.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to do the job.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're motility
improved by 33%.

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I honestly would expect these
numbers and results to be

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:17.020 align:middle line:90%
even better as time went on.

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.550 align:middle line:90%
This is 60 short days.

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm honestly very
surprised that at 60 days,

01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
you were able to eliminate
a couple deficiencies,

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and then obviously the
miracle testosterone levels.

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:31.142 align:middle line:84%
But I can say in this
case, in this one person,

01:21:31.142 --> 01:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I've seen something pretty
dramatic and amazing

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.380 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't expect.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting and
warrants looking into it more.

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I would love to have 100
people do the same thing,

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what the
results are and confirm it.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I may be the next contestant.

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:46.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I first met Seth
earlier this year,

01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and we just became
instant friends basically.

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
anything about me,

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.995 align:middle line:84%
and we ended up talking,
and I shared with him

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:59.245 align:middle line:84%
that I'd written a book
called Raw Food Cleanse, which

01:21:59.245 --> 01:22:01.660 align:middle line:90%
he wanted me to show.

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning,
I really didn't

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
perceive him to be someone who
had a lot of health problems.

01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he wasn't obese.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But then after hearing
about the test results

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and finding out
that there actually

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
were some real
legitimate issues,

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and then watching how just
making that shift in his diet

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
has made such a tremendous
impact on the test results,

01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just blown me away.

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we have
here is completion.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.560 align:middle line:90%
This is my exit interview.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, that in
the beginning of this process,

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought probably food would
clear up some of the problems.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought obviously food would
do something positive for me,

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:50.220 align:middle line:84%
but this documentary
and this journey

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
became so much
more than the food.

01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:57.100 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, the test
results, they were huge.

01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:57.900 align:middle line:90%
They were amazing.

01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy that I had such
low testosterone, because

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
of the result of
showing 60 days later,

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
of nothing but raw
living foods, was

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
able to create a 150%, 200%
increase in testosterone,

01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:11.010 align:middle line:90%
that blows my mind.

01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:14.013 align:middle line:84%
That's nothing
short of a miracle.

01:23:14.013 --> 01:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a miracle,
because it's the food,

01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's wonderful.

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Then the other test
results that increased,

01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know it's true,
because I feel amazing.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I feel 1,000 times better.

01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:26.173 align:middle line:84%
There was a discovery period,
not only with learning

01:23:26.173 --> 01:23:28.590 align:middle line:84%
I had low testosterone, and
learning that my body couldn't

01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:31.950 align:middle line:84%
get rid of free radicals, but
there was a discovery process

01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:33.090 align:middle line:90%
within my relationships.

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I started realizing I had
issues with certain people,

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and there was anger problems
that I never knew I had.

01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of that stuff, while the
discovery part was difficult--

01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
it was hard to hear that
I had low testosterone.

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It was hard to hear that
I had anger problems.

01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But once I realized
that I could fix that,

01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
being in this mindset,
the mental capacity that I

01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
had because of
what I was eating,

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.700 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to handle every
situation that I had.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I was healed of anger, healed
of relationship problems.

01:24:06.210 --> 01:24:09.322 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge
that I garnered

01:24:09.322 --> 01:24:11.280 align:middle line:84%
from people like Paul
Risse, and Russell James,

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.387 align:middle line:84%
and Penny Shelton, Dave the Raw
Food Trucker, these people that

01:24:16.387 --> 01:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
came into my life through this
process that I'll never forget,

01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and that absolutely
changed my life.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but the community

01:24:23.190 --> 01:24:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that I was immersed in.

01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:27.030 align:middle line:84%
All the things I learned at
the Longevity Now Conference

01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:28.280 align:middle line:90%
at the very beginning of this.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
All of that came
completely to fruition.

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Those people are not lying.

01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:33.430 align:middle line:90%
They're telling you the truth.

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe that once I took
a step to better my life,

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and the step I took
was changing my diet

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and changing what
I put into my body,

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
once I had made that mental
and that commitment to do

01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:46.560 align:middle line:90%
that, it was a domino effect.

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Things started happening
to me that were amazing

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and were very positive.

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I challenge all of the Average

feel like you're actually

moving towards the perfect
version of yourself,

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.535 align:middle line:84%
make a commitment to
eating raw living foods.

01:25:04.535 --> 01:25:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It will clean out your body,
it will clean out your mind,

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
it'll clean out
your relationships.

01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Things will surface, and
then you can wipe them away.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:11.940 align:middle line:90%
So I challenge you.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.838 align:middle line:84%
I believe raw food is a
perfect tool for cleansing.

01:25:14.838 --> 01:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
do is challenge you

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to any number of
days, whether it's 15,

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
30, 60, whatever you
feel led to do, do that.

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Make that commitment, challenge
yourself to cleanse your body,

01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and in turn your mind,
body, soul, spirit, all

01:25:29.490 --> 01:25:30.600 align:middle line:90%
that will follow.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe in this
wholeheartedly.

01:25:32.190 --> 01:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So I challenge you
to do that, and I

01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
believe that you
will start to become

01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:38.950 align:middle line:90%
the best person you can be.

>> It really changed our
lives for the better.

01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It cleansed us out
from the inside,

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and is shown
through the outside.

01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
It cleans us physically,
spiritually, mentally.

>> I'm probably in the
best shape I've ever been.

01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I used to do soccer, and
I feel like I'm in way better

01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%

was playing soccer.

your body what it needs

even more energy.

up to me and saying, wow,

you look great.

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:47.620 align:middle line:90%
