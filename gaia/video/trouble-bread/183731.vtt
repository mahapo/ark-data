>> People have been eating bread
for 10,000 years as the staple,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
as a cornerstone of
every single meal.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Bread is the foundation
of our daily meals.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one
food on the tables

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:90%
of people all over the world.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Very good reason-- it's
the most economical source

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:90%
of the elements needed.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I grew up eating
sandwiches, pizza, toast,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of bread.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.866 align:middle line:90%
And I had no problem eating it.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The calories from wheat makes
up about a fifth of our diet.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not all in bread.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, wheat is in
pastries and snacks,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's an additive in lots
of food, but it's a fifth.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:90%
It's 20%.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a big player.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But for me,
something changed.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
This is me three years ago, back
when I was able to eat bread.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
These days, whenever I
eat wheat, I feel sick.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Until recently, the idea of
not being able to eat bread

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
was crazy, but
the wheat products

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:84%
you find in today's
grocery stores

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
are more difficult to
digest, and it's all thanks

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:90%
to this thing called gluten.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Gluten is essentially
these two kinds of proteins,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
gliadin and glutenin, that when
wet, combine to form a mesh.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And that mesh has
certain qualities

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that are remarkable,
chief among them the fact

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:90%
that it holds air.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:90%
It forms little pockets--

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
balloons-- that will get
bigger and bigger and bigger,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
because gluten is very
stretchy, and so it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:90%
makes really good bread.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But when I eat bread, it
feels like I have a hangover.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I get a stomach ache,
nausea, exhaustion.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like my body is trying
to fight off the bread.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Since I live in the
bread basket of America,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I decided this is the best
place to look for options,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.983 align:middle line:90%
and so I got started.

>> And we do custom
blend for everything.

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
best snack food in the
organic, gluten-free portable.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems strange to me
that wheat has gone through--

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
very recently-- a real fear
of it not just for calories,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:90%
but for intolerance.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Gluten intolerance has
become this enormous obsession.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Gluten free advertisement
on a product

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
effective ways

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:90%
to sell a product, apparently.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
When we see gluten
free, that connotes

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.600 align:middle line:90%
healthy in the grocery store.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But it is not
necessarily the case,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of really
cruddy gluten free products.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:90%
You've got to try it.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The place was packed,
and the food was terrible.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
All the snacks there
were way too sugary,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up with
a stomach ache.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> This one is gluten
free, grain free, soy free,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.516 align:middle line:90%
vegetarian.

>> Is everyone complaining
of gluten intolerance really

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
having a physiological
reaction to it?

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:90%
I kind of doubt it.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people who
really struggle with this.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to suggest
it's all in their head.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.225 align:middle line:84%
>> But it could
all be in my head.

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It could all be
in your head, yes.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a possibility.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So I could be imagining this
whole gluten intolerance thing.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But there is
another possibility.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.871 align:middle line:90%
What if I have celiac disease?

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Celiac disease is an
autoimmune disease in which

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
the lining of the
intestine-- the villi--

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:90%
begin attacking themselves.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And people lose the ability
to absorb nutrients,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:90%
and essentially starve.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> 130 people or so are thought
to be at risk for celiac

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:90%
One out of 130 is incredible.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.005 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I decided to
get tested for celiac.

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Celiac disease is
four times more common

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:90%
than it was in the 1950s.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But allergies have
increased, too.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So maybe gluten
tolerance is part

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
of a bigger story about
how our immune systems just

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:90%
don't work like they used to.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.062 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Maggie.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.598 align:middle line:90%
This is Lynn Ann Jacob.

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm a nurse at the Tang
Center with Vicki Summer.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
You had some tests
done on the 25th,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and you called for the results
and they're both negative.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So I didn't have celiac,
which means I probably have

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
this kind of gluten intolerance
that nobody really understands.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, my gut
gets inflamed when

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I eat gluten, which causes
my stomach aches, headaches,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
and other delightful symptoms.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
A friend suggested that if I
wanted to find a real wheat

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
bread I could eat,
maybe I should just

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.848 align:middle line:90%
start at the beginning.

00:05:43.848 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a lot of just
so stories about the origin

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:90%
of bread.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there's
an aha moment where

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
everyone's eating flatbread
and suddenly it poofs up

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and someone says, oh,
I have risen bread.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
a long, let's say,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
spectrum of degrees until you
get to a really poofy loaf

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:90%
like we have.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
The first bread is
from the Sumerians

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
in what's now Iraq,
probably somewhere

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:90%
around 10,000 years ago.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians and Sumerians
are definitely the first,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
because wheat is indigenous
to the Middle East.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
In the wild state, the
ancestors of wheat--

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
monococcus has one grain per
stalk, so you know, we have 20,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.115 align:middle line:90%
30 now.

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> One grain to 30 per
stalk is a big change.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.488 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to see it for myself.

00:06:50.488 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Wheat.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And to grow the wheat,
it takes a farmer.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
From New York to Michigan
to Nebraska to Oregon

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and from the Dakotas down
through all the great grain

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
belt, 1,000, 10,000
and 100,000 wheat

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
farmers grow the
finest of wheat.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.221 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> In this country, almost all
bread is made from this hard

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:90%
red winter wheat.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:84%
There's some indication--
some anecdotal indication--

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
that there is a link between
this hard wheat and people's

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
gluten problems, but that
could well be circumstantial.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> There is more gluten in
wheat now than there used to be.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We breed specifically
for gluten.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Bakers prefer wheat with
more gluten because it's easier

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:90%
to bake with.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if more gluten
meant more stomachaches,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
but maybe I could eat bread made
from older heritage wheats that

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:90%
have less gluten.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The main reason that we
don't grow much variety and that

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
we've gotten to a state of
monoculture with wheat in this

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:84%
country has everything
to do with yield.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The old heritage wheats,
the yields are just lower.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.158 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these heritage
varieties are old.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe you
have a disease problem.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.617 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they grow tall
and they fall down.

00:08:15.617 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they thrash
out in the wind.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just obviously
more complicated,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's a premium product.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:90%
There's a specialty product.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like $100
bottle of wine or something.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> $100 bottle of wine?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I could see the heritage
wheats were just too expensive,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and then I was pretty much stuck
with hard red winter wheat.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I started to think maybe
it wasn't the plant itself,

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.931 align:middle line:84%
but the way we process
it that's changed.

00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a hand kern.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much
the same technology

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.037 align:middle line:90%
as you'd find in 10,000 BC.

00:08:55.037 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is I've got
a little plastic knob on mine,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:90%
but otherwise, it's the same.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Just turns around.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.868 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, the wheat will
come out right about there.

00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:06.326 align:middle line:90%
See it coming out there?

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:11.672 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.672 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to
do next is sift it,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to put it over this--

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:90%
it's basically just a screen.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.556 align:middle line:84%
Fits on top of
this bowl, and I'm

00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:90%
going to pour it in this way.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:35.012 align:middle line:84%
And that will remove
all the larger bits.

00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to go like that.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
You can see I've got some
of the chaff in there,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and I've got a finer wheat here.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But the technology-- when
you need to feed more and more

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
people-- gets bigger, and you
need to go to different energy

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:90%
sources.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So a huge millstone
makes a lot more sense.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It's more efficient,
and in ancient times,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to feed their armies,
would have had to grind

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:90%
immense quantities of grain.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
A waterwheel is another
1,000 years later,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
so that technology
comes in around 1000 AD.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.806 align:middle line:84%
By the early 19th century, there
is roller technology in place.

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So if milling technology
has changed so much,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what that means
for the wheat itself?

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, wheat is good for us
if we eat it in its whole grain

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:84%
All parts of the seed have
everything a life needs.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Has bran-- which the
fiber is a very good food

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:90%
for the microbes in your body.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Has energy in the endosperm.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It has various oils
in the germ, so it's

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:90%
an incredibly nutritious food.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But I hasten to add,
this is not how Americans

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.142 align:middle line:90%
eat bread or wheat anymore.

00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:90%
95%-- at least--

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:84%
of the wheat that we
eat has been refined,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
which is to say the
bran and the germ--

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:90%
the two healthiest parts--

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:90%
are discarded.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.525 align:middle line:84%
And we pig out on
the white flour.

00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> That bran and germ helped
us digest gluten in the first

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Without it, we're left with
this starchy white flour,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and it may be that the more of
it we eat, the more sensitive

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:90%
we get.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> What happens
to the good part?

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, ironically enough, we
feed it to animals on feedlots,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and we sell it
back to people who

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
are starved of nutrients
in the form of vitamins.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a great business model,
but it's terrible nutrition.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Originally,
this didn't happen.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Originally, every little
town had its own mill there.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It was usually a stone
mill, and you'd go down

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and you'd pick up
a bag of flour.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.340 align:middle line:84%
That would be whole ground, and
so it had all the nutrition.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:84%
The downside is it had all
this-- the natural oils

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that are in the
wheat germ itself,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and those oils will
go bad over time.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:90%
They become rancid.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
With the growth of our
nation and the food industry,

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:84%
started shipping
products everywhere

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:90%
over the United States.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:90%
That became untenable.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.112 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody
figured out how to do it.

00:12:21.112 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
They invented these things
called roller mills.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:84%
It breaks off the bran and the
germ, and that's thrown out.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Now you had this
white flour that you

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:90%
could ship all over the world.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't go bad.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the biggest
changes to the human diet

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:90%
since cooking was invented.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Except that white
flour is making me sick.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:90%
What about whole wheat flour?

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
If all the parts of the
wheat seed are still there,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.324 align:middle line:84%
then shouldn't whole
wheat flour be OK for me?

00:12:54.324 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> There is another
shortcut that one can take.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
If you want to claim that
your product is whole grain

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
but you have to buy flour from
the commercial roller mill

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
industry, you have
the capability

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to add back your own bran or
your own part of the germ.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's done, to some degree.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Some places add just the bran
back so that they can then

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
claim, oh, this is whole grain.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:90%
But is it really whole grain?

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.985 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So whole wheat flour is
actually just white flour with

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:90%
some bran thrown back in?

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Then, I found out that this
way of milling and marketing

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:90%
is very American.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And they don't do
that in Europe?

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't do that in Europe.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they do?

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:45.362 align:middle line:84%
>> They take the whole grain,
and they mill it whole.

00:13:45.362 --> 00:13:47.897 align:middle line:84%
>> So they don't take the
bran out and the germ.

00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't take the
bran or the germ out.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
What they do is,
they mill it whole

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and then if there's large
particles, they sift it off.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> This whole milling--

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.362 align:middle line:84%
or stone ground milling,
as it's called--

00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:84%
is basically what
we had been doing

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
for centuries before
roller mills were invented.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And in some places,
they still use it.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If you go to France and you
get your breads from a baker

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
that uses whole milled flour,
or flour that's been processed

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:84%
through whole milling,
then you can eat it.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> This may sound crazy, but
what Mark was saying seemed

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:90%
to make sense.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
When I lived in France
three years ago,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I had no problem eating bread.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I got
back to the States,

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:90%
I knew something was wrong.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be sure that this
was the cause of my intolerance,

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but what I did know was
that whole wheat wasn't

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:90%
as whole as I thought it was.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I still
wasn't quite sure

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.516 align:middle line:84%
what the whole
wheat label meant.

00:14:49.516 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The FDA allows for whole
wheat statements of health

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to be added to products as long
as 51% or more of the flour

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.450 align:middle line:90%
that's used is whole grain.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a bread
made from 51% whole wheat

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and 49% all purpose.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
You're still losing a
lot of those nutrients.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the store and
you buy a loaf of bread that

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
says whole wheat, you're really
not sure what you're getting.

>> I used to buy white bread.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Look, this one is wheat, but
it's not 100% whole wheat.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Because my budget, I have to
go for the best, but cheaper.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:84%
This one, that is
the better kind

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
of bread with 100%
whole wheat on it.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:90%

out on the street,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%

do you want this?

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:90%
They're gonna take this one.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What the label doesn't say is
how much of that bread is 100%

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:90%
whole wheat.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The industry requires only that
the first ingredient has to be,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:84%
which wouldn't be a big
deal if we were sticking

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:90%
to the traditional recipe.

from just those three simple

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
ingredients, flour,
water, and salt?

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.798 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.798 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We'd taken this very healthy
food and we'd processed it

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it was
not only less nutritious,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:90%

So the solution they hit on is
a classic capitalist solution.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Rather than return to
whole grain milling,

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
and say, work on improving
the quality of that,

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
they figured out that they
could just add these missing

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:90%
vitamins back, and they did.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%

that they had extra nutrients

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think by the middle
of the 20th century

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
when people think of bread,
they think baked in a loaf

poofy, that's got,

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, conditioners and
bromates to make it whiter,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:90%
and additives.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Because Wonder soft whipped
bread is made from batter,

>> White bread has always
been a marker of status

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:84%
because you're throwing
away a lot of the bread,

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
would make bread brown.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And interesting, so whiteness
always equated with wealth.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that changes only

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.107 align:middle line:84%
when the technology is able to
make mass produced white bread,

00:18:26.107 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:90%
and then it becomes cheap.

The industrial Wonder Bread
kind of sliced white bread

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
then becomes a mark of
being low class, which

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:90%
is totally, totally, opposite.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.478 align:middle line:90%
Switches entirely.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Chad wanted to make a
good loaf of wheat bread

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:84%
that was digestible, because
his wife Elizabeth was

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:90%
gluten intolerant.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I found out that the couple
had once spent a year in France

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
where Elizabeth had no problem
eating bread, just like me.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I had to know how a woman
with gluten intolerance

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.345 align:middle line:84%
was married to a man who made
his living working with bread.

00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There was one time when
I remember you eating, like,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
half of a loaf, and I
thought it was crazy.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And you had no effects at all.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:90%
But then, you wouldn't really--

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.414 align:middle line:84%
that was kind of a one-time
thing that happened.

00:19:36.414 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Half a loaf of--

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It was made--

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.195 align:middle line:84%
it was a loaf of emmer, which
is a very old wheat variety.

00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I should have
seen this one coming.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Emmer?

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
This was that $100 bottle
of wine answer again.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.788 align:middle line:84%
But just as I was about
to leave disappointed,

00:19:53.788 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:90%
I learned something else.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> If I make a love for Liz
or someone that has a gluten

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:84%
intolerance, I'll choose
some of these softer wheats,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'll make sure that it
is really fermented, like,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:90%
for 24 hours or whatever.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> For most of his breads, Chad
uses a blend that's more white

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:90%
than whole wheat.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of ingredients,
this is nothing special,

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.643 align:middle line:84%
but it's this fermentation
that's so important.

00:20:23.643 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
This was the final
big change that

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
occurred in bread in the
last couple of generations.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.891 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:90%

after saints and things.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Up until World War II,
almost all bread was made

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
the old-fashioned way, which
is through fermentation.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It's through a
sourdough starter.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And sourdough starters,
despite all their mystique,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:90%
are very simple.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just you let flour
and water sit for days.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
You've got to tend it a
little bit, refresh it,

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.355 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes this
fermented kind of stinky goo.

00:21:06.355 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what Chad and
French bakers are doing.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
They use sourdough
starters which

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
collect bacteria and yeast
from the air around them.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And when mixed with dough,
they help bread rise.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:90%
So how did this change?

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> About 100 years ago,
the great Louis Pasteur--

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:90%
the father of pasteurized milk--

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:84%
realized there was one yeast
that was particularly powerful

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.895 align:middle line:90%
called Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:37.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Nowadays, it's
called instant yeast--

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
you know, those little
packets of dried yeast

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.025 align:middle line:90%
you get at the grocery store.

00:21:41.025 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This turns out
dough very fast.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It makes breadmaking
fairly idiot-proof.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So for big commercial bakeries
that needed a lot of bread

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and needed a recipe that
could be done by anyone

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.258 align:middle line:90%
they hired, this was a godsend.

00:22:00.258 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so we traded
regular yeast that grows

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:84%
in our kitchens for
the easy instant kind.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.395 align:middle line:90%
What's the big deal?

00:22:07.395 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people with
gluten intolerance that can eat

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:84%
a long-fermented bread
without any problem.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> This is because the
longer you ferment bread,

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
the more time the yeast has
to break down the gluten,

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:90%
sort of pre-digesting it for us.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
My first apprenticeship
in baking,

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:84%
we were letting the breads
rise for seven or eight hours.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm doing like,
you know, over 24 hours.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The longer you
ferment something,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:84%
the more flavor you're
creating, and you're also

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:46.205 align:middle line:84%
making it all more digestible,
so it's all connected.

00:22:46.205 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Chad had me convinced.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I tried his bread, and sure
enough, I didn't get sick,

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:90%
and it tasted amazing.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.903 align:middle line:84%

bread except for one thing.

>> How much did you spend
for that loaf of bread?

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It cost almost

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.463 align:middle line:84%

Is gluten intolerance just a

relationship is is problematic.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.206 align:middle line:84%
Is that the wheat's
fault or is it ours?

00:25:17.206 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know whose fault it
is, if it's the wheat itself,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the way it's milled, the change
in fermentation, or all of it.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just nice to have options,
even though they're expensive.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But I can't help but think
that what the industry has made

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:84%
cheap and accessible isn't
always the best for us,

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
trouble with bread.
