divine is everywhere,

and that there are
different levels of being

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:90%
conscious of being divine.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So the divine is also in
the smallest grain of sand.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep
looking and expanding,

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
we can meet and find
forces that extend

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:90%
across time, across dimensions.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And those are the forces
that we call gods.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
To create a future
of harmony, we also

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:90%
really looked at our past.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that for
thousands of years,

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
people had been fighting
in name of God or gods.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we realized that
it was important to come

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to a new understanding
of, what is

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between the
human beings and the gods?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And we understand
that like there

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is an ecosystem of the Earth
where everything is alive,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
there is also a
spiritual ecosystem.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything has the same divine
origin and divine quality,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:84%
but not everybody is
aware of being a god.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.292 align:middle line:84%
So we humans have to
awaken to this reality.

00:16:15.292 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
missions of Damanhur

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
is also that, to help
people and to activate

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that divine presence
in themselves.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:10%
>> When you grow up in a system,
you sort of have to accept

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:10%
the rules.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was also how I
was brought up in Denmark.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I always tried to fit in to the
structure of society in Denmark

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
and to the schools.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And it led to a
general frustration,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and it led to a sort of
seeking that then brought me

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:90%
to Damanhur.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Living in the Sacred
Forest Temple of Damanhur

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
has been the huge
transformational process.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:90%
I lived there for eight years.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Seven, eight years.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And being integrated in the
way that Damanhur treats nature

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and its contact with
nature, coming from a city,

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.545 align:middle line:84%
coming from Copenhagen,
a big contrast that

00:17:07.545 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:84%
has left a visible mark
on my heart, for sure.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's the complicity
of the life force here

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:10%
in the [ITALIAN] who helped me
to become the better version

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:10%
of myself.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It is like living
in a spiritual gym.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:84%

it moves things in you

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:84%

just by being in the woods.

rituals that we are doing,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:10%

practiced for many thousands

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:10%
of years on the Earth like the
Equinox and the Solstice that

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:10%
are all a celebration
of the pulse of nature.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Trees are so important,
because we consider them really

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:90%
as a part of our soul.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%

This is why we have it in

because that is how you can have
an interaction with the plant.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I also think
is the most exciting thing

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:84%
with this device, is that
you can actually have

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with a plant.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So this type of
interaction is for me

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:84%
really a new field

type of interaction

would be so interesting also,
not only to have a contact

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and actually understand
the plant life,

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:84%
but I think that it's also
an interesting study of how

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:84%
we also as human
beings can develop

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:84%
our methods of communication
amongst each other.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%

that different species,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:84%

are interconnected underground

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:90%

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.632 align:middle line:84%
they have this
group consciousness,

00:20:41.632 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and I really think
that that is something

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that is needed in the
world today also when it

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:90%
comes to human communication.

is what we call selfica.

about selfica,

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's a way to

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%

discover all around the world.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that we can expand

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
only say that the
universe or the Big Bang

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:90%
is an inhale and exhale.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:90%
So expansion and contraction.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:84%
We are very focused
on the first part

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that creates chaos,
entropy, time.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:84%
But we are not aware about
the second aspect that

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:90%
is to put in order everything.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:90%
That part is the evolution.

And that's why we use a spiral

the circle is open.

We are putting together
a very ancient tradition

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:90%
with modern theories.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And synchronicity
can be explained

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:90%
using only a simple spiral.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%

They are 200 tons

And this is so that the temples
can be a living antenna,

of life, to create a community,
we started to do a lot

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:84%
of research, putting together
modern physics with alchemy

there is the energy of life.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And the synchronic lines
are a sort of highway

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
to have the entire human being
to reconquer these potentials.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there was dreaming
to find the best place

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:26.800 align:middle line:84%
to start a new project,
a place full of energy,

they started from Turin

a lot of beautiful places.

not very nice was
happening here,

choice in that moment.

I'm going to take them
in there by myself.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And he went into the temples
and he revealed this thing

I had not understood at

to shut it down,

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.933 align:middle line:84%
they were so in awe of
what this thing was,

00:35:16.933 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:84%

going to find guns.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And instead, they found this

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:10%
Falco wanted to build up another

of living where we could
express the magic in daily life.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.520 align:middle line:10%
In Damanhur, we do a lot
of studies and research

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.800 align:middle line:10%
about what we can call magic
possibilities that every human

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.680 align:middle line:10%
has, but we in a way forgot.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of humanity cannot reach
all this knowledge and cannot

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:90%
express this power.

human being has.

And so over the
years in Damanhur,

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.370 align:middle line:10%
we have developed seminars,
schools, and experiences

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:10%

to awaken those powers,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:10%
those faculties, because
they are important.

It is important
that each one of us

becomes the best
version of ourselves.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.730 align:middle line:90%
We have a school for healing.

We have a school for alchemy.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.610 align:middle line:84%
We have seminars that
teach people how to dream,

experiments not only in
theory, but also in practice.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.740 align:middle line:10%
And here, Damanhur has
a unique contribution,

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:10%
because here people put into
practice what they think.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:10%
They dream, but they
don't only dream.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.740 align:middle line:10%
They also wake up and they act.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> This path of awakening
is not an easy one.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that there are
moments in which we feel closer

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and closer to the light
and others in which things

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:44.740 align:middle line:90%
seem to go much worse.

We hope and we keep our
hope, but we are in a battle.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:84%
We are in a battle
for awakening.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:84%
There are forces that are
not in favor of humans

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:03.030 align:middle line:84%
becoming fully aware
of their divine nature.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They are not in favor of
us becoming gods again.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:11.217 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to really put
all of our efforts into this,

00:38:11.217 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:90%
and we have to do this together.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.300 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Why I am here, I am
not totally sure yet.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.920 align:middle line:90%
But how I got here, I know.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I was in Iceland, and my
friend called me and said,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:84%
there's an interesting
man coming from Italy.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.180 align:middle line:84%
He lives in a community,
and you should come.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.410 align:middle line:90%
And I came.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And we did a dynamic,
like, astral travel.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And that showed a very
important vision for me

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that would guide me a lot
in my period that will come.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to see
everything in Italy.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was drinking a glass of
water that was made in Italy.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I was using a tool
that was made in Italy.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I turned on the TV, it
was something about Italy.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:84%
On the radio,
everywhere was Italy.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And then my brother,
without knowing

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that I was thinking
about Italy, gave me

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:90%
a flight ticket to Italy.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So I followed all of the
signs and I packed my bag,

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and I went to
Italy, to Damanhur.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And everything went
very well, and it

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:28.350 align:middle line:90%
was a place for me to stay.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.890 align:middle line:84%
After this, I feel like
I have to be in Italy.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Damanhur was calling me, and
I had to follow that call.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So science is explaining
to us that time is really

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:90%
a dimension.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a line
that we normally

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.930 align:middle line:84%
think that we go from
the past to the future.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But from a certain point
of view, all the variables,

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:84%
the possibilities
are all present.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.250 align:middle line:90%
So think of this.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Think maybe events for a
certain time in the future

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.610 align:middle line:90%
have already happened.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And maybe these
events did not bring

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:90%
to a good result for humanity.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Maybe humanity was destroyed.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe you can
think, well, what

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:84%
if we could create
a different line so

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:90%
that we create new events?

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:84%
You find this in all
the old prophecies.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The calendar is ending,
but what they were saying

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.570 align:middle line:90%
was a timeline is ending.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Something new is coming.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
missions of Damanhur

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is to nurture and
support the creation

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:30.300 align:middle line:84%
on a new timeline, a
line of time on which we

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.300 align:middle line:90%
can get to a future of harmony.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.680 align:middle line:84%
As we can all see by
reading the papers

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens in the
world, we are not safe yet.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We are not stable
on the new timeline.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.310 align:middle line:90%
There is constant fluctuation.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So it is very important that
everyone come to the temples,

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:84%
because these are
spiritual activators

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:84%
to make everyone
stronger, more powerful

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.910 align:middle line:90%

>> We believe to be inside time.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So for us, time is
like a container

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and we are swimming into
this water, the time.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
perspective too.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Time is the effect
of perception.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So perceiving, looking, using
our senses, we create time.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's completely a
different paradigm.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:10%
It means that the reality
we are experiencing

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:10%
is the effect of
what we believe.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a reality
that is already created,

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.460 align:middle line:84%
we are constantly creating
the reality we want.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So we can choose to
create reality we like.

Adding art, adding beauty,
adding a new kind of relation

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:10%
between people, creating a new
culture that is what we want

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:18.760 align:middle line:10%
and what we like is a way
to shape another time.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
meaning of Damanhur,

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.960 align:middle line:84%
of the community, to
co-create something together,

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.960 align:middle line:84%

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the dream of one person,

There is something that
