00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.268 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>From the beginning,
humanity has

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
yearned to understand
itself and its relationship

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:90%
with its creator.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
In the days of
Moses, the creator

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:84%
was known as the God
of our forefathers

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:90%
or the God of Abraham.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.885 align:middle line:84%
But there was no real name for
the divine creative presence.

00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Then one day, Moses, who
was just a poor shepherd,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.636 align:middle line:84%
came upon a burning
bush, and yet the fire

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:90%
did not consume the bush.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
A voice spoke to
him, saying that he

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
must go unto the pharaoh
Rameses and demand

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:90%
the release of Israelite slaves.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
When Moses asked who
he should say sent him,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:90%
God said, "I am that I am."

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
history, God had a name.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Armed with the power of
God's name, "I am that I am,"

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Moses produced some of the
greatest miracles of the Bible.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Religious authorities,
recognizing the name's

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
awesome power, declared
that uttering it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:90%
was the highest blasphemy.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.271 align:middle line:84%
And so its strength was
unrealized, misinterpreted,

00:01:58.271 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:90%
and misunderstood.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:09.019 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Moses never reached
the promised land,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
nor did the code
that could unlock

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.925 align:middle line:84%
the awesome power of God's name
and set all of humanity free.

00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>A code that could
set humanity free.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It may seem impossible,
but Moses learned something

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
from God that day that
changed the world.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we still talk about
the miracles he produced.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:84%
When God gave Moses the
name "I am that I am,"

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
there was a simple
code that went

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:84%
with it that unlocked the true
power and meaning of the words.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But then the name of God
was banned, and uttering it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
was sometimes even
punishable with death.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And so the code was lost.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
A code is a system of
letters, numbers, or symbols

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
that communicates
information when

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:90%
converted into normal language.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
If the Moses Code could unlock
the power of God's name today,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that we
would have the power

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
to create miracles just like
Moses did 3,500 years ago?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
world-renowned scholars,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
psychologists, and philosophers
will reveal the Moses Code

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and how you can harness its
energy to change your life.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have the power to
destroy the world many times

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
over, but the Moses Code
unleashes a new kind

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
of power, one that creates
worlds and helps us fulfill

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.250 align:middle line:84%
our individual and
collective destiny.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, the Moses
Code is far simpler

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:90%
than you may have imagined.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Most of us were taught that
the name given to Moses

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
was "I am that I am."

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make
sense without the code.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:84%
In reality, the name
was much simpler.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:84%
The Moses Code is
a common symbol,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
something that we see
and experience every day.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:90%
The Moses Code is a comma.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>The Moses Code is a comma?

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:90%
>>A comma.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't think so.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>"I am that, I
am" with a comma.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>We're not saying that
the Moses Code is a comma.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
We're saying the Moses
Code needs a comma.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>"I am that--

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.245 align:middle line:90%
>>Comma.

00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>--I am."

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>The right name of
God, "I am that I am,"

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.050 align:middle line:84%
has intrigued me for
many, many years.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child, I was told
this by the adults around me.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
"I am that I am,"
sayeth the Lord.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what in
the world does that mean?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.965 align:middle line:90%
"I am that I am"

00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Then one day, a spiritual
teacher said to me,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I want you to change
your life in 24 hours.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.176 align:middle line:84%
I want you to walk down the
street for 60 minutes today,

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and I want you look to
at everything you see,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to
identify personally

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
with that, whatever it is,
the grass, the flowers,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:84%
other people, the wino,
the rich person driving by,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
the chauffeur-driven
Cadillac, whatever it is.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Just look at it
and say, I am that.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.379 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:90%
I walked down the street.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.253 align:middle line:90%
I was with a friend.

00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying in
my mind, I am that.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Whatever I looked at.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.197 align:middle line:84%
If I saw violence on a
TV screen, I am that.

00:05:20.197 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
If I saw something
beautiful happening

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.436 align:middle line:84%
in the park between a mother
and a daughter, I am that.

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I was just saying that
to myself and allowing

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
myself to identify
with all that is.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And the friend that I
was with looked at me

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:90%
and said, what are you doing?

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.776 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I'm just
saying, I am that.

00:05:32.776 --> 00:05:34.275 align:middle line:84%
She said to me, no,
you're not that.

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:90%
You're not that.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:90%
You're you.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.505 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, no.

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:37.006 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:05:37.006 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I really am that.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.358 align:middle line:90%
She said, no, no.

00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:39.877 align:middle line:90%
You're you.

00:05:39.877 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:84%
You're really mixed
up in your head.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I said, listen to me.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And then I said, oh my god.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear what I just said?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:90%
I just said, I am that.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
The great name of
God, "I am that I am,"

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.702 align:middle line:84%
has been misunderstood
from the beginning of time.

00:06:01.702 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
It's simply God's simple
way, God's very human way

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:90%
of saying an enormous truth.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.509 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>It's just the presence
of God saying I am that.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere you see, you see me.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
People used to same
God is in everything.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Really, everything is in God.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>God isn't just saying
that I created that.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>God is this feel,
this presence,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that is everywhere
in its fullness.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>God is saying, I am that.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>I am that.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>I am that person.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>I am that.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.168 align:middle line:90%
>>I am that experience.

00:06:32.168 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>I am that.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>I am every that that there is.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of us are still stuck
at kind of a fifth grade

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
idea of God, and so we
have, "I am that I am"

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
is this man in the sky
with a white, flowing beard

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and these big,
long, flowing robes.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>God made us in
its image, and we've

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
been trying to return
the favor ever since,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we've made
God in a man's image.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And this "I am that I
am" is out there, ready

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to decide capriciously whether
to bless us or punish us

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%
for certain things.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Now of course,
God can't be jealous

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
because God's the
only game in town.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
God is infinite, omnipresent,
omnipotent, omniscient,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.526 align:middle line:84%
so there's nothing for
God to be jealous of.

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was a primitive mindset,
projecting human emotions

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
onto forces they
didn't understand.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>And we project that
presence outward instead

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
of having a relationship
with that presence inwardly.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>If God actually
is each one of us,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
then that would mean
that each one of us

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:90%
is an embodiment of God.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, then what
would the possibilities be?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:90%
What could we create?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.746 align:middle line:84%
>>We're walking to
the wall now, where

00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to join
thousands of other people

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
in circling the entire
Old City of Jerusalem.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>But before we go
there, we're going

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
to explore three
keys for unlocking

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
the experience of being
an embodiment of God,

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:90%
actually feeling in our bodies.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
use three letters

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to do that-- G, O, D--
to help make it easier

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:90%
for us to remember.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
When these keys are
applied to our lives,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
then we'll be able to turn
that simple comma into one

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:84%
of the most transformative
tools in history.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:84%
The first key for
experiencing ourselves

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:84%
as an embodiment
of God is Giving.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard that it's
better to give than to receive,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:90%
but is that really true?

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And how can we give if we
don't have enough ourselves?

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Mystics and saints
like Saint Francis

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
said that it is in
giving that we receive.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Is that just a nice
spiritual slogan?

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, it
really only comes down

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
to one idea that's
pretty far out.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>That which we give
to others, that which

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
we give to the world,
we give to ourselves.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So whatever one wants to
experience in one's own life,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:90%
one chooses to give away.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, the thought
is how can I give it away

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.274 align:middle line:90%
if I don't have it?

00:08:52.274 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason
I'm trying to draw it

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
to me is because
I don't have it.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But the very giving
it to another

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is what causes you to realize
you've had it all along.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a part of your brain
in the [? limbic ?] brain that

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:84%
is not time oriented and
that's not the object oriented,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:84%
meaning it can't tell the
difference between itself

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And it has no sense of
past, present, future.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
That timeless and
objectless place in my brain

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
receives what I'm giving because
it doesn't know whether it's

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
going out or whether
it's coming in.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Whatever it is that we are
creating for someone else,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
our bodies experience it first.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we offer the prayers
or the thoughts, feelings,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and emotions of a peace
for our loved ones,

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
halfway around the world
or between nations,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing that peace
and that healing as well.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, once
again, we see the example

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:90%
that giving truly is receiving.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.151 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you criticize
other people,

00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
your brain doesn't know
you're criticizing them.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It receives it as if
it was self-directed.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.745 align:middle line:84%
If you care for and
give to another person,

00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that part of the brain doesn't
know which way it's going,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:90%
so it always receives.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
The brain always receives
as a gift to itself

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.824 align:middle line:84%
what it's given
to another person.

00:10:04.824 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>We don't even have
physical contact anymore.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.823 align:middle line:84%
We don't look at each other
because of technology.

00:10:08.823 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We barely see each
other face to face.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're missing
that connection also.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Make that connection.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Give back to someone.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Let that person cut in line.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Let that person in traffic.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, it
just keeps-- it'll flow.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.914 align:middle line:90%
And you'll feel better for it.

00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a dimension
about who we

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
are that, as a result
of giving, that's

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.767 align:middle line:84%
the only way we make
that connection.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why my favorite book
says, the greatest among you

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:90%
will be your servant.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:90%
A servant is a giver.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>I think service is
misunderstood in our culture

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
because we confuse service with
servitude or servant, which

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:90%
to the ego is offensive.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:90%
It's demeaning.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.226 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
saying-- and I always

00:10:47.226 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
have used it-- to
serve is to rule.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
To be able to be of
genuine service really

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
allows you to feel that
your energy and your efforts

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:90%
make a difference.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>September, 2001,
I was in New York.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:90%
I awoke to the news.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.836 align:middle line:84%
And my friend that
I was staying with,

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Doug, we went to the roof
of his apartment building

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and watched the World
Trade Center crumble.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And both of us simultaneously
looked at each other and said,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to go down
there right now.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We were literally running
against the current of people

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that were rushing
out of the scene.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:90%
We were running into the scene.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Doug works in the media,
so he had media badges

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that allowed us to get beyond
barricades that were just

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:90%
being set up by local police.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
There was still no support
system for these firefighters

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and these rescue workers, so
it became a real necessity

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that we find food and
water really fast.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So we actually, with the support
of a couple of NYPD police

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
officers, we started
looting all the nearby delis

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:90%
and supermarkets.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And we had turkey meats,
and we had the finest

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:84%
of New York delis
meats and everything.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
After a while, it became clear
that there was just one food

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.478 align:middle line:84%
that all the rescue
workers wanted.

00:11:59.478 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And I later realized that it
was because it was comfort food.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
area where they actually

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:90%
did the first roll call.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
The fire chief stood up on
top of one of the crushed fire

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:90%
trucks.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
There were probably 400
names that he called off.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And at least half of
them were not present.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
As the reality set in with
all of the firefighters

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:84%
around, that they were not
present because they were not

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
alive, they were
in the building,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.527 align:middle line:84%
they started to literally
crumble like dominoes

00:12:31.527 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:90%
all around us.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.151 align:middle line:90%
They feel to their knees.

00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:90%
They sat on curbs.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And these big, hardened
men were just in tears.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The earth movers came
in to clear the way

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:90%
for all of the rescue vehicles.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And Wall Street was lined
with fine automobiles.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So the only way to move them
was to literally push them over

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:90%
with these earth movers.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
They just flipped the cars,
one at a time, all the way

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
down the road, flipping
cars out of the way.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And I watched these
material items

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
go from being this beautiful
car that I was drilling over to

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.354 align:middle line:90%
just been trashed in seconds.

00:13:05.354 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:90%
We watched them.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We just stood there, like
12 guys going, oh my god.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.219 align:middle line:90%
How can they do that?

00:13:10.219 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But then it became
really clear to me

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that it's like, that was
so irrelevant to the task

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
of finding people alive, that
all of the material world

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:90%
was just garbage at that point.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I had suited up in a
rescue worker's uniform,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:84%
basically, with a respirator
and everything on.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And this actually ended
up becoming my pass

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
to get into ground zero,
where it was nothing

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:90%
but qualified rescue workers.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, just
a civilian with really

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:90%
no qualification to be there.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So the first victim
that was found

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
was this little man in a suit.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been completely
crushed and disfigured

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:90%
under a fire truck.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I stood there looking
at him and imagining

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
what his story must've
been, that he likely

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
hid under the thing that
felt the most secure,

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.809 align:middle line:90%
like a fire truck.

00:13:58.809 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you what I mean?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
He probably crawled that
fire truck as debris

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
was falling only be crushed
under that fire truck

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
when that entire rig
was crushed upon him.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that was really the
first sobering moment of, wow.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.090 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
here for, and this

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
is what we're going to witness.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:90%
And am I up for it?

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really even
have think about it.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It was just a yes.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.294 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.294 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>We have to understand
that when we perform service

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
for others, we're not
really doing that.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it looks like in the
illusion that we're doing that,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.734 align:middle line:90%
that we are serving others.

00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, there's no
one else to serve but the self.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing going on in
the world except self-service.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>The more you give,
the more you receive.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:50.905 align:middle line:84%
But the desire to give is not
strictly for getting in return.

00:14:50.905 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's not this
intellectual thought of,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I'm going to
give to you, you, and you

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
because if I do, then
maybe I'll get something.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Most of us operate
in that mode already.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Moses didn't do that.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:84%
He just gave and
received and served.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>We want to get as God
gives, without expectations,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:84%
without wanting anything
in return, just to connect

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.079 align:middle line:84%
with another person, to
serve in the grandest way.

00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Greatness is your capacity
and your willingness

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:90%
to be of service.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Service to what?

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Service to love, service to
peace, service to beauty,

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:90%
service to God, service to joy.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that when
we do that, when

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
we take our attention
off all of our problems

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and all of our circumstances,
and we put it on somebody else,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:84%
it's the thought of
doing that that allows

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
us to lose track of ourselves
and lose track of our problems.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's an act of creation.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Recently, I was inspired
by my own son, Beau,

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:90%
who was having a bar mitzvah.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And the rabbi explained to him
that the mitzvah was really

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:84%
in the stretch, going beyond
what he felt comfortable doing.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>What kind of challenges do
you feel like you've faced

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and that you had to overcome
to do this great mitzvah?

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.204 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm giving away all my
money, so that's always hard.

00:16:10.204 --> 00:16:11.995 align:middle line:84%
>>What kind of project
are you going to do?

00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm raising money
to build a school

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:90%
in a poor part of Uganda.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>He decided that he
would build a school--

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>An entire school?

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, a seven
room schoolhouse.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>--and donate
100% of his money.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Moses did exactly the same
thing you're doing, Beau.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
He left his comfort zone
to do something good

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
for people that
desperately needed it.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>The village where Beau's
project is going to be built

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:90%
is called Kikoiiro.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between
a child going to school

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and not going to
school is really

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
the difference between life
and death for many children.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>It says, Beau,
I've decided to put

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
my money towards the school.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.046 align:middle line:84%
>>We've received money
from over 500 people.

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>That's great.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:90%
How old is she?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>She's only 12.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.665 align:middle line:90%
That's weird.

00:16:57.665 --> 00:16:59.653 align:middle line:90%
>>No, I think that;s beautiful.

00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:00.333 align:middle line:90%
>>I know.

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>They were just ecstatic.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And they really got that this
was a child helping children.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:84%
>>How does it feel to
be a philanthropist?

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.539 align:middle line:90%
>>What's a philanthropist?

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>This has been a
tremendous opportunity,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.435 align:middle line:84%
not just for the
children of Kikoiiro,

00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:84%
but for also kids in the US to
get the idea that there's more

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.917 align:middle line:90%
that they can do.

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>There's some people that
don't have the capacity

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.291 align:middle line:84%
to receive the good that
wants to come into their life.

00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And they end up
becoming martyrs.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
They end up burning themself
out because they give,

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:84%
but they never
replenish themself

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
through being available
to the presence expressing

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
through them,
through receptivity.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>The couples who proceed
slowly in therapy,

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
the couples who seem
to never get there,

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and no matter what happens
in the relationship,

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
they just don't, quote,
"really improve,"

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:84%
have what we call a
defense against receiving.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
They have no receptors for
letting stuff in, not only

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
letting love in, but letting
compliments in, letting

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
positive statements in,
letting appreciation in.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>To surrender yourself enough
to be able to receive, first

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
from God, the Holy Spirit, and
then from those around you,

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I think is one of the most
sacred acts that we perform.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>The complete, whole
state is an individual

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that gives with ease
and with the grace.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They are here to give, to
share their gifts, their time,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
their talents, their capacities,
while at the same time,

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.972 align:middle line:84%
they're in tune with the
fundamental order of existence,

00:18:36.972 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:90%
their real being.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're receptive to
this flow through them.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
They can receive love.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
They can receive intuitive hits.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:84%
They can receive
wisdom and guidance.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
They can receive the
beauty that is everywhere.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:90%
So there's a complete cycle.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, giving
and receiving are one.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.765 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.765 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Most of us have heard
prophets and sages

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.073 align:middle line:84%
and enlightened beings
say that we're all one.

00:19:03.073 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But we look out at the world and
we see separation everywhere.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:90%
So how can that be true?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that I'm one
with Jack the Ripper as well

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:90%
as Mother Teresa?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that
I'm one with you?

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Are these just airy fairy ideas?

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Or could this be
the next step in all

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
of us realizing that we're
actually an embodiment of God?

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>The fundamental principle
that you find encoded

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
in all major religions, all
authentic spiritual paths,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.665 align:middle line:84%
is this spiritual
idea called oneness,

00:19:36.665 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:90%
that we are at one with life.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.025 align:middle line:84%
We're at one with
the presence of God.

00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:90%
We're at one with each other.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>We find that in
all the traditions.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
"Hear, o Israel, the
Lord our God is one."

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:90%
One presence, one power.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The Atman, the Buddha
nature, the Christed one.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's in quantum physics, Rupert
Sheldrake, the unified field.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:90%
One presence, everywhere.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>This oftentimes
doesn't seem to square

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:84%
with physical
evidence, primarily

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
because the average
individual sees the world

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:84%
through the filter of
a sense of separation.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
They see the world
through their senses.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>And if you're more
in the ego, then you're

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
going to sense survival
fear, this angst

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.376 align:middle line:84%
that you've got to get yours,
that it's all about getting,

00:20:21.376 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:90%
getting, getting, getting.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Through spiritual
practices, you go beyond that

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
the sensory realm, and
you enter into a field

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:84%
where you see not with
eyesight, but with insight

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:90%
that everything is connected.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
The scientists, the
quantum scientists,

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.724 align:middle line:84%
would call it a unified
field that is everywhere

00:20:39.724 --> 00:20:41.265 align:middle line:84%
in its fullness,
that it's undivided.

00:20:41.265 --> 00:20:43.015 align:middle line:84%
>>Because that's what's
being awake means.

00:20:43.015 --> 00:20:45.791 align:middle line:84%
It's say, well, I'm dancing
this illusion of separateness

00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.479 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not separate.

00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>So once an individual
has broken through,

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
then all the things on the
surface that seem separate

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
begin to work
together for our good

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
because we're now in
tune with everything

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:90%
on the invisible level.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So you end up
working not harder,

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:84%
but you end up working a
lot cleaner, a lot easier,

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
because you're in
tune with all of life.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So you're not trying to
make something happen

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
on the surface, you're trying
to make something welcome

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:90%
on the invisible side of life.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So oneness is the
primary principle.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:90%
It's the linchpin of power.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:84%
We're at one with God, one
with live, one with life,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
one with all the
power that there is.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Until we're willing to embrace
the totality of our humanity

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and our divinity, we
can never be in oneness

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
because we're taught
to say, I'm not that.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to say, I see
something I don't like,

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:90%
so I don't want to be that.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And we push that part
of ourselves aside.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>All of us, including
myself, at times

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
find it hard to be at one
with someone or someones

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that either don't
agree with us or that

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
have values that we believe
to be totally destructive.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>These days, I'm having a lot
of trouble with phony people.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that I don't
like that part of myself,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that I'm always
searching for ways to be

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
more authentic and more real
and show more of myself,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:90%
even as a teacher.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>I finally went to
take my first nap

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.177 align:middle line:90%
in 40 hours, 40 plus hours.

00:22:27.177 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of timeless there.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I found an
apartment building

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that had been
completely abandoned.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into the lobby
of this apartment building,

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:90%
and I found a couch.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And I dusted it off, and I lay
down on the couch with my face

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:90%
against the back of the couch.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I cuddled up,
and I bundled up.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And probably about a half
hour into my sleepless nap,

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the little man,
the first victim that we found,

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
the little man in
a suit, I could

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:90%
feel him kneeling behind me.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.580 align:middle line:90%
And I could see it vividly.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
He was kneeling behind
me, his disfigured

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
face staring at the
back of my head.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I could fill his breath
on the back of my neck.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:90%
And I was pretty terrified.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.077 align:middle line:84%
And I just lay there
for I don't know

00:23:17.077 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:84%
how long it was, five or 10
minutes, just thinking, what

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:90%
is he doing?

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was still and quiet
long enough for that voice,

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
it, my internal voice, that

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:84%
said to me, very loud
and clearly, this

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
could be your Vietnam
or dot, dot, dot.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.622 align:middle line:84%
>>And it just left me
kind of hanging like that.

00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
dot, dot, dot, was.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But I knew what the, this
could be your Vietnam,

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
meant, having grown up seeing
all the ex-vets with all

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
of their drama that
they have brought back

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
from the war and
their flashbacks.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Having just had my first
ground zero flashback,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this
could be something

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that could stay with me that
way for the rest of my life

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and it could probably
trouble my future.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Or-- and I knew that
the answer to the

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:90%
or was back out on the rubble.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.605 align:middle line:84%
So I got up, and I suited it
up again, and I put my mask on.

00:24:16.605 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I walked around
the building.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.465 align:middle line:84%
And as I rounded
the corner, they

00:24:20.465 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:90%
had put up a new work light.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was this very
bright, brilliant light.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And everything just seemed
so bright and so brilliant

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.614 align:middle line:90%
that I was just struck.

00:24:31.614 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked around
at all these people.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And everything,
everything just instantly

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:90%
appeared different to me.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And I stood there
with tears in my eyes.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It felt like the world
was in slow motion.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I was watching people go
by, and all I could see was

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
is spirits crossing
and spirits working,

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:90%
chain gangs of spirits.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was so clear to me that
everything was interconnected.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was all one
big body of God.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had
dropped their egos.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:90%
They had drop their identities.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:90%
They had dropped their rank.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were working together
for the greater good of all.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was so lit
up with possibility

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:84%
for human kind, of what
it can be like when we all

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.540 align:middle line:84%
are working together
in this way.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.765 align:middle line:84%
And I could really get beyond
concept what oneness was.

00:25:23.765 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that the entire
world was experiencing

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
what it was experiencing,
all the separation and fear

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and chaos that was
going on in the world,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
here I was standing there,
experiencing in the greatest

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:90%
bliss and beauty of my life.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just wishing
that the world could

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.565 align:middle line:84%
see this situation
through my eyes.

00:25:47.565 --> 00:25:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>When I first decided to be
on this spiritual journey,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I was really looking
to become a better me.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And my sister always
told me that I was angry

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was selfish
and self-absorbed

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and this whole list of
characteristics that I

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.620 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to be.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So I started working on
becoming this nice person.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I learned how to
talk in a nice voice.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And I learned how
to give things away

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:90%
that I had if you wanted them.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I did all these things.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
a seminar one day.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing there, and
everybody's looking at me.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
seminar, this woman shouts out,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:90%
you're a [BLEEP].

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, I know that.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:90%
How does she know?

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.353 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me, let me
ask you something, Debbie.

00:26:34.353 --> 00:26:37.010 align:middle line:84%
If you were remodeling
a house and you

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.850 align:middle line:84%
were six weeks late and
$20,000 over budget,

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:84%
do you think it might help
to be a little [BLEEP]?

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
a light went on

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because I thought if I just got
rid of all my bad qualities--

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and believe me, I have
plenty-- that somehow that

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:90%
would make me a good person.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
The piece I was missing is
that every dark quality of mine

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.909 align:middle line:90%
came bearing gifts.

00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>And you can go down the list.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Things that we see
that are very negative

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes have the
effect of taking us

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
to the next stage
of our evolution.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:84%
You take somebody
like a George Bush.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.471 align:middle line:90%
He was an evolutionary trigger.

00:27:12.471 --> 00:27:14.062 align:middle line:84%
He's galvanized
the peace movement,

00:27:14.062 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:84%
parts of the peace movement
that haven't spoken

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:84%
to each other in many
years, since the '60s.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.380 align:middle line:84%
He comes along with a war ethic
and a preemptive strike war

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
ethic, peace movement
starts talking.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So he actually was a
very positive force

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:84%
for the evolution of many
positive things on the planet.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>See, if I want to grow
and evolve spiritually,

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I have to take my
projection off of them

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and own and embrace
that part of myself.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>We have to be
lovers of humanity.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:84%
We have to be lovers
of ourself, and even

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.559 align:middle line:84%
seek to love that which our
ego or our mental perception

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:90%
would say, you know what?

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't love that.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm a phony [BLEEP].

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.625 align:middle line:84%
Now the question
is, how am I going

00:27:56.625 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
to love myself being
a phony [BLEEP].

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Go within and
embrace it anyway.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>And even as I
say this, they're

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
probably going to bleep
me out because nobody

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:84%
can bear that they might
be a phony [BLEEP].

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So they've got to shut
me down, and we all

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:84%
have to pretend
like we're not that.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:84%
People get confused in this
conversation because they'll

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:90%
say, well, I'm not a murderer.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Or, I'm not a rapist.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But I would say, find
out what kind of person

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:90%
would be a murderer.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
What kind of person
would be a rapist?

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Those are the questions
that we must ask ourselves

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
because maybe a rapist would be
somebody who's wounded or sick.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:84%
We all have a wounded
part of ourselves.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
We all have a sick
part of ourselves.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:84%
We all have a twisted
part of ourselves.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And even though we'd like to fit
into the ego's ideal of being

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:84%
a perfect human
being, we're not.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:90%
We're all that there is.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And when we can open our
hearts and have compassion

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:84%
for the part of us
that might murder,

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:84%
we have no idea if
we're capable of that,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.450 align:middle line:84%
especially if we're living
and watching this film.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
But maybe, maybe, the right
or wrong circumstances, we

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:84%
are all capable of anything,
the most beautiful, glorious,

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:19.240 align:middle line:84%
act of greatness, and
what we would consider

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
one of the most horrible
crimes against humanity.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we embrace
all of ourselves,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we're both
human and that we are divine,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.655 align:middle line:90%
well, voila.

00:29:29.655 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden you have
a whole human being.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:90%
And what you feel is oneness.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>I was married to a woman
who was in so many ways

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:84%
the embodiment of all the
things we're talking about.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Linda has always been
such an inspiration for me

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and I know for so many
other people because

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:90%
of her kindness and her beauty.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:84%
When my daughter and I were
in Minnesota with family,

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:84%
we woke up the next
morning to hear

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that two men had broken into her
apartment and had killed her.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The anger and the grief and
the profound sadness for me

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:90%
was overwhelming.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.090 align:middle line:84%
My daughter and I and
a couple of others,

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.057 align:middle line:90%
we were talking and crying.

00:30:11.057 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:90%
It was very late at night.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.181 align:middle line:84%
And my cell phone was
beeping because the battery

00:30:14.181 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:90%
was wearing down.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I just hit the button
to turn the power off.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But for the first
time, it didn't go off.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Something very
different happened.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:27.310 align:middle line:84%
The one and only picture that
I have of Linda on my phone

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:84%
flashed full screen
and froze there.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And we felt her so
profoundly connected with us.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was in that moment I felt
this profound shift within me,

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.510 align:middle line:84%
even toward these men
who had killed her.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
For me, the powerful emotion
I felt over and over again

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:84%
was this connection,
this compassion,

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
for people who must have
gone through something truly

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
terrible to have committed
such a terrible crime

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.780 align:middle line:84%
against a woman who was
so beloved and so cared

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:90%
for by everyone that knew her.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:84%
There was a song that I wrote
and performed at her funeral.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way of
both healing my heart,

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.840 align:middle line:84%
but also imagining
what Linda would

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
say from the other
side of the veil,

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
if she could reach back and
speak to us about oneness.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:34.865 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) And if ever you forget
me, just call me by my name.

00:31:34.865 --> 00:31:48.238 align:middle line:84%
And my soul, it will
answer time and time again.

00:31:48.238 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And if ever you should leave
me, I'm never really gone.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:09.158 align:middle line:84%
You can find me deep
within you, in the one.

00:32:09.158 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>If you have a
spiritual practice when

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
those insights
occur, they integrate

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.950 align:middle line:90%
into your way of living.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:29.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't wipe you
out, nor do they just

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.310 align:middle line:84%
fade into the recesses of
memory as to a wonderful moment

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:90%
you once had.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Integrates into you.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And that sense of
oneness and unity

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:90%
becomes more real than anything.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Do you have a destiny?

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Moses believed that his destiny
was to lead the Israelites out

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt into the promised
land, while on the other hand,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Forrest Gump felt that life
is like a box of chocolates,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and you never know what
you're going to get.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:84%
It can be a little scary trying
to tackle an idea so big.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But it might be
worth another look,

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.540 align:middle line:84%
since the final key to
experiencing yourself

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.820 align:middle line:84%
as an embodiment of God
is to uncover your deepest

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
yearning and your
reason for living.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>The calling is always upon us.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.085 align:middle line:84%
There's always
something within us

00:33:26.085 --> 00:33:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that wants to become
conscious of itself as us.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It's called the next
stage of our evolution.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:84%
There's something within all
of us that we must express.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So Moses represents you
and me, an ordinary person

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
on an ordinary day having an
extraordinary experience, where

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.363 align:middle line:84%
Moses climbs a
mountain and there he

00:33:44.363 --> 00:33:47.760 align:middle line:84%
has an encounter with a
presence that shows up

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.690 align:middle line:84%
as this flame in a
bush that is burning.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But the bush won't
be consumed, meaning

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.810 align:middle line:84%
that the source of this presence
isn't in the material realm.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The source of this
presence comes from

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.277 align:middle line:84%
and is presencing that
which is divine and eternal.

00:34:02.277 --> 00:34:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And Moses doesn't know
quite what to do with this,

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.074 align:middle line:90%
as either you or I would do.

00:34:06.074 --> 00:34:07.740 align:middle line:84%
He knows-- there's
something in him that

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:84%
knows this is about
completely transform his life.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, I consider myself
a fairly spiritual person.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.199 align:middle line:84%
But if I were sitting
here today and the bush

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:84%
were to start
burning, in my mind,

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:23.142 align:middle line:84%
I'd go get the
fire extinguisher.

00:34:23.142 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>The bush is always glowing.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I had an opportunity to be with
a powerful shaman in Africa

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.884 align:middle line:84%
And we were traveling at night,
and I was kind of stumbling,

00:34:34.884 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and they would just
walk into the jungle

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:90%
like it was daylight.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.908 align:middle line:84%
And we went out to
a clearing and had

00:34:39.908 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
this very powerful
experience out there.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.699 align:middle line:84%
And after the experience,
everything was lit up.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything was aglow
with this fire.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:90%
The leaves were on fire.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:90%
The ground was on fire.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything was aglow.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:57.142 align:middle line:84%
And I was aware that these
individuals that were taking me

00:34:57.142 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
through the jungle, they
were seeing like this.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.760 align:middle line:84%
They had this night
vision that allowed

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
them to see the luminosity
from all of nature.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And in that instant,
I had the same thing.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I had that kind of
a spiritual night

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.344 align:middle line:84%
vision that allowed me
to see that everything

00:35:09.344 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:84%
was ablaze with
the spirit of God.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about Moses
seeing the burning bush.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.810 align:middle line:84%
That moment he was in
transcendent awareness,

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that he could see clearly
that God is everywhere.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And everything is aglow
with this fire, this power,

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:90%
and this presence.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Moses was having a good day.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>When Moses asks the
bush, asks this flames,

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.410 align:middle line:90%
asks this presence, who are you?

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:90%
He hears, "I am that I am."

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know whether
the conversation is actually

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.330 align:middle line:84%
audible in human terms
or it's a transmission

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.060 align:middle line:84%
from the knower
that is everywhere

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.810 align:middle line:90%
present into his heart.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, this
communication says something.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And the communication is this.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.160 align:middle line:84%
There is a journey
you are to take.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell would later
call that the hero's journey.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's a journey
that is for each one of us

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to take that takes us from our
local, temporal, egoistic point

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:84%
of view or self to an
understanding, a person

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:84%
of destiny, a person of
wholeness and completeness.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And that journey is
the Moses journey.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Moses didn't
think he was worthy.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that unworthiness
combined with willingness

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.810 align:middle line:84%
provided a space for
the presence of God

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.800 align:middle line:84%
to come through because
Moses wasn't blocking God out

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:90%
with his ego.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.895 align:middle line:84%
>>So the rest of the story
is both a literal story,

00:36:30.895 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
a historic story, but
it's also a meta-story.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of you
and the story of me.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And all the characters in that
story are parts of ourselves.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So Moses is then told that he
must go and free the slaves.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And he is to take them
to the promised land

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.500 align:middle line:84%
or to fulfillment, to the
land of milk and honey.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And he questions it.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.770 align:middle line:90%
He stutters.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:54.650 align:middle line:90%
He can't speak well.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.020 align:middle line:90%
He's like, who am I to do this?

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And you and I feel
the same way when

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:02.330 align:middle line:84%
a dream, an idea a calling,
something calls to us

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference, give
something, do something

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
in your local community,
do something for the world,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.265 align:middle line:84%
do something for your
family, do something.

00:37:09.265 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And right away, we feel
like, oh, I'm not up to it.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't have what is required.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not enough for that.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>I think everyone has to
come to grips with the fact

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that there's a destiny
within all of us.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:84%
There's something
calling all of us.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And we are presently
not the person

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:90%
that can deliver that destiny.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:84%
We grow into it as
we say yes to it.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:84%
There's an old statement
that God does not

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.790 align:middle line:90%
call the qualified.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:84%
God qualifies the called, so
that when we answer that call,

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:90%
then the presence qualifies you.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:90%
It qualified me.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have all of the skills.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have the resources.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.299 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have the money.

00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have the space.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Didn't have anything.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:84%
But God qualified
me through my yes.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:90%
So people showed up.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Resources showed up.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.447 align:middle line:90%
Buildings showed up.

00:37:56.447 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Individuals who could catch the
vision that I was articulating

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.230 align:middle line:90%
showed up.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And then I changed.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I grew.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So the person they
said yes is not

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:84%
the same person
sitting here today.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The person that's
sitting here today,

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
saying yes to the next
stage of the vision,

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:84%
will not be the person that
inherits and articulates

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and manifests that
aspect of the vision.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.600 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly evolving
and growing and unfolding,

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.330 align:middle line:84%
based on our ability
and our willingness

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and our capacity to
say, yes, I'm willing.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>And so Moses agrees
to the journey.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's that part
of us that says yes

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.380 align:middle line:84%
to our own destiny, that
says yes to our purpose

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:90%
as we discover it.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
comes having to encounter

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Pharaoh, not only
the historic pharaoh,

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.010 align:middle line:90%
but the personal pharaoh.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The personal pharaoh
is our intellect.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of
us that's all made

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.550 align:middle line:84%
an agreement with the
kingdom of our lives

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
as we've known it, everything
just as it is, the status

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.864 align:middle line:90%
quo, the comfort zone.

00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this part
of us that was to emerge,

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:84%
this part of us wants
to make a difference.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
whole argument that

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.480 align:middle line:84%
goes on internally
about, no, I'm

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.480 align:middle line:90%
not about to make that change.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, in
this story, which

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.640 align:middle line:84%
is your story and my
story, the hero's journey,

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.689 align:middle line:90%
the trouble builds up.

00:39:08.689 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:90%
The trouble gets tougher.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Things get more and
more complicated.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And finally in desperation,
pharaoh says, OK.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Take the people and go.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, the thing that I find
very interesting about Moses

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:84%
is that he had a
speech impediment.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what kind it was.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But one might think, why
would God choose someone

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:32.196 align:middle line:84%
with a speech impediment-- let's
say a stutter-- to deliver 400,

00:39:32.196 --> 00:39:37.430 align:middle line:84%
4,000, however many,
unruly Israelites

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.059 align:middle line:90%
into a new way of being?

00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So here they are,
fussing and arguing

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.038 align:middle line:84%
among themselves and Moses
with his speech impediment,

00:39:44.038 --> 00:39:46.810 align:middle line:90%
(STUTTERING).

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You would say, why does God
have such a sense of humor?

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And you'd say, why
would he choose Moses?

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the reasons
why God could use him

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%
is because of his humility.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes people that seem
that they're lacking something

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.045 align:middle line:84%
within themself, they
become great vessels

00:40:04.045 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and great vehicles
for the power of God

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to express through
because there's

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.380 align:middle line:84%
nothing to inhibit the flow
from expressing through them.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Very often we think we have
impediment or limitations,

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and we don't think
God can use us.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But God will take your
limitation and use your

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and it to deliver somebody
else into a new place

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and a new way of being.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>So the sea opens.

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the real journey
begins because they

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.445 align:middle line:90%
spend 40 years in the desert.

00:40:34.445 --> 00:40:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.510 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible and in many
of the mystical traditions,

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.190 align:middle line:84%
40 is symbolic of
simply this, the amount

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
of time required
for transformation.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Noah has 40 days in the flood.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Jesus has 40 days on
the mount of temptation.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Moses has 40 years
in the desert.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the amount of time
required for the transformation.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And for some of us, this is
our 40th moment right now.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Watching this right
now, we know that this

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:84%
is the moment when
the life we've lived

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.360 align:middle line:84%
is not sufficient to the purpose
that we're being called for.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it's useful
for us to understand

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.302 align:middle line:90%
why the soul came to the body.

00:41:17.302 --> 00:41:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The soul came into
physicality in order

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.920 align:middle line:84%
that it might experience
itself, express itself,

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world as
who it really is, thus

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to know itself in
its own experience.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>So the fear is that if we
identify the "I am that I am"

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:84%
with the "I am that I
am," that somehow it

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.310 align:middle line:84%
makes us pretending to be
something we're not being

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:90%
or taking on something.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:84%
But what if it's
just the opposite?

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:50.445 align:middle line:84%
What if by saying that I
am an opportunity for the

00:41:50.445 --> 00:41:54.120 align:middle line:84%
"I am that I am" to presence
divine love through my hands

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.350 align:middle line:84%
this day to a child
that I'm teaching

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:84%
or to an old person I'm
helping carry the groceries

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.590 align:middle line:84%
or to someone that I call who's
in pain or hurting in some way,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and I'm the voice
that comforts them?

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:84%
What if when we give ourselves
just the possibility that if we

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:84%
allow ourselves,
the "I am that I am"

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.965 align:middle line:84%
might be an avenue through
which the "I am that I am"

00:42:15.965 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that is God, that is
the presence, that

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.120 align:middle line:84%
is the power of life
itself, might find a way,

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.690 align:middle line:84%
an entry point, to make a
difference for good right

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>Ah, but we've got
to be careful here

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:30.370 align:middle line:84%
because when the ego start
to think that it's God,

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.870 align:middle line:90%
it just gets arrogant.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.030 align:middle line:90%
It gets greedy.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.960 align:middle line:90%
It takes us over completely.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pretty picture.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
We have to dip in to our
soul, to our essence,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.580 align:middle line:84%
in order to be
all that there is.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>The difficulty is this.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We're a mixture
of a constellation

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:84%
of different
identities that have

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.250 align:middle line:90%
emerged for different reasons.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:50.740 align:middle line:90%
We're mothers.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.290 align:middle line:90%
We're fathers.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.915 align:middle line:90%
We're brothers.

00:42:51.915 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:90%
We're sisters.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:middle line:90%
We're employers.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040 align:middle line:90%
We're employees.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:90%
There's all kinds of identities.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And every single
identity is pulling

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.870 align:middle line:84%
upon our energy
for its survival.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.740 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
a central identity

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.620 align:middle line:90%
which is the I am presence.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a central
identity which is not

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in comparison with
all other identities

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:84%
or in comparison
with anybody else.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the image and
likeness of God.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a unique configuration
of infinite potential,

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:90%
infinite possibility.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And within that core
identity, it is speaking.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.630 align:middle line:84%
It's calling our real name
and inviting us to greatness.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It's inviting us
to be more ourself.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Remember, it's the
still, small voice.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to get quiet
enough to hear it.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>And through spiritual practice
of prayer, lowly listening,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:84%
meditation, after
a while, you're

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.420 align:middle line:84%
able to tell the difference
between the voice of one

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.530 align:middle line:84%
of the constellation of shifting
identities or the true voice

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that's coming from your soul
that wants you to be great.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And the definition of
greatness is your capacity

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.310 align:middle line:90%
and your willingness to serve.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.875 align:middle line:84%
>>When we get past
survival, when

00:43:57.875 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:84%
we get past those
small-minded things,

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.090 align:middle line:84%
then the only thing
the soul wants to do

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:07.015 align:middle line:84%
is to make a difference,
to give to humanity.

00:44:07.015 --> 00:44:07.821 align:middle line:90%
>>What can I do?

00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:10.070 align:middle line:84%
There's so much you can do,
you can't even believe it.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Right the end of your
fingertips is a whole world

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.770 align:middle line:90%
of your possible creation.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is ignited, it is
inspired, it is embraced,

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and it is, in fact, experienced
in extraordinary ways

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the moment you decide to be in
service, not just to the world,

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.720 align:middle line:84%
but to the world of
your own creation.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.985 align:middle line:84%
>>When that central voice
begins to speak, and it's still

00:44:29.985 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's small, it's calling you
to a greater degree of service

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and a greater degree of
serving humankind, a greater

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:84%
degree of serving your family,
a greater degree of serving

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.300 align:middle line:84%
everyone you come
in contact with.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.030 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
ways you can tell

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.030 align:middle line:84%
the difference
between that voice.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it calling to serve?

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Or is it calling you just
to take care of yourself?

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.510 align:middle line:84%
If it's calling you just
to take care of yourself,

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:90%
it may be coming from the ego.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.475 align:middle line:84%
>>The question
often arises for us,

00:44:58.475 --> 00:45:01.100 align:middle line:84%
so how do I know the difference
between God's will and my will?

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And do I have a will?

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.140 align:middle line:90%
What do I do with my will?

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of that
is that, where is God?

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, the kingdom
of God is within you.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So within us, we know we
have the pharaoh part,

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.616 align:middle line:84%
or the intellect, or
the part of us that

00:45:16.616 --> 00:45:18.340 align:middle line:84%
argues for circumstances
that we know.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the prophetic part.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.480 align:middle line:84%
There's the part of
us that does have

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.390 align:middle line:84%
a destiny, that
does have a call,

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.640 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference for good.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so when we align the
pharaoh with the heart,

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:84%
then we align our
will with God's will.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>When we enact creation, we
are emulating the creator.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that
is that we feel good.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:90%
We feel love.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:45.830 align:middle line:90%
We feel expanded.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>You also need inner peace.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It needs contentment,
love, creative expression,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.650 align:middle line:90%
and of course divine connection.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are the qualities
that make you feel good.

00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>You're actually
wired so that you'll

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:04.220 align:middle line:84%
know you're on track by
the aliveness you feel.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.070 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>And it's in your being,
your embracing of the presence

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and standing in that, that
you give the greatest gift

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.580 align:middle line:90%
that you can to the world.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>And so the understanding about
that and then living from that

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.159 align:middle line:90%
is the journey.

00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:24.200 align:middle line:84%
A Course in Miracles calls
it the 18 inch journey

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.820 align:middle line:90%
from the head to the heart.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>In that moment, standing there
overlooking ground zero and all

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.440 align:middle line:84%
the chaos that was going
on, arose my life destiny.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.790 align:middle line:84%
All my selfish pursuit
of trying to get

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:40.340 align:middle line:84%
what I needed to get and be
where I needed to be in my life

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.780 align:middle line:90%
just seemed ridiculous.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:47.441 align:middle line:84%
I knew that from that point
on, my life would be about all

00:46:47.441 --> 00:46:47.940 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.510 align:middle line:90%
It would be about community.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:54.210 align:middle line:84%
My heart was so filled with
possibility, of what we're

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.310 align:middle line:84%
capable of when we're
working from that point.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it's
possible, my whole life

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.930 align:middle line:84%
now has been about
recreating that community.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It is the catalyst
for my wanting

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:09.180 align:middle line:84%
to create Elevate Film Festival,
which, when you really break it

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:84%
down, it's just a community
of people who understand

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.550 align:middle line:84%
this oneness that
I'm talking about.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Can we bring people
into an experience

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.550 align:middle line:84%
that's so much bigger
than who we think

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
we are that we can experience
that level of oneness?

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.004 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
do, there's nothing

00:47:27.004 --> 00:47:29.170 align:middle line:84%
more beautiful in this
lifetime and this experience.

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.828 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
greater than that.

00:47:30.828 --> 00:47:33.820 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>The kingdom of God
is unconditional love.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.670 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of God
is peace of mind.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of God
is joy in my soul.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, let
me seek that stuff.

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't have to
worry about getting anything,

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:56.020 align:middle line:84%
being with anybody,
doing anything special.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Let me go for the unconditional
love, first of myself,

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and then to be able to
extend it to everyone else.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Let me go for the
peace of mind where

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not worried about what
might happen, what could happen,

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.760 align:middle line:84%
where I'm just embracing
the presence, my I

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.900 align:middle line:84%
am-ness, the manna of God
in this right now moment.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.745 align:middle line:90%
Let me go for that.

00:48:16.745 --> 00:48:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And let that trickle
down and fill

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:21.800 align:middle line:90%
every other aspect of my life.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>That's the kingdom.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:84%
To that degree that we
begin to know who we are,

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that who I am behind my
eyes is the same person

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that you are behind your
eyes, then that's the kingdom.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the connection
that connects all of us.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And as we get closer
to that, then we

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.240 align:middle line:84%
begin to manifest the
attributes of that in our life,

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.840 align:middle line:90%
in our daily living.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>So once I really understood
what the kingdom was, oh yeah.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, baby.

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I want to seek that.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>So paradoxically
in that moment,

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:56.360 align:middle line:84%
while the world was experiencing
chaos and confusion and fear,

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I was standing
there experiencing

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:03.100 align:middle line:84%
my first true
experience with God.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Through giving and the
service that I was witness to,

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.775 align:middle line:84%
I experienced the oneness,
the greatest sense of oneness,

00:49:10.775 --> 00:49:13.010 align:middle line:90%
that I ever knew was possible.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:90%
And from that arose my destiny.

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Now that we understand the
three keys for experiencing

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.390 align:middle line:84%
ourselves as an
embodiment of God,

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.350 align:middle line:84%
now it's time for
us to consider what

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:84%
we can create from
that new experience.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.550 align:middle line:84%
If saying and being,
I am that I am, really

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.510 align:middle line:84%
can unlock the power
of God within us,

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:38.280 align:middle line:84%
the next question is, well,
how extensive is that power?

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Can we move mountains and create
miracles like Jesus and Moses?

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Are these just
fantastical ideas,

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.040 align:middle line:84%
or can they really
change the world?

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>"I" is the creative
factor of the universe.

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you add "am"
to it, what you get

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:56.780 align:middle line:84%
is the movement of the
creative force of the universe.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So every time you say,
"I am," you are creating.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:00.930 align:middle line:90%
You are creating movement.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:90%
We say, I am broke.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and that's how you stay.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I am lonely.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and that's how you stay.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to begin
to use the creative force

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and energy of that name, I,
and the movement of am to say,

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:16.130 align:middle line:90%
I am whole.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:17.350 align:middle line:90%
I am holy.

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I am complete.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:18.977 align:middle line:90%
I am beautiful.

00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:19.560 align:middle line:90%
I am gorgeous.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.510 align:middle line:90%
I am wealthy.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I am, we begin energy
moving in our life.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:90%
And we re-educate our souls.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.900 align:middle line:84%
That's all Moses had
to do, was to bring

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that oneness, that
creative energy of God,

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and put an action to it.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And Pharaoh had no
choice but to back down.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.270 align:middle line:84%
He recognized what
he was dealing with.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>He was able to take
the I am presence

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and lift up an entire nation
to see who and what they really

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.880 align:middle line:90%
were and whose they really were.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>There's actually a way to
activate this creative energy

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.890 align:middle line:84%
through a process that we
can practice every day.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing
about this process

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is that it applies to almost
every area of our life.

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can remember it
with five simple words.

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:01.058 align:middle line:90%
And guess what the words are?

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>(WHISPERING) I am that, I am.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>The only thing
that changes is what

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:08.890 align:middle line:84%
you focus on when
you say those words.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:10.680 align:middle line:84%
The first step is
to imagine what

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.730 align:middle line:84%
you want to be, do, or
have and really make sure

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that it's something
that matters.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And the second step is to repeat
the words, "I am that, I am"

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to expand
into that new possibility.

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>So if we want to have
a new way of being,

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:31.080 align:middle line:84%
we must say it and repeat it
time and time and time again.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:35.450 align:middle line:84%
When we repeat things, we encode
them in our consciousness.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>The third step is pretty easy.

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're
already doing it.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.750 align:middle line:90%
It's to breathe.

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Controlled breathing
centers you, energizes you,

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and actually
amplifies the effect.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.920 align:middle line:84%
One way to practice this
is to say, I am that,

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.250 align:middle line:90%
on the out breath.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And then as you breathe in,
either think or say the words,

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.870 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:00.250 align:middle line:90%
(WHISPERING) I am.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.147 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:52:02.147 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:90%
(WHISPERING) I am.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.170 align:middle line:84%
This simple process
takes whatever

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:10.690 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling and imagining and
projects it out into the world

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:14.300 align:middle line:84%
so that you can experience
it in your real life.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the ways I like to
support people in doing this

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is by thinking about the
qualities that inspire you,

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.590 align:middle line:90%
the qualities that you desire.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.510 align:middle line:84%
See somebody--
maybe you know them

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.840 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you've read about
them-- in your awareness.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Bring that image of
them very close to you.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And then just close your
eyes and start repeating,

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I am that, I am, really allowing
yourself to encode that image,

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that way of being, and those
qualities right into yourself.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>I am the joy I
want to experience.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I am the peace I
want to experience.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I am the beauty I
want to realize.

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I am the abundance
I want to realize.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And through the power
of that declaration,

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.940 align:middle line:84%
through the flow of
that kind of energy,

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.750 align:middle line:84%
it manifests in
and as your life.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>When we talk about
manifestation or getting stuff,

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.710 align:middle line:90%
we want two cars, three houses.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:10.625 align:middle line:90%
You've got one butt.

00:53:10.625 --> 00:53:14.256 align:middle line:90%
Why do you need four cars?

00:53:14.256 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I could say the same
thing about shoes.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.630 align:middle line:90%
I've got two feet.

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I've got 80 pairs of shoes.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's manna to my soul.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But manifestation
of things is not

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:28.840 align:middle line:84%
the same thing as manna,
the presence of God,

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.320 align:middle line:90%
that supplies your every need.

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>There are some people that
are dominated by the ego,

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.630 align:middle line:90%
and they try to get.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They try to use the principles
for acquisitiveness,

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:41.240 align:middle line:90%
to get things.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.730 align:middle line:90%
And they hoard.

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And inside, they're
very poor people.

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.600 align:middle line:84%
They may have a lot of
stuff, but they're just

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.000 align:middle line:90%
poor people with a lot of stuff.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Advanced students
understand that it

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:54.080 align:middle line:84%
works exactly the opposite, not
to try to magnetize something

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.110 align:middle line:84%
to us, but to try to bring
something through us.

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Many people say, I
just don't know who I am.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.030 align:middle line:90%
They don't know their soul.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.176 align:middle line:90%
They don't know their soul.

00:54:02.176 --> 00:54:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's great.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.970 align:middle line:84%
People think they can reach
out, get the cars, the jobs,

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the best relationships,
the money.

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:84%
People get that, and
more power to them.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But they still say to
themselves, I still feel empty.

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:14.610 align:middle line:90%
What's missing?

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.400 align:middle line:90%
You forgot about the soul.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's really
what we want.

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.270 align:middle line:84%
We want the grace and the
majesty and the presence of God

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to so fill us until
it's unspeakable

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.570 align:middle line:84%
because if we can speak
and call it something,

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.420 align:middle line:84%
we'll try to fix
it and change it.

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.160 align:middle line:90%
So we just want to be.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.495 align:middle line:84%
And in that being-ness
we have the manna,

00:54:36.495 --> 00:54:39.860 align:middle line:84%
which is the manifestation
of the presence of God.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:44.240 align:middle line:90%


00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
car or a house.

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:50.205 align:middle line:90%
It's about the presence of God.

00:54:50.205 --> 00:54:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Truly embodying
in the God presence

00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:00.510 align:middle line:84%
isn't just about being
saintly and having

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.650 align:middle line:84%
this upward connection
to the divine

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that we would call
mystical and enlightened.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But it also requires that
we fully inhabit our bodies

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and fully be in our
sensuality, our sexuality,

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and really combine and
fuse those energies.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Love is God.

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:15.600 align:middle line:90%
God is love.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:90%
So you are God.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.020 align:middle line:90%
You are love.

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you use that energy of
love, God will always say yes.

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:24.810 align:middle line:84%
He will manifest
exactly what you want.

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you can access
that feeling of oneness

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.980 align:middle line:84%
or the energy of
wholeness, what Jesus calls

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.050 align:middle line:84%
the kingdom of
heaven within you,

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:36.420 align:middle line:84%
then you can begin to
experience that all around you

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.450 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>But if we have an
idea that something

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.250 align:middle line:84%
other than the kingdom of God
is something we will seek after,

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that we will create
because we are so powerful,

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.150 align:middle line:84%
we will create in
our own illusion

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:49.267 align:middle line:84%
that which is not of the
heaven of which we dream.

00:55:49.267 --> 00:55:51.100 align:middle line:84%
That is, we'll create
our own hell on earth.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:56:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Moses and the code never
made it to the Holy Land.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And since then, Israel has
been in constant conflict.

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Millions have lost their lives
due to a misinterpretation

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:15.930 align:middle line:90%
of the name of God.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And religious factions have
been fighting for centuries,

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.720 align:middle line:90%
ironically, in the name of God.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.610 align:middle line:84%
The thousands of people
of all races and religions

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.650 align:middle line:84%
are flying in from all
corners of the world, armed

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:32.100 align:middle line:84%
with the powerful intent to
finally bring peace to the Holy

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.475 align:middle line:84%
Land by literally embracing
the Old City of Jerusalem.

00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:46.968 align:middle line:90%


00:56:46.968 --> 00:56:50.826 align:middle line:84%
>>At the time of the hug and
before, it is important for us

00:56:50.826 --> 00:56:53.966 align:middle line:84%
to keep our pure
intention and relax.

00:56:53.966 --> 00:56:57.333 align:middle line:90%


00:56:57.333 --> 00:56:59.495 align:middle line:84%
>>So we're walking
to the wall now,

00:56:59.495 --> 00:57:01.620 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to join
thousands of other people

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.796 align:middle line:84%
in circling the entire
Old City of Jerusalem.

00:57:05.796 --> 00:57:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Can we stretch the line?

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.532 align:middle line:90%
>>People, how are we doing?

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>We're here facing the wall,
so as you breath out, you say,

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I am that, meaning I am
that peace in Jerusalem.

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:27.428 align:middle line:84%

from this city.

later, Moses's journey

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.530 align:middle line:84%
is complete, by delivering the
true meaning of the name of God

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:18.835 align:middle line:90%
to the whole land.

00:58:18.835 --> 00:58:22.320 align:middle line:84%
It began with a conversation,

Now it's up to us to
step into a new world.
