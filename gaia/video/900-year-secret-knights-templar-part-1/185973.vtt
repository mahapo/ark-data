00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and
gentlemen, Freddy Silva.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.772 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:18.076 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.576 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA:
Thank you everybody.

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.723 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a conspiracy
theorist but since we're

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Knights Templar,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:84%
it's funny I got food
poisoning two days ago.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:84%
No one expects the
holy inquisition.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:90%
But here I am.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was weird.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:84%
No, it's funny because
people keep asking me,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
you have a very broad range
of interests in subjects.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
You go from crop
circles to sacred sites

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:90%
to resurrection to Templars.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And you think, what's
the connection?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I actually didn't know
until I actually stood back

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
from all of this and
looked at it in vitro

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and realized that yes, there
is a connection between all

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
of these subjects.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
it's all to do what

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times used to be
called the ancient mysteries,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:90%
or the ancient mystery secrets.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
All of these subjects are
related and tied together

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:90%
by that.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And these are secrets that
people back in the day

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:90%
would lay down their lives for.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes many actually
did lay down their lives

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:90%
to protect these secrets.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Not because they were
necessarily secret,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
it's just because the
information that they contained

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
was of such a nature
that it gave you

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:90%
a sense of self empowerment.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And back in the time, let's
say about 1,800 years ago when

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
the church was rising to
its dominancy in Europe,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.945 align:middle line:84%
this was a great challenge
to the status quo.

00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:10%
Because when you
have someone who

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:10%
wants to control a certain
method of thinking,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:10%
it basically outlaws
anything that falls outside

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:10%
of it's own sphere of belief.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So you would be
called a heretic.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you find yourself a
good present before Christmas,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
get yourself a really
good book on etymology,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
especially the "Oxford English
Dictionary on Etymology"

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:90%
from about the 1800s.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And look up heretic.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
It means someone in
possession of the facts who

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:90%
is able to choose.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the beginning.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Look up whore, midwife,
occult. And the list

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.982 align:middle line:90%
gets even stranger.

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
It's funny how all of
these sacred things

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
get turned upside down
by the winner isn't it?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So here we are today with
another strange connection

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%
with a story.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's all about the Templars.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:10%
And I'm actually going to beg
a certain forgiveness from you.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:10%
It's a very intense
presentation.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:10%
It took me 15 years to
sort out this story.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:10%
I thought I was just
writing a small book

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:10%
about the history of my
original country of birth,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:10%
which is Portugal.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can really tell
by the accent by the way.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the witness
protection program

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:90%
which I'm still--

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm now also an American
citizen just to confuse things.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So they like to keep
me moving around a bit.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this would be
a nice little easy subject,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
how the Templars got involved
with my country of birth.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And then something happened,
a piece of information

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.340 align:middle line:90%
which took me to Harvard.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I had to go and beg on
my knees to go to Harvard

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:90%
to use their library.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't just go in there
as a member of the public

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and just use the
Harvard Library.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
certain protocols.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they won't let
you unless you're actually

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:90%
a part of the actual community.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And even then, you'd be
very lucky if they even

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:90%
let you even sniff the door.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And somehow by an extraordinary
set of coincidences

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:90%
they let me in.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I found these books written
in original pen on, not paper,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
but back then they used
to use animal skin.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And these books, you
can't even find these

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:90%
in the archives in Portugal.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Harvard has no idea how
they ended up there.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was in these books
that I found something

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:84%
somewhere on page 680 because
they didn't have indexes

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're looking for
the one piece of information

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:84%
that just sets the
whole project alight.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And you've gone through
the whole 600 pages

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.693 align:middle line:84%
and you're going,
where is this going?

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you go hello,
that shouldn't be there.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.575 align:middle line:84%
How come we didn't
know about this.

00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
what should be a small project

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.500 align:middle line:84%
ends up being a 15 year
study of the Templars,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the origin of the Templars,
and something that history

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:90%
has never really put together.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I'm
going to be doing today.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because
the Templars are also

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
a challenge to our modern
way of perceiving things.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I was at Laguardia Airport
yesterday grabbing some lunch.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:90%
And the irony just hit me.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting at a table.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
There's an iPad
bolted at a table.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.343 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking for
a waiter or waitress.

00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody around.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to do everything
on this screen.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.170 align:middle line:90%
You order on the screen.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:90%
The food comes.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:90%
You pay with a card.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
People are sitting there
attached to their iPads.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
The kids are playing blackjack
on the iPads, and they're five.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And people are totally
engrossed in Kindles and things.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, we're looking
for this instant gratification

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet here's a subject that's
going to demand even today

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:90%
your total full attention.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Because as you probably
well know, in order

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
to get something out of life,
nothing really comes that easy.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to put
an effort into it.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So you are going to
be part of this today.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.028 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
a hell of a headache.

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And to try and ease
things a little bit,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I've put up 150 pictures
to go with this.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So it will make it
a little bit easier.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So here's the core
of what I'm trying

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to get at today, the fact that
the search for enlightenment

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and self empowerment and
the mystery of the soul

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
isn't necessarily a
modern preoccupation.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
This is something we're
striving for today.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's odd to think that
a group of warrior monks

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
back in the 12th
century were looking

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:90%
for exactly the same thing.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was a preoccupation
for a small group of nobles

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and monks, many of them
were really not very high

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:90%
ranking at all.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they weren't
even that well-known.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be
a sort of sideline

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the period.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's a surprise
to me because

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.133 align:middle line:84%
of what we know
about the Templars

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that these people should have
been involved with something

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
incredibly spiritual.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We seem to get the
opposite side of the story

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
because all we get
about the Templars is

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that they went to Jerusalem to
liberate the holy sepulcher.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing a lot
of fighting with the Arabs.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be
different from the truth.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.612 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of
them didn't actually

00:06:34.612 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:90%
do any fighting at all.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:84%
They actually worked like
a ministerial college,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.323 align:middle line:90%
very different.

00:06:39.323 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we need to
do is separate the crusaders

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:90%
from the Templars.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:90%
The two are not the same thing.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So to try and solve
this complex story,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.775 align:middle line:90%
I've broken it into two parts.

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
The first part of
this morning, I

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about the
biggest secrets which

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
also happens to be the
least known accomplishment.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot believe that it's
taken an alternative author

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and researcher to actually
figure this out when the facts

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:90%
are all there.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.808 align:middle line:84%
I guess it always takes someone
from the outside looking in

00:07:06.808 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:90%
to see the bigger picture.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's a huge accomplishment.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And the second part
of the presentation, I

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
wanted to find
out what motivated

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:90%
them to do this accomplishment.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
What was behind their
whole motivation?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And how does it
relate to the most

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:90%
secret of spiritual rituals?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Something that has been going
on for at least 5,000 years,

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and it sort of culminates
with a very interesting fellow

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
called Jesus Christ who
gets all the credit for it.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't the center
of the attention at all

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:90%
as we'll find out.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what
if anything does

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:90%
it have to do with the Grail.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as you start
scratching the Templars,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.147 align:middle line:84%
you can't but help
touch the Grail itself.

00:07:50.147 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:90%
But what is the Grail all about?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:84%
What really is the
whole story behind that?

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And I do promise
you, there are not

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
going to be any Monty Python
jokes all the way through this.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.681 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:10%
The guy-- no one expects
the holy inquisition, right?

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.315 align:middle line:10%
Don't get me started.

00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:10%
I might not be
feeling that well,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:10%
but I'm still quite punchy.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, in case you're not
familiar with the story.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:10%
Here's the popular
version of how

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:10%
the Templar story came about.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:10%
We're in Jerusalem in 1118.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:10%
The Christians have
just basically taken

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:10%
over from the Arabs,
and Saracens and Turks

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:10%
and all other local people the
proprietorship of the town.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
And on a particular day,
the king of Jerusalem

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
receives a visit from two men
dressed in very plain clothing,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.376 align:middle line:84%
two minor nobles that no
one's ever heard of and no one

00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:90%
really should care about.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And their names are Hugues
de Payens and Godfrey

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:90%
de Saint-Omer.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And whatever these two
men pitch to the King,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
they pitch them
a wonderful story

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
because the king of Jerusalem
suddenly says, oh, absolutely.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'll give up
my house on the Temple

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'll move out of there
and let you guys move in.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And you start reading
this, and you think,

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
something here
doesn't quite add up.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And from that very
moment on, these two men

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
dressed in very old clothing
bring in seven of their buddies

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and they move into
these quarters.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And from thereafter are
known as the Knights Templar.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
What a strange start
to a bizarre story.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
The official reason
is even more bizarre.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Because you probably know
that the official story

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:84%
behind the forming
of the Templars

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
was to protect the 33 mile
pilgrim trail which back then

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
went from Jaffa on
the coast of what

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:90%
was then Palestine to Jerusalem.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:84%
When they finished
protecting the pilgrim trail,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
they then returned
to Europe under very

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
mysterious circumstances to
become the richest organization

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:90%
of the period.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think their
total combined accounts

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.242 align:middle line:84%
totalled something like $2
billion in today's money.

00:10:12.242 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It was something
extraordinary back then.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It was unthinkable.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.142 align:middle line:84%
And that pretty much
is the accepted version

00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:84%
of events surrounding
the birth and the purpose

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%
of the Templars.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.078 align:middle line:84%
They were there to
protect the pilgrim path.

00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:90%
They made a lot of money.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
They went back to
Europe, end of story.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And then as we know, a couple
of centuries later the church

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
decided to take them out
along with the King of France.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
went underground.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
They disappeared,
vanished from history.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is absolutely
no evidence at all

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that these nine
men ever patrolled

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
such a long dangerous
road between sea and city.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they hardly
spent any time outside

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:90%
of Temple Mount itself.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And considering that you have
nine men patrolling 33 miles

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
from brigands, very
annoyed Arabs who just lost

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
their lands, mountain lions, and
all kinds of nefarious people

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to steal
money from pilgrims,

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
this story sounds a
little bit strange.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
It almost sounds
like a smokescreen.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Even more so when you consider
that the policing of that trail

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
had already been undertaken for
30 years prior to the Templars

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
by another group called
the Knights Hospitallers.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And they had been formed several
decades before the Templars.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the two
organizations later

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:90%
went on to work with each other.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that the
Templars, these nine men

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
supposedly spent all of their
time secreted on Temple Mount,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:90%
doing what?

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, they spent all their
time digging tunnels.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's been proven
in the last 30 years

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:90%
by Israeli archeologists.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
They even found some of
their artifacts still buried

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
in some of these
tunnels that they

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
dug in a radial pattern
from a certain location

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.790 align:middle line:84%
as though they were trying to
find something very specific.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
They had a fair idea where
it was but not quite exactly.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So one has to question the
logic of this entire story.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Why would nine rich nobles give
up all their wealth, travel

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
1,500 miles across Europe,
across very treacherous terrain

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:84%
back then to sit in Jerusalem
in hot humid putrid conditions,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
digging tunnels under very
unpleasant circumstances

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.305 align:middle line:90%
to find a wealth of treasure?

00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It would have been easier
just to sit at home

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
in their former counties
of Burgundy and Lorraine,

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:84%
what is today
Belgium, and sit there

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
with their inherited wealth
and have a quiet happy life.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Men just don't give
up their wealth

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:90%
to dig tunnels and become rich.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't add up.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So again, the idea
that a smokescreen

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
was set up behind the
Templars is very evident.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
What happens next is
even more bizarre.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:84%
In 1121, apparently they
found a very mysterious scroll

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:90%
hidden on the Temple Mount.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And this scroll was
given safe passage

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
all the way through the
lands of central Europe

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.340 align:middle line:84%
all the way to
southern Belgium to be

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:84%
decrypted by a cryptographer
called Lambert de Saint-Omer.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would you
need a cryptographer

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
to decrypt a scroll that was
found on the Temple Mount?

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Another mystery in itself.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 1125, they
discovered something else

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of considerable importance.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly they
all hastily begin

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
to pack up their
meager belongings

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:90%
and then return back to Europe.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.280 align:middle line:84%
After that they are
formally sanctioned

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
by the pope in a very bizarre
conference where they actually

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
weren't even top of the agenda.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment at
the Council of Troyes,

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
the famous Council
of Troyes, they

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.588 align:middle line:90%
become sanctioned by the pope.

00:13:45.588 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And they are basically
given the fact

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.923 align:middle line:84%
that they can
proceed as planned,

00:13:48.923 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and they are given the whole
blessing of the church,

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
even though the
Templars themselves

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
were no friends of the
church to begin with.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You see how funny this
story is becoming?

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the fact that
the place where they actually

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
were sanctioned was
the town of Troyes.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, it happens
to be the same town where

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
a few years later
a poet sat down

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.725 align:middle line:84%
to write the most famous
grail story of all time.

00:14:13.725 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So you start piecing
all these bits together,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.392 align:middle line:84%
and you think, there's
something more going

00:14:17.392 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:90%
on here than meets the eye.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
There's something
much more interesting.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where I
begin to sort of jump in.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out,
is there another story

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:90%
that's going on there?

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
One that is even more incredible
but also more credible.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the facts so
far are very jumbled up,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and they don't seem
to make any sense.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
seven years before taking up

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
residence on Temple
Mount, the proto Templars

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
were already present
and materially active

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
in another land 2,000 miles
to the west of Jerusalem,

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
on the other opposite side of
Jerusalem in this little town

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:90%
called Porto Cale.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the area that's
known today as Portugal.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Of course, back then, none
of this stuff even existed.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:90%
These names don't exist.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.933 align:middle line:84%
So what are these Templar
Knights doing so far

00:15:06.933 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of Europe?

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:90%
They shouldn't even be there.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's no
evidence they ever

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.253 align:middle line:90%
existed outside of Jerusalem.

00:15:13.253 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
to keep in mind is

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that by design this
previously known enterprise

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that I discovered became
their greatest accomplishment.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Because what they were
doing in this little county

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
on the far side of Europe
was that they were creating

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Europe's first nation state.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Another first that is never
mentioned in history books.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So with these ideas
in mind, I'm now

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
going to reveal another unknown
chapter in the Templar history.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I want do so
starting with symbols.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Because symbols are so much fun.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:90%
They're mysterious.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And anything that's mysterious
always gets our curiosity.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And secret societies,
they love their symbols

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
because just like parables
to the casual viewer,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:90%
they convey one message.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:84%
While to the initiate
of the mysteries,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:90%
they can conceal another.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And in a world of corrupt
clergymen and kings,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
symbols prove to be the most
safest method of transmitting

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:84%
important ideas, or for
initiates to also exchange

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:90%
signals with one another.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And in this respect, the
Templars were no different.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at their
buildings, their talismans,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and their seals, their lives
encoded with symbolic language,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:90%
and it's timeless.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:90%
It's full of secrets.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
But to someone who is actually
immersed in the mysteries,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
it can be as easy to
unravel as a nursery rhyme.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Take this symbol for example.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are probably
familiar with it.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the famous seal
of a Templar showing

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:84%
the two knights who
are so poor that they

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:90%
had to ride one horse.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Any historian worth
his money will

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
know that this is
such a stupid idea.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
If you go into battle with
two guys riding on a horse,

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:90%
it's going to slow you down.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
shot with an arrow.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really add up.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that these
people weren't poor anyway.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
There were wealthy
to begin with.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
They gave up their money
and they put it in a trust.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't poor
knights to begin with.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
They pooled their resources
and put it in a trust

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
so others could benefit from
their cause, another mystery.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:84%
The truth behind the
symbol is that you

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
have two knights
riding the horse,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
is that it represents
the duality of the self.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
You have the dark and the
light side of the personality.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was
that when you find

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
the balance between
the two, that

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
is the focal point of when you
find the center of the mystery

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:90%
secrets.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a balanced
person to understand the biggest

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.450 align:middle line:90%
mysteries of the universe.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Without it, you're
just basically using

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
the information for ego.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would the balance of
the self be riding a horse.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you may be familiar
with another symbol in the East

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:90%
called a Sphinx.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
That in esoteric
teachings has always

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
been a place which is
symbolically lying on top

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:90%
of a hall of records, OK?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's a symbol
of buried knowledge.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, the counterpart in
ancient traditions to the Sphinx

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:90%
is the white horse.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And you often see this
in Celtic mythology,

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
in Christian ideology.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Whenever Gabriel rides
to meet human beings

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
with a message from God,
he always rides a horse.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is what it means.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
You have two
Templars representing

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
the light and the
dark side of the self

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
in perfect equilibrium riding
the horse of knowledge, very

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.500 align:middle line:90%
powerful statement right there.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you're
not part of that school,

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:90%
you would never understand this.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, words can also be symbolic.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:10%
We talk a lot about Templars
looking for treasure, looking

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.552 align:middle line:10%
for a money tree treasure.

00:18:46.552 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:10%
It's a very interesting word
because the origin of the word

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:10%
treasure is "thesauro."

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:10%
And it literally means a
storehouse, a valued item.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:10%
And it is the root of our
modern word, thesaurus,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:10%
which of course is a book of
words, a literary treasure.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:10%
So perhaps what the Templars
may have been looking for,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:10%
because we have all of these
stories about how they found

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.455 align:middle line:10%
hidden scrolls underneath
the temple mount

00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:10%
is that the stuff that
they were looking for,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:10%
the treasure they were
looking for was not material.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a treasure
of words, possibly.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we keep talking about
how they found these scrolls.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:84%
They had to be
decrypted by people

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
who understood certain
symbolic language, something

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:90%
else to consider.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Or how about this one?

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:10%
This is an anagram.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:10%
It is the royal seal placed
by the King of Portugal

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:10%
just after Portugal is created.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.270 align:middle line:10%
And it's found on a
Charter of 1159 issued

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:10%
by the first King of Portugal.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:10%
And in this charter, he
awards the Templars 1/3

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:10%
of his newly conquered country.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, that's a hell of a birthday
present to give someone.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:10%
You just spent
half of your life--

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:10%
this guy was 17 years old by the
way, this King, pretty young.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, kids had to
grow up very quickly back

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:10%
in those days.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we're talking about
serious warfare in the Middle

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:10%
Ages.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:10%
And he just clears
out the territory

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:10%
from all kinds of foes.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.335 align:middle line:10%
He puts the Portuguese
nation together.

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And what do you know,
I think I'll just

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
hand a third of my country
to the Knights Templar.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, none of this
seems to add up totally.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So what he does with
his seal, he essentially

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
sanctions and gives
them the greatest slice

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
of real estate in history.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's a piece of real estate
called the territory of Ceres.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It is literally named after
the goddess of fertility, which

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:90%
is a big clue right there.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And it eventually would
become the location

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Templars' most
important temples,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
even to this very day, their
most important structures

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:90%
are still there.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where the
symbols get exciting.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:84%
To the casual viewer,
the King's circular seal

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:84%
obviously shows
the word Portugal

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:90%
written out as an anagram.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, look closer.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're an
esoteric reader, you

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
see something a
little bit deeper,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:84%
you begin to read
the word portu gral.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Now the gral of course
is the original grail

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.938 align:middle line:90%
in its original French form.

00:21:09.938 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But there's another level of
information concealed here

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because secret societies
love to put things

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:84%
in different layers
of information.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
To the initiate
of the mysteries,

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:90%
it is actually a phrase.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So once you put that together,
it means por tu o gral.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.592 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be Portuguese
to understand what that means.

00:21:27.592 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Thank god I can still
speak the language.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it literally
means, through you,

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:90%
the Grail, oh, Susanna.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is hidden, stamped on
a seal that gives the Templars

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:90%
a huge piece of real estate.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Is the King of Portugal,
this newly founded country

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in the 12th century
telling us that the land

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
he just donated to the Templars
is the location of the grail?

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.342 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:21:52.342 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Here is the principle
setting for this mystery.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:10%
It's the town of Thamara.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautiful place.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:10%
I take groups there regularly.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:10%
There's a very good cafe just
at the bottom of the street.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:10%
When you get to
Portugal, any tour

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:10%
has to be based
around 5 to 12 visits

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:10%
to coffee shops, pastry shops.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:10%
You know, we might get some
work done in between them.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:10%
It's part of the culture,
we call it research.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.143 align:middle line:84%
Competitive and the
kind of research

00:22:20.143 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:84%
you do in Britain
which is usually

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:90%
around pubs in Scotland.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
They call them
research facilities.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how
much work gets done.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 12th century,
this beautiful little town

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:90%
was called Thamara.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's an Arabic name.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars and the Arabs
get along very well together

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:90%
despite what you might hear.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
connection between them.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And the name in Arabic
literally means "palm tree."

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And usually towns
back in the old days

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:84%
were given names to
because it depicted

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:90%
something about the area.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I did a little bit of
work on their climatology

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and I found that the period
in which all this took place

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
was too cold to allow palm
trees to actually grow there.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So why would you name a
town after a type of tree

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
that never grew there?

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Very bizarre.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It even gets weirder when
you think about its name

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
when it becomes written in
Portuguese, which is tomar,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:90%
which literally means to drink.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, how do you go
about drinking a town?

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:10%
It's though they're
leaving little clues

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:10%
to be figured out later.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, something
else about this name

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:10%
also starts getting
suspicions going

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:10%
that they were obviously hiding
something in plain sight.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Because Thamara happens to
be the name of the daughter

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:10%
of a woman to whom
the Templars dedicated

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:10%
a disproportionate
amount of churches.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And that woman was
Mary Magdalene.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you go
throughout Europe,

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
they built countless
amount of temples.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
They re-erected
ancient sacred sites.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And the disproportionate
amount was

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to this woman that was
totally vilified by the church,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
marginalized.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, certainly the
Templars were privy

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
to a great number of
secrets, including

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.803 align:middle line:84%
much outlawed or
heretical information.

00:24:06.803 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know
what heretic means,

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:90%
we can sympathize.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.010 align:middle line:84%
They were actually in
possession of very important

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
spiritual knowledge
which someone

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:90%
didn't want you to know.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the secrets was
actually carelessly revealed

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
by the Knight Galvais de
Beauvais when he was carelessly

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.670 align:middle line:90%
caught escaping France.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And he was caught by
the holy inquisition.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.555 align:middle line:84%
I can't help getting into
Monty Python really, can you?

00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:84%
You can just see him
scurrying through France

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:90%
trying to get to La Fleche.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly no one expects
the holy inquisition.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Come in for some
polite questioning.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you go in
for some polite questioning.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And during this
questioning, and believe me,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.180 align:middle line:84%
this is the least
horrible of the pictures

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I found on the questioning
methods of the inquisition.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is what he revealed
after they were giving him

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:90%
the third degree.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And I quote, "There
exists in the Order

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
a law so extraordinary on
which such a secret should

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
be kept that any Knight would
prefer his head cut off rather

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:90%
than reveal it to anyone."

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty serious.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And most of these people did.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:90%
They lived by this truth.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But many of them went to their
grave protecting everything.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was true, the Order did
keep a secret book, especially

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
within the inner
brotherhood of the Templars.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And its contents
could not be revealed

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:84%
beyond the inner brotherhood
along with an unspecified item

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
in something called the
rule of the elected brothers

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that should anyone else read
it, its members would kill them.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty
serious about this.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.938 align:middle line:84%
It was so secret, so important
that even if the King of France

00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
got hold of this, they
would actually assassinate

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:90%
the King of France himself.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So what was this secret?

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Why was it worth
protecting with your life

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and also worth killing
for at same time.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, bear this in mind.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
The church in the time
was scared of two things.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're still scared
of these two things by the way.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Although, I have to give
credit to the latest pope.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
I actually kind of like him.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.277 align:middle line:84%
He seems to be making
the right gestures.

00:26:12.277 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So I want to cut him a
little slack on this.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.197 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.197 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that they were
scared that people would find

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:10%
was that Jesus
was a mere mortal,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:10%
and that his life
story had been grafted

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:10%
to fit the profile of 23
earlier resurrected god-men.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:90%
And you heard that right.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
There are at least
23 known god-men

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
who get nailed to a cross,
figuratively speaking,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
on the winter solstice,
get up three days later,

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and they go about to
create a new religion.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The story is as old
as the wall of China.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is older
than the wall of China

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:84%
because they were practicing
that same ritual there

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:90%
in 2,800 BC.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's another story,
another book altogether.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
They were also concerned
that people would find out

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:90%
that he had children.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And that the lineage had
survived along with him.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that all of this would
become public knowledge,

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:84%
because as you can imagine, this
would be a huge embarrassment

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to the way that the church
had posited the whole story.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that they
were very concerned about,

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and this certainly
came out in 1947

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
when certain secret
scrolls were found

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:90%
buried in Nag Hammadi in Egypt.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And they spent something like
$13 million at a low estimate,

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to make sure that
this stuff didn't come out.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
of course, it did.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was all to do with the
discovery of gnostic gospels.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And these gnostic
gospels were very damning

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:84%
because they revealed the
true nature behind the meaning

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.105 align:middle line:90%
of the resurrection.

00:27:43.105 --> 00:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And if people find out
about the true meaning

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of the resurrection, they would
undermine their entire office

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So bearing this
in mind, let's see

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.860 align:middle line:84%
what was going on in
the early 12th century

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and see how all of
these worlds collided

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:90%
in a very interesting manner.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Here we are in 11th
century Europe.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're not familiar with
geography, it's very simple.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Because back in
this time period,

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
there were literally no
countries to speak of.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.910 align:middle line:90%
France didn't exist.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Spain didn't exist.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:90%
There was no Italy,

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Germany is a bunch of
little kingdoms, Duchies.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
fighting each other.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
They're all struggling
for ownership, fiefdoms

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:90%
and kingdoms.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's so confusing.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Just accept the fact it
was one great big mess.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:90%
It really was.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.447 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it took
me six months just

00:28:27.447 --> 00:28:29.665 align:middle line:84%
to untangle the different
marriages and lineages

00:28:29.665 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and connections and friendships
and hatreds that were going on.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't even
make up this stuff.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And Portugal of course,
didn't even exist back then.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But you did have this
tiny little county

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:84%
on the Western point of the
Iberean peninsula called

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:90%
the county of Portucale.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the end of
the 11th century,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:84%
a young French knight
called Henri of Burgundy,

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and Burgundy again was
another little duchy

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
in what would today be
the center of France

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and a very advanced and
enlightened part of Europe

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
They were light years
ahead of anybody

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
because they had acquired so
much wisdom from the Arabs who

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:84%
themselves were also light
years ahead of Europe back then.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So they worked very closely
with catalysts and people

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery schools.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So the center of Burgundy
which is just north

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
of where Languedoc
is on the map,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.387 align:middle line:84%
it was a center
of enlightenment.

00:29:21.387 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And out of the center
of enlightenment

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
comes actually, quite
a tall knight riding

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.820 align:middle line:90%
towards the Iberian Peninsula.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, after giving
some favors to a local King,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:84%
he inherits this little county
for himself as a wedding gift.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not bad for a
couple of months work.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And here he is, dashing
fellow, Henri of Portugal.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
He becomes known as
Count Henri of Portucale.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And he settles down with
his lovely new wife.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:53.232 align:middle line:84%
He starts maintaining
his little territory.

00:29:53.232 --> 00:29:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful
part of the world.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.565 align:middle line:84%
They make some of the
best wine in the world.

00:29:56.565 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is, we tend
to keep it for ourselves.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:84%
In 1100, in 1103, Count
Henry, as we call him,

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:84%
he decides to take two
journeys to Jerusalem.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:90%
He goes on pilgrimage.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's very opportune
because the city had just

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:90%
been liberated.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1103,
that also coincides

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:84%
with the arrival in
Jerusalem of a certain man

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:middle line:84%
called Hugues de Payens, the
future Templar Grand Master.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.700 align:middle line:10%
And these two men originated
from the same duchy

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:10%
in the center of
what today is France.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:10%
Both men also apparently
shared a vision

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:10%
of creating a brand new
kingdom of conscience

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:10%
answerable to nobody except
god itself, not religion,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:10%
not any creator, but
to this whole source

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:10%
of creation itself, or
free from any entanglement.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.440 align:middle line:10%
So in a small place like
Jerusalem was back then,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:10%
it's very likely that these
men sharing different sources

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.170 align:middle line:10%
and different ideas,
possibly forged

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.630 align:middle line:10%
a very close relationship.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:10%
Well, certainly Count Henry
was in Jerusalem long enough,

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:10%
for two years, to make
sure that plans were made.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:10%
And he returns to
Portucale whereupon

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.900 align:middle line:10%
he begins to expand this little
territory all the way down

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.150 align:middle line:10%
to the city of Lisbon today.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And he begins to do
this thanks to a group

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.460 align:middle line:84%
of a knights who
mysteriously came back

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:90%
with him from Jerusalem.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1114, he
mysteriously passes away,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:84%
just one of those
unfortunate incidences.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.135 align:middle line:84%
His son and successor was
only six years of age.

00:31:28.135 --> 00:31:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can
particularly imagine,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:90%
this posed a huge problem.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.950 align:middle line:84%
The kid is too young to take
over the role of government.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So whatever plans had been
made between Henri and Hugues

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:84%
de Payens had to be put on
hold for the time being.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile in Jerusalem, the
Templars go very, very quiet.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
There's not one shred of
documentation from this period

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:90%
to show what they were up to.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But the order of
the temple appears

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.047 align:middle line:90%
to be in its embryonic stage.

00:31:54.047 --> 00:31:55.880 align:middle line:84%
We know that Hugues de
Payens was struggling

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.270 align:middle line:90%
to form a brotherhood.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
We know that he was
asking for help.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:84%
We know that he was finding it
very difficult to find knights

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:84%
who would go to Jerusalem
on a means to find a faith,

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.700 align:middle line:84%
not to just go fight Arabs
and claim land for themselves.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.797 align:middle line:84%
And back then, there was
a lot of glory hounds

00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:90%
in this part of the world.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people were
bankrupt all around Europe.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So to find that one spiritual
person, man or woman

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:90%
in the crowd, was tough going.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:90%
So he gets very, very quiet.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And then he suddenly reappears
in very dramatic fashion

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.870 align:middle line:90%
in 1116.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And his signature
appears on a document.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is co-signed with a
prior called Petrus Anuldus who

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the prior
of a nearby Abbey of Notre

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Dame of Mount Sion.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And in this document Hugues
de Payens and this prior

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:84%
declare that good relations are
assured between our two orders.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, this implies that two
years before the Templars

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.590 align:middle line:84%
became an official organization,
Hugues de Payens had apparently

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:84%
already formed some
kind of brotherhood,

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.970 align:middle line:90%
obviously stated right here.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was working with
another equally secretive order

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.520 align:middle line:84%
of monks that were residing in
this mysterious abbey on Mount

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Sion just outside the
walls of Jerusalem.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
mysterious organization

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:84%
that in recent times a book
called "Holy Blood, Holy Grail"

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.113 align:middle line:90%
made much work on.

00:33:23.113 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
them to the fore.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And you may remember that they
were also taken to the cleaners

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:84%
by several interested groups
who spent a fortune putting out

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.670 align:middle line:84%
information that
the Order of Sion

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:90%
was a fictitious organization.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It eventually becomes known
as the Priory of Sion.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It eventually ends up in the "Da
Vinci Code," the fictional book

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:90%
by Dan Brown.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.572 align:middle line:84%
Who by the way was my
ex-neighbor in New Hampshire.

00:33:46.572 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You know what, it
never rubbed off on me.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm still waiting to have
my one millionth book sale.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:90%
It has never quite rubbed off.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:84%
We used to walk by
the beach at low tide.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.527 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell two
frustrated writers.

00:34:01.527 --> 00:34:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Because one of them was walking
around the beach looking

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:84%
at the path and in the
sky where inspiration

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
falls down and drops down
mysteriously on your head.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.929 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
looking at the sand looking

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:13.730 align:middle line:84%
where inspiration
rises out of the water

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.380 align:middle line:90%
to come into your body.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And you go past each other, and
you say, good afternoon, yes,

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:90%
nice afternoon for a walk.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Good to get out
and clear the head.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.761 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and
it's only later when

00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:84%
you look at his
picture on the book

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, that was
my neighbor, unbelievable.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Nice guy actually.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:32.420 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns
out that there are

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:84%
historical documents actually
validating the Order of Sion,

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
even documents written by
the King of France himself.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.312 align:middle line:84%
So if this organization didn't
exist, the King of France

00:34:45.312 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:84%
must have been smoking
something pretty special

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:84%
to be ordering documents to
a fictitious organization.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I love how history
works sometimes.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So if this is an equally
mysterious organization,

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.090 align:middle line:84%
let's find out more
about this co-signatory.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out who
this prior actually is.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, remember when I was
saying a few minutes ago

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:10%
that back when Count Henry sails
to Jerusalem from Portucale,

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:10%
he was accompanied
by a young man who

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.770 align:middle line:10%
also originated from his
original county of Burgundy.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.740 align:middle line:10%
And his family was
called the de la Roche.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:10%
And this family was a
well-to-do family of the period.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.710 align:middle line:10%
They were supporters and
very enlightened people

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.960 align:middle line:10%
who supported an
upcoming order of monks

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:10%
called the Cistercians.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.700 align:middle line:10%
If you want to find out
everything about the Templars,

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:10%
look up the Cistercians
and find out everything

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:10%
you want to know about
their future abbot, Bernard

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.070 align:middle line:10%
of Clairvaux, one of the
most intensely religious

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.930 align:middle line:10%
and original Christian
people you'll ever

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.460 align:middle line:10%
find on the face of the Earth.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:10%
Because you understand
Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.320 align:middle line:10%
you understand the
head of the Templars

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:10%
and the linchpin of the
entire Templar organization.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I found and read all of
his 500 surviving letters.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you, I
got under this guy's skin.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle line:84%
This guy was a complete
genius, very humble as well.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So this family, the
de la Roche obviously,

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
were betting on a
very strong horse.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.640 align:middle line:84%
They recognized
that the Cistercians

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.130 align:middle line:84%
were going to be a great
force to be reckoned with.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day the
la Roche family

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
decides to emigrate to the
little county of Portucale.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And Madame de la
Roche gives birth

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:20.780 align:middle line:90%
to a son called Pierre Arnolde.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And they give birth to
him in a little town

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:90%
in what would become Portugal.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And this man, this
young son is the man

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:32.090 align:middle line:84%
who sailed to Jerusalem
with Count Henry.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And they know him in Portugal by
his other name, Pierre Arnolde

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:36.860 align:middle line:90%
de la Roche.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking in
three tongues today by the way.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I expect you to remember all
of this stuff, three languages.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, Arnolde's arrival in
Jerusalem with Count Henri

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.820 align:middle line:10%
was very timely.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:10%
Because it happens to
coincide with the monks

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:10%
of the Order of Sion
moving into their rebuilt

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.010 align:middle line:10%
abbey on Mount Sion.

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.640 align:middle line:10%
He joins the order.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:10%
And this gave young Pedro
Arnolde immense leverage

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:10%
because the abbey had already
established close ties with two

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.910 align:middle line:10%
knights living in the nearby
Church of the Holy Sepulcher,

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.760 align:middle line:10%
and their names are, Hugues
de Payens and Godfrey

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:10%
de Saint-Omer, the nucleus
of the tight Knights Templar.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have a direct
relationship and documentation

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:84%
going on between the Order of
Sion and the formative Templar

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Knights.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And proof of this
relationship is

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.130 align:middle line:84%
in that document which is
signed by Hugues de Payens

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.875 align:middle line:84%
because that
co-signatory, prior Pedro

00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Arnaldo is none other than
Pedro Arnolde written in Latin.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.910 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of illiteracy
back in the 12th century.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But the few people
who were literate,

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:84%
they had to sometimes write
in three different languages,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:90%
their own, and also in Latin.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:90%
And whats the third one?

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:52.687 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:84%
They usually wrote things
in three different ways,

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:84%
which makes research
really, really difficult.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes you're looking
at the same person three times.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And you think, these are
three different people.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But they're not really
the same person.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, prior to
Arnolde's position--

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.520 align:middle line:90%
no, let me go back on that.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Prior Arnolde's position was
actually much more powerful

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:90%
than is historically known.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.877 align:middle line:84%
Because we actually know
very little about this guy.

00:38:17.877 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:90%
He's like a footnote in history.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Early chroniclers of
the period, And this

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is when Harvard can be very
useful to find these previously

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.070 align:middle line:90%
unknown documents.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Early chroniclers
cite this man as one

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of the original
Templars in Jerusalem,

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
as well as the key founder
of the Knights Templar

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:90%
in the county of Portucale.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I read in
one of these documents written

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.450 align:middle line:90%
on animal skin.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It says, Arnolde de Roche
who was a Templar Knight

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.990 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first
nine originators

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:52.108 align:middle line:84%
of this illustrious order
of the temple in Jerusalem.

00:38:52.108 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:84%
This guy is never mentioned
in any of the history books

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.450 align:middle line:84%
as being a Templar Knight,
completely out of the picture.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And the writer
who wrote this, he

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.550 align:middle line:84%
would have known because he was
himself a Portuguese Templar

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Knight.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.475 align:middle line:84%
We're getting this straight
from the horse's mouth.

00:39:07.475 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:84%
He would not be
lying about this.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is explosive
material because this guy

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:84%
has never, ever been listed
as one of the original Templar

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Knights.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.210 align:middle line:84%
He is nothing more than
a footnote in history.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
He is a footnote in
Portuguese history, let alone

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.790 align:middle line:90%
any other kind of history.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And yet.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that he becomes
the key figure in how

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.050 align:middle line:84%
the Templars gained access
to what would become

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:32.110 align:middle line:90%
the future kingdom of Portugal.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.420 align:middle line:10%
Let me summarize all
of this because it gets

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.530 align:middle line:10%
a bit confusing after a while.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.150 align:middle line:10%
Here's a man who is the
head of the Order of Sion.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.270 align:middle line:10%
The Order of Sion were
absolutely materially involved

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:10%
in the creation of
the Knights Templar.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.440 align:middle line:10%
In fact, half the
Knights Templar

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:10%
can know be revealed
to have been

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.100 align:middle line:10%
also members of
the Order of Sion,

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.780 align:middle line:10%
as well as Cistercian monks.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.060 align:middle line:10%
They had three jobs
at the same time.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.770 align:middle line:10%
And the documents
that were found

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:10%
by the writers of the
"Holy Blood, Holy Grail"

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:10%
found that the stated
claim, and the stated aim

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.690 align:middle line:10%
of the Order of Sion
and the Priory of Sion

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:10%
was to protect a holy
bloodline at all costs.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.325 align:middle line:10%
This is the actual
stated aim of the order.

00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:10%
The other thing
about this guy is

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.300 align:middle line:10%
that his family assisted the
abbot, Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual leader
of the Templars,

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.950 align:middle line:10%
in fact, the very man
who would handpick

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:10%
many of the original knights.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.930 align:middle line:10%
He was also born
on Portuguese soil.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.780 align:middle line:10%
He was a friend and confidant
of the Count of Portucale,

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.360 align:middle line:10%
and he's a co-founder
of the Knights Templar.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.780 align:middle line:10%
Talk about one helluva
well-positioned guy.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.208 align:middle line:90%
And no one knows about him.

00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:38.750 align:middle line:84%
This is why it took 15 years to
research because suddenly you

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:44.020 align:middle line:84%
go, hello, this is going in
a very different direction.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.580 align:middle line:84%
In essence, this
guy was the linchpin

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:49.720 align:middle line:84%
between all of these
related houses and orders.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:10%
So all of this new
information now brings up

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.750 align:middle line:10%
another unsettling
question, were the Templars

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.020 align:middle line:10%
present in Portucale long
before the official founding

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:10%
date of 1118?

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:10%
Aha, it turns out
that rare sources

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.450 align:middle line:10%
claimed that the
Templars already

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:10%
were active in this county
following Count Henri's

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:10%
return from
Jerusalem, which means

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:10%
that 13 years before the
Templars were known to have

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.990 align:middle line:10%
existed, they are
already materially

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.480 align:middle line:10%
active on the other
side of Europe.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.080 align:middle line:10%
But the best evidence comes from
an actual property donation.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:10%
And you can't get better
than getting your hands

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:10%
on a real document that shows a
transaction, an actual business

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:10%
transaction.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.080 align:middle line:10%
And they still have this in
Portugal, incredibly enough.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.380 align:middle line:10%
And I found this document.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:10%
And it's for a
property donation.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:41.050 align:middle line:10%
And not just any property
donation, it's a castle.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:44.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a big property donation
along with half a town.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:10%
And it was given to
the order of the temple

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:50.410 align:middle line:10%
by Count Henri himself in 1111.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:10%
Oh, dear, because
this single-handedly

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:10%
places the Proto Templars firmly
in the county of Portucale

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:10%
seven years before they
appeared on temple mound.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:10%
It changes the whole course
of history in one go.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.110 align:middle line:10%
And they certainly
had a foothold there.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:09.910 align:middle line:10%
Because shortly after he
passes away, Count Henry,

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:10%
he signs another document
providing the Templars

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.050 align:middle line:10%
with a second property.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is a key residence
in the city of Braga,

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:84%
which as it turns out,
is not just any old city.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that it's the
oldest known city in Europe.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.580 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
is that the Templars

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:84%
began quietly
amassing properties

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.220 align:middle line:90%
in and around this city.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, eventually, it
becomes their headquarters,

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:84%
not so much Jerusalem, this is
where they were all hiding out.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And one later
Templar master even

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:90%
stated this in his own words.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Let me say what he says.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:90%
He says,

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING LATIN]

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Yep, come on, get your
apps out, come on.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.830 align:middle line:84%
If your Latin is as
scruffy as mine is,

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:01.040 align:middle line:84%
it means that the home of the
temple is in the city of Braga.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
horse's mouth again.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And still, at this
time, the Templars

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:08.440 align:middle line:84%
officially and historically
do not yet exist.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet so far we've been 36
minutes into his presentation,

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and we've proved
completely otherwise.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Amazing how sometimes you
have to look at the facts just

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to show how sometimes orthodox
history can be challenged just

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.610 align:middle line:90%
based on the facts itself.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's fast forward the
story 10 years to Jerusalem.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:84%
1125, the year when the Templars
suddenly grew very suspiciously

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.550 align:middle line:90%
active on Temple Mount.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Something happened, they
began to scurry around

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.610 align:middle line:84%
like headless chickens getting
things together, packing bags

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.290 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly disappearing.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Hugues de Payens, the Templar
Grand Master, and this Prior

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Arnolde, of the
Order of Sion, again,

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.390 align:middle line:84%
had been working together
on some undisclosed project.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Because on May the 2nd
the Feast of Beltane,

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.970 align:middle line:84%
they co-sign yet
another document

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:03.220 align:middle line:84%
in which the two
leaders yet again pledge

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:84%
good relations between their
respective brotherhoods.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.210 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, one
group of knights

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.270 align:middle line:84%
returns to the
French territories.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And they are carrying
with them an object

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of such extraordinary
value and importance

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.372 align:middle line:84%
that it requires
protection from the church.

00:44:18.372 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And they are given
this protection.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And it eventually goes
into the town of Troyes.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It disappears into the
county of Champagne.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And after that, it
disappears from sight.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely goes underground.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Some say it reappears in
the Cathedral of Chartres.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.520 align:middle line:84%
We are not too far from
the time when the cathedral

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.737 align:middle line:84%
itself was rebuilt.
And there is actually

00:44:38.737 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:84%
in one of the pillars, one
of the doors of the initiates

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.840 align:middle line:84%
in the northwestern
quadrant of the building

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.830 align:middle line:84%
a pillar which
everybody misses which

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.250 align:middle line:84%
does show a very well
crafted design which

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.610 align:middle line:84%
shows the Ark of the Covenant
being lifted by a rope

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.810 align:middle line:90%
by several people.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.393 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be ascending
a ladder going up to heaven.

00:44:57.393 --> 00:44:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
mysterious symbols you'll

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.140 align:middle line:90%
find in Chartres Cathedral.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.142 align:middle line:84%
So this may have
been something to do

00:45:03.142 --> 00:45:04.350 align:middle line:90%
with the Ark of the Covenant.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.940 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Prior Arnoldo also
suddenly becomes

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:12.280 align:middle line:84%
suspiciously absent from
Mount Sion, just disappears.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Goes AWOL, as do a second
group of Templar Knights which

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.590 align:middle line:84%
are dispatched to the
county of Portucale.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:84%
They take up residence
in the city of Braga.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And they begin receiving
massive amounts of land grants

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:90%
and other property donations.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.910 align:middle line:84%
People literally were
just handing them

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.380 align:middle line:84%
over property left,
right, and center.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And most of the bills of
sale still exist today.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.000 align:middle line:84%
You just got to know
where to find them.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So writing about this previously
unknown historical event,

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.350 align:middle line:84%
one chronicler actually
states about this event,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:47.460 align:middle line:84%
the grandmaster dispatched
several knights with the powers

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.730 align:middle line:90%
to establish a Portuguese crown.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Bang, right there.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the knights
was called Guilherme,

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.370 align:middle line:90%
who supervised the others.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
title and the power

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of procurators of the
temple which they exercised

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
in due course, as
many writers agree,

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.800 align:middle line:84%
while the order sought
to establish a home

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.320 align:middle line:90%
and proceed as planned.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.150 align:middle line:90%
This is an actual document.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:10%
And here are the names
of these five people

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:10%
that were sent on this
clandestine mission

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.840 align:middle line:10%
to this county on the
opposite side of Europe

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.080 align:middle line:10%
that's never taken place, ever.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.640 align:middle line:84%
If you've never
seen a smoking gun,

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.010 align:middle line:90%
this is what it looks like.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Thank god for all those days
scurrying through Harvard

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:90%
looking at animal skin.

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, the
group of nine men,

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.260 align:middle line:84%
they discovered something
of enormous value.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And they began setting
up the framework

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.060 align:middle line:84%
for a secure territory
on where to place it.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And they did this on the
extreme edge of Europe

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and as far from
the Vatican group

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.680 align:middle line:84%
as was possible back
in the 12th century.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They want to make sure that
what was put there was totally

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.720 align:middle line:90%
in safe hands.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what happens
next in this exciting story.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.150 align:middle line:84%
In order to keep track of
what the Templars were up to.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
The pope decided to
convene a famous council

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:90%
in the town of Troyes.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a very quiet
little town in France.

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Not much goes on.

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Because think about
it at the time,

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.360 align:middle line:84%
the church basically
runs the show.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:23.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't do anything in Europe
without the church's authority

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.750 align:middle line:84%
or in the church
knowing about it.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Their henchmen are everywhere.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.740 align:middle line:90%
They've got spies everywhere.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars are
pretty shrewd people.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they were damn clever
because they figured out,

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.508 align:middle line:90%
we can't fight the church.

00:47:36.508 --> 00:47:38.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
them lip service.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.540 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we need
to do what we have to do.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Because what we found
is of such importance

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that we can't let the church
get their mitts on this stuff.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So what do we do if
you're a Buddhist?

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, as any Buddhist
philosophy will tell you,

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.700 align:middle line:84%
with both arms wrapped
around your enemy,

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.040 align:middle line:90%
your enemy can't fight you.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So they actually approach
the pope and say, papa,

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.680 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
convene a little council?

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And we'll kind of bring
you in on what we know.

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And the pope says, hey,
that's a great idea.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Finally we get to find
out what these guys have

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:10.515 align:middle line:90%
been doing on Temple Mount.

00:48:10.515 --> 00:48:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, the
spies can't figure out

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.950 align:middle line:84%
what's going on because
well, the Templars aren't

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:15.750 align:middle line:90%
doing any fighting.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.083 align:middle line:90%
They're not protecting pilgrims.

00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And what the hell
are they doing?

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So the church is totally
keen on finding out what

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.800 align:middle line:90%
the Templars have been up to.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So they convene the
council in Troyes.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Which as it turns out
was very fortuitous,

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.990 align:middle line:84%
because it happens to be in
the same town that is actually

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.600 align:middle line:84%
run and owned by one of
the leading Templar Knights

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.480 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.890 align:middle line:84%
They're right in the middle of
Templar territory in France.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Right in the heart
of the lion's mouth.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.870 align:middle line:84%
The council is attended by
all the key Templar figures,

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:middle line:90%
including Hugues de Payens.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the end and like I
said, the items on the agenda

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.640 align:middle line:90%
were much more important.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.800 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea about
sanctioning the knight

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and saying [SPEAKING LATIN]
to the Templars

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.740 align:middle line:84%
was about the fifth
item on the agenda.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Very low on the radar,
it's as if the pope said,

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.110 align:middle line:84%
we're not really
interested in that.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, of course you're
damn well interested.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.860 align:middle line:84%
You just convened this council
in the middle of nowhere

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.603 align:middle line:84%
to find out what the
Templars were doing.

00:49:10.603 --> 00:49:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Of course you're interested.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:14.560 align:middle line:84%
You're just pretending
that you're not interested.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So this was a very smart
move by the Templars

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:84%
because basically they didn't
want to alienate the church.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to create the
public PR exercise to give them

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.460 align:middle line:90%
the blessing.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And once they had the
blessing of the church,

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.690 align:middle line:84%
they can quietly go
about their business

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.430 align:middle line:90%
by just providing lip service.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the fun part.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.880 align:middle line:84%
While all of this kerfuffle
is taking place over

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.940 align:middle line:84%
in Troyes in France, the
other five Templars who

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.610 align:middle line:84%
had gone to Portucale
clandestinely,

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:46.340 align:middle line:84%
they're busy assisting the late
Count Henry's son, Alfonso.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.228 align:middle line:90%
And here he is.

00:49:47.228 --> 00:49:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what you can
do with modern cameras.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Here's a photograph taken
from the 12th century.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:55.210 align:middle line:90%
I love this digital technology.

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So they're assisting
the late Count's son,

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Alfonso in removing what's
left of the Spanish and Moorish

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:06.850 align:middle line:84%
troops from what essentially was
occupied Portuguese territory

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and paving the way to establish
the independence of Portugal.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And they do this.

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.120 align:middle line:84%
They succeed within a couple of
weeks of the Council of Troyes.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.430 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing was
already in forward motion

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:21.580 align:middle line:84%
while the council itself
is already taking place.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
For them, it was just
an icing on the cake.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.270 align:middle line:84%
They were over here already
carrying out their little plan.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And proof that the
Templars were directly

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:33.010 align:middle line:84%
involved in the creation
of this first nation state

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.100 align:middle line:84%
is actually written
on the very charter

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.880 align:middle line:90%
of Portugal's independence.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.720 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.080 align:middle line:84%
There have been suspicions
for a long, long time

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that Prince Alfonso was
himself a Templar Knight.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.240 align:middle line:84%
They just couldn't
quite prove it.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was always
described as being,

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "Greatly
obligated to members

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Order of the
Knights Templar."

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Now this kid was
barely 17 years of age.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:00.670 align:middle line:84%
How does someone
this young become

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.520 align:middle line:84%
so obligated to a
group of knights,

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and foreign knights at
that from 2,000 miles away?

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.600 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a connection
going on here for him

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.200 align:middle line:84%
to have that kind of obligation
to these Templar Knights.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a close
look at the actual charter

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.847 align:middle line:90%
of Portugal's independence.

00:51:18.847 --> 00:51:20.680 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
wording, it is actually

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.120 align:middle line:84%
awarded to the
Templars themselves.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very
strange thing to do.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.980 align:middle line:84%
You just cleared all of
these invading troops

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:28.030 align:middle line:90%
out of this territory.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:29.440 align:middle line:90%
You've got your land.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.525 align:middle line:84%
And you've basically
awarded it to the Templars.

00:51:34.525 --> 00:51:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is from a king
who had been fighting

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.600 align:middle line:90%
this protected war for decades.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
wording on the charter,

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.298 align:middle line:90%
it reveals everything.

00:51:42.298 --> 00:51:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Because he's addressing
the Templars.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the prince says,

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I make this donation not
by force or by persuasion

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.900 align:middle line:84%
but for the love of God,
and for the good of my soul

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and for the cordial love
that I have for you.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And because within
your brotherhood

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and in all your
works, I am a brother.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.690 align:middle line:84%
He let the cat right
out of the bag.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.790 align:middle line:90%
He was himself a Templar Knight.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was indoctrinated in
secrets several years earlier.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And just to make
sure you also got

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.990 align:middle line:84%
the point, the
unmistakable Templar logo,

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.060 align:middle line:84%
the original Templar
logo is imprinted

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.540 align:middle line:84%
on the first charter of the
independence of Portugal.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.530 align:middle line:90%
What a great story.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
what we have so far.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.010 align:middle line:90%
I told you it was complicated.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:33.807 align:middle line:84%
But like all good things, you've
got to work at this, you know.

00:52:33.807 --> 00:52:35.140 align:middle line:90%
You should try reading the book.

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:36.848 align:middle line:84%
It'll will give you
a hell of a headache.

00:52:36.848 --> 00:52:39.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's like
800 references in this.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.610 align:middle line:84%
It's done something to
my short-term memory.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:45.390 align:middle line:84%
The follow up book
to this was easy.

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of took about
three weeks to write it.

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.875 align:middle line:90%
This was difficult.

00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:52.375 align:middle line:84%
Well, without giving
you a spoiler--

00:52:52.375 --> 00:52:55.200 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.340 align:middle line:90%
how should I describe this--

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the gift of the entire story
is in the last paragraph.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you're an
Aries, and I know you,

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.980 align:middle line:90%
do not go to the last paragraph.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It will ruin the
entire book, OK?

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.228 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know your
astrological signs.

00:53:12.228 --> 00:53:14.020 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know who
you're working with.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Aries, I'm going to go right
to the back of the book.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find out
what it's all about.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:17.860 align:middle line:90%
It will ruin it.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take you
right to the very end.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:20.455 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to suffer.

00:53:20.455 --> 00:53:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
be so much fun.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.230 align:middle line:90%
There's always a good reward.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Nothing comes easy.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.610 align:middle line:90%
So this is what we have so far.

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:31.210 align:middle line:84%
We have the Templars
embedded in Portugal a decade

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.300 align:middle line:84%
before they historically
appear on temple mound.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And the best part, they have
one of their own members

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.560 align:middle line:90%
on the throne of Portugal.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty good
work for 30 years.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We have Prior Arnolde,
this mysterious figure

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that no one ever talks
about in history,

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:48.230 align:middle line:84%
previously unknown
Templar Knight,

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Head of the Order of Sion.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:52.220 align:middle line:84%
He's working with the
Templar grandmaster.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.010 align:middle line:84%
He's arranging
properties and alliances

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that lead to the
creation of Portugal

00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:59.210 align:middle line:90%
as Europe's first nation state.

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We're talking here about
a patient plan that took

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.060 align:middle line:90%
over two decades to complete.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.560 align:middle line:90%
They were in no hurry.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.130 align:middle line:84%
They had all the
time in the world.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a patient plan.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:10.730 align:middle line:84%
They want to make
sure that whatever

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:14.390 align:middle line:84%
was done was done
elegantly and successfully.

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:19.020 align:middle line:84%
They were not going to fudge
this in any way possible.

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So now all of this brings up a
couple of very big questions.

00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:25.910 align:middle line:10%
Why would you create a country
from scratch and as far

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.640 align:middle line:10%
from Rome as possible?

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.160 align:middle line:10%
Again, to reiterate, the
church is afraid of two things,

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.030 align:middle line:10%
one was this evidence that
the holy bloodline exists.

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.072 align:middle line:10%
Let me quickly just sort
of go into the concept

00:54:38.072 --> 00:54:39.530 align:middle line:10%
of holy bloodline
because it really

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.240 align:middle line:10%
is beyond the scope
of this lecture.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And indeed beyond the
scope of my research.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.550 align:middle line:84%
That really goes
over to the writers

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:49.130 align:middle line:84%
of "Holy Blood,
Holy Grail," who've

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:51.950 align:middle line:84%
also suffered for bringing out
this information by the way.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And they took it on the chin.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Well done group.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like Graham
Hancock, he takes it for us,

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and then we just
quietly go behind him.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Very useful guy,
lovely friend as well.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.520 align:middle line:84%
The holy bloodline can
be dated all the way back

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.480 align:middle line:84%
to the house of Troy which may
come as a bit of a surprise.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
what, 4,000 years?

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.152 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:15.152 --> 00:55:17.360 align:middle line:84%
At the time of the Trojan
wars when the house of Troy

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:21.743 align:middle line:84%
lost to the Greeks, this
bloodline apparently split.

00:55:21.743 --> 00:55:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think about it,
that makes a lot of good sense.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:27.530 align:middle line:84%
If you have something as
powerful as a sacred bloodline

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:31.607 align:middle line:84%
of divinely guided
priest-kings and queens,

00:55:31.607 --> 00:55:32.690 align:middle line:90%
if you are being attacked.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And you've lost
the fight, you want

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to split what left you have of
your account into two segments.

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't want them to be
found in the same place.

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So the bloodline splits up, just
to make sure it is protected.

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of this bloodline makes
its way around the Aegean.

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:52.770 align:middle line:90%
It goes through Crete.

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:55.753 align:middle line:84%
It goes around the
bottom of the Aegean.

00:55:55.753 --> 00:55:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It goes through
the Mediterranean,

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.430 align:middle line:90%
the bottom of Sicily.

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:00.428 align:middle line:84%
Part of it goes
through central Europe.

00:56:00.428 --> 00:56:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But the rest takes
a ship all the way

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:05.300 align:middle line:84%
around the coast of
the Atlantic to a place

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:09.290 align:middle line:84%
called Braga which is
ironically the place where

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.930 align:middle line:84%
the Templars 3,000 years
later just happened

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.450 align:middle line:90%
to end up as well.

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a big clue right there.

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And after they settled in
Braga for an unspecified time,

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:21.080 align:middle line:84%
they then moved to the
south of England to a town

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.740 align:middle line:84%
called Totnes where there is a
natural mound, which apparently

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.730 align:middle line:84%
they built. And then they
moved to a city which

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:32.420 align:middle line:84%
was back then a small area
that was governed by the Welsh

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:37.590 align:middle line:84%
called Lundein, which today
we know as the city of London.

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So the city of London,
and it was basically

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.890 align:middle line:84%
co-founded by the
Welsh and the Trojans.

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.383 align:middle line:90%
Not many people know that.

00:56:44.383 --> 00:56:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
this suggestion

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that part of the
divine bloodline

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.850 align:middle line:90%
is being protected in Britain.

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.352 align:middle line:84%
The other side of this story
is that the bloodline went

00:56:52.352 --> 00:56:54.560 align:middle line:84%
through the house of David
and it stayed in Palestine

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and near east.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:57:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Eventually this bloodline
emerges in the Merovingian line

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.380 align:middle line:84%
of kings and queens in
the center of Europe,

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:06.710 align:middle line:90%
and particularly in France.

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:10.160 align:middle line:84%
This bloodline was deposed
by a very fierce coup

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.510 align:middle line:84%
by another group called
the Carolingians.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I hope you're keeping
track of all this.

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.790 align:middle line:90%
My head hurts.

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Can I be excused?

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:21.530 align:middle line:90%


00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:25.490 align:middle line:84%
By the Carolingians-- and it is
this dynasty that to this day

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:27.800 align:middle line:90%
has been running most of France.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting, because
these are the Kings that

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:31.320 align:middle line:90%
were backed by the church.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So the church appears to have
known that this bloodline did

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.340 align:middle line:84%
survive because they were
fundamental in backing up

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.190 align:middle line:84%
the group that deposed
the Merovingians.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:42.303 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is where it gets fun.

00:57:42.303 --> 00:57:44.470 align:middle line:84%
How does all of this relate
to Portugal and the fact

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that the church was concerned
about a holy bloodline that may

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.020 align:middle line:90%
have gone to Portugal as well?

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:54.317 align:middle line:84%
This was where Harvard
comes in very handy.

00:57:54.317 --> 00:57:55.400 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't looking for this.

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I had no intention of going
anywhere near a holy bloodline.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That's something for
people who can afford

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:01.910 align:middle line:90%
to hire research assistants.

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.430 align:middle line:90%
That's not me.

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Or people who actually
work at Harvard.

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And I begged them.

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:09.260 align:middle line:90%
I was literally on my knees.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And somehow by the grace
of some mysterious force,

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.280 align:middle line:84%
they let me in, and I
found this huge book.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was classic
television stuff.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.440 align:middle line:90%
They brought it down.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:23.180 align:middle line:84%
They have a little
lift, sorry elevator.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been here 14 years, I
still can't speak American.

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:31.865 align:middle line:84%
An elevator-- and you
get your gloves ready.

00:58:31.865 --> 00:58:33.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like, oh,
this is going to be meaty.

00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:35.830 align:middle line:90%
And the little bell goes bing.

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:36.830 align:middle line:90%
And two people come out.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And they bring this
huge book out, thick

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.762 align:middle line:90%
covered with leather.

00:58:42.762 --> 00:58:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And it takes two people
to bring it over.

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:46.173 align:middle line:90%
And they plunk it on your desk.

00:58:46.173 --> 00:58:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And people are turning
around going, um.

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.113 align:middle line:90%


00:58:50.113 --> 00:58:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, oh, you
don't need gloves for this.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:52.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:54.087 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's written
on animal skin.

00:58:54.087 --> 00:58:56.210 align:middle line:84%
The wax actually helps
preserve the paper.

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.830 align:middle line:90%
You think, you're kidding me.

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And imagine, as you're sitting
there turning this huge book,

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're touching the
corners, hopefully not poisoned.

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I've watched "The
Name of the Rose."

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.430 align:middle line:90%


00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.380 align:middle line:84%
You're actually touching
the darkened corners

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:17.270 align:middle line:84%
of pages that were handwritten
by monks 900 years ago.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:20.930 align:middle line:84%
That's an incredible
thing for someone to do.

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:23.577 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there reading
this in medieval Portuguese,

00:59:23.577 --> 00:59:24.410 align:middle line:90%
which is slow going.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can read Portuguese,
medieval Portuguese.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.520 align:middle line:90%
You've got to take it slowly.

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they put
commas everywhere.

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:32.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're in
no hurry like we are.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Like, they don't have apps.

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:37.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, they go,
and so it came forth,

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and the first time of
the time of so-and-so,

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.680 align:middle line:84%
who is a daughter of
so-and-so, in the county of--

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.520 align:middle line:90%
get to the point.

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.940 align:middle line:90%
And there's no index.

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And all I'm doing is
looking for a couple

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.120 align:middle line:84%
of pieces of information
that will validate

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.920 align:middle line:90%
something I've already found.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:56.057 align:middle line:84%
By the time I get to page 680,
I'm going, this is riveting.

00:59:56.057 --> 00:59:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where this is going
but it has no bearing on what

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing, but holy mother.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a rare document in
the middle of this book.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:09.508 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying something
like in the middle of Harvard.

01:00:09.508 --> 01:00:10.550 align:middle line:90%
And people turned around.

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.548 align:middle line:90%
And I went, sorry.

01:00:13.548 --> 01:00:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I was really quite embarrassed.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't behave like
that in one of the highest

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:19.130 align:middle line:90%
seats of learning.

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:20.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm misbehaving quite badly.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting very excited.

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:26.330 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that this book
written by the Cistercian monks

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
actually has the indoctrination
ceremony for every new Templars

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.480 align:middle line:90%
master in Portugal.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.030 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know this existed.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.060 align:middle line:90%
It was a complete fluke.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
reading this article.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual
phrase that the candidate

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:47.030 align:middle line:84%
swore when they became the new
Templar masters in Portugal.

01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was,
they didn't actually

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.070 align:middle line:84%
swear allegiance to the
Templar brotherhood itself.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
They swore allegiance to
the Cistercian brotherhood.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, because the
Cistercians and the Templars

01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:01.140 align:middle line:90%
were in fact the same people.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of the monks
had come from the Cistercian

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:05.410 align:middle line:90%
monastery to begin with.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
They were all handpicked
by Bernard of Clairvaux.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But here's the wonderful
section in this actual phrase

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that the Templar master had to
utter in front of this crowd.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:21.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, I declare a vow to
protect the bloodline of David.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, why include this line item
unless there was a bloodline

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.130 align:middle line:90%
to protect in Portugal?

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
bell suddenly went off.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's one big
reason why you set up

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.190 align:middle line:84%
a country on the
other side of Europe

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
because this is
anathema to the church.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
If they knew that there was a
bloodline here, you're a goner.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.200 align:middle line:90%
So there is this subtle idea.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I have not been able
to find out any more

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.440 align:middle line:90%
information about this.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it is beyond
the scope of this lecture

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:49.130 align:middle line:90%
to go on about the bloodline.

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:52.820 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that after
Alfonso gives 1/3 of his country

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to the Templars, his
own particular family

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:57.560 align:middle line:90%
takes a split.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
They form a side, a splinter
group called the House of Aviz,

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
or Avis.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe nothing to do with
the car rental company.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But to this very day
they still exist.

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they exist not
far from where I was born.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And they had the Templar
logo with the Fleur-de-lis

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
on it which is a symbol
of the divine bloodline.

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So there is a suggestion that
somewhere in Portugal there

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
is a hint of part of
that divine bloodline.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be me.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I could own land.

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
There may be a queen
waiting to marry me.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.810 align:middle line:90%
A rich tall woman.

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I just thought about that.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.330 align:middle line:90%
This could be quite--

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:37.690 align:middle line:84%
woo, do I have to
keep doing this?

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Can I go home now?

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing that
the church was afraid of,

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
this bloodline and
why the Templars maybe

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.543 align:middle line:84%
built this territory on
the other side of Europe.

01:02:47.543 --> 01:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that they
were concerned about was--

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.320 align:middle line:90%
in fact, they were paranoid--

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
was that people would
uncover its bogus claim

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.370 align:middle line:90%
on Jesus' ministry.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And part of this bogus claim
was to do with the suppressed

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Gospels of Philip and
Thomas, which today you

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.990 align:middle line:90%
can buy in any bookstore.

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend you
do because they have

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
lots of meaty things in it.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Specifically Philip
is particularly

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:11.570 align:middle line:90%
damning about the church.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:15.680 align:middle line:84%
They talk about an imitation
church that usurped

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.780 align:middle line:90%
the true church of Christ.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And also other
interesting people

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.890 align:middle line:90%
who were involved in that group.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the particular
"Gospel of Philip,"

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
they were saying that if
you actually found out

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
what the true church was
doing, that you have actually

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
discovered the true meaning
behind the resurrection.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And Philip is particularly
poignant on this fact

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
because he says that the
resurrection was actually

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.450 align:middle line:90%
never meant to be a real event.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed
to be a metaphor.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It was always to do with a
secret ritual of initiation.

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
There was never a person
nailed to a cross.

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:52.850 align:middle line:84%
No one ever gets up from the
dead after they've been dead.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
It contravenes the
laws of nature.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And he says this in
the actual gospel.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back
to this in a second

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:02.010 align:middle line:90%
because it's very important.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But here is the
link because there

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
are a number of
clues that suggest

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:08.690 align:middle line:84%
the Templars themselves
were conducting this very

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:10.190 align:middle line:90%
heretical ritual.

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Because initiates that belong to
the inner Templar brotherhood--

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and there were two brotherhoods.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
There was an outer
brotherhood that

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
did things of a menial
nature like cook,

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:22.240 align:middle line:84%
clean, do things, fix
things, and sometimes they

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
were called on to
fight for protection.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Because you had to back
then otherwise you're dead.

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
This inner Templar
brotherhood, they

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
undertook a very secret
ritual which so many people

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:35.180 align:middle line:90%
seem to know about.

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they completed this
ritual, when they came out,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.560 align:middle line:90%
they were declared risen.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes risen
from the dead.

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Now it suggests
that the Templars

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.940 align:middle line:84%
or a group within the
Templars were practicing

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.250 align:middle line:90%
a mystical spirituality.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is implied
by the vow made

01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
by recruits who wanted to
be admitted into the Templar

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.300 align:middle line:90%
order.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
This is something else that
was discovered recently.

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, hiding in
plain sight, this

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
is what the recruits wishing
to join the order actually

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:06.590 align:middle line:90%
declared.

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:09.950 align:middle line:10%
I wishing to come to
the joys of paradise--

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:12.860 align:middle line:10%
a strange thing for
a warrior to say.

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.980 align:middle line:10%
I wishing to come to the
joys of paradise surrender

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.990 align:middle line:10%
my body and my soul to the
Lord God and the blessed Mary

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and the brothers of the
knighthood of the Temple

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:23.640 align:middle line:10%
of Solomon in Jerusalem.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Which begs the
question, why would

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:28.940 align:middle line:10%
becoming a warrior,
a fighting person

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.280 align:middle line:10%
bring you the joys of paradise?

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.290 align:middle line:10%
The two don't go together.

01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.180 align:middle line:10%
It's implying that
joining the Templars

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.510 align:middle line:10%
somehow came with a
promise that had with it

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:40.720 align:middle line:10%
a substantial spiritual benefit.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.270 align:middle line:10%
I mean, paradise
is something that's

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:44.253 align:middle line:10%
a highly attainable
spiritual goal.

01:05:44.253 --> 01:05:45.920 align:middle line:10%
And if you are into
the mystery schools,

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.830 align:middle line:10%
it's one of the highest levels
of initiation and experience

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:53.630 align:middle line:10%
that you can possibly
have when you're alive.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:56.780 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out this inner
brotherhood of the Templars

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.690 align:middle line:10%
did not behave like
knights at all, if ever,

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.190 align:middle line:10%
because they never
did any fighting.

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.607 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they went
around behaving

01:06:02.607 --> 01:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
much like a ministerial
college like real monks ought

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.620 align:middle line:90%
to be doing.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So wherever they made a
home in Europe, the knights

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
we're always
preoccupied with looking

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:16.042 align:middle line:90%
for ancient sacred sites.

01:06:16.042 --> 01:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So wherever they went
to France, wherever

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
they moved to England,
Scotland, Portugal, Spain,

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:23.600 align:middle line:84%
wherever they decided
to settle down,

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
they always chose an
ancient sacred site.

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking stone circles,
upright rocks, temples,

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:37.370 align:middle line:90%
caves carved out of rocks.

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, all of
these sites, almost 95%

01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
of the ones I've
been able to find

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
were exclusively dedicated
to a divine female deity,

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.070 align:middle line:90%
a divine virgin.

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Often ISIS or whatever her
regional doppelganger was.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, these knights,
these fighting knights

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.325 align:middle line:84%
were after something of
a very spiritual nature.

01:07:00.325 --> 01:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The next piece of evidence
in this trail of thought

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
actually comes from an article
in the secret Templar rule.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a special book
that was found literally quite

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
by accident on one of
the personal possessions

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of a knight that was
caught running away

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
from the holy inquisition,
and it concerns the rule

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
of the elected brothers.

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's article 7.

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And its oh, so juicy.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Here's what it says.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, here's
another smoking gun.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Build in your houses meeting
places that are large

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and hidden that can be
accessed by underground tunnels

01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:39.110 align:middle line:84%
so that the brothers can go
to meetings without the risk

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:41.210 align:middle line:90%
of getting into trouble.

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
In the houses of
unelected brothers,

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
it is prohibited to conduct
certain materials pertaining

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.190 align:middle line:84%
to the philosophical sciences,
or the transmutation of base

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:54.230 align:middle line:90%
metals into gold and silver.

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.810 align:middle line:90%


01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:58.070 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying.

01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
This should only be undertaken
in secret and hidden places.

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, I like it.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So a bunch of guys going
around fighting, talking about

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:11.750 align:middle line:90%
references to alchemy.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, spiritual
transfiguration,

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean these assumptions are
at the very core of the mystery

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:18.319 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:21.260 align:middle line:84%
In case you're not familiar,
and I'm sure all of us here are.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.649 align:middle line:84%
This transmutation of base
metals into gold and silver

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental
principle of any neophyte

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that comes into the
mysteries as a base metal.

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.500 align:middle line:84%
You're just an ordinary
human being, a bag of bones

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.189 align:middle line:90%
and some meat attached to it.

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you've
gone through the levels

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.890 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries and you've
come to know the mind of God,

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:42.979 align:middle line:84%
you have been transmuted
into a new type of metal.

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
You've been fashioned into a
article of gold and silver.

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:49.569 align:middle line:84%
And what that means,
another symbol, gold

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
is always representative
of the masculine self.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And silver is the feminine self.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.609 align:middle line:84%
So you've come to harmonize
through the teachings

01:08:57.609 --> 01:08:58.870 align:middle line:90%
your polar opposites.

01:08:58.870 --> 01:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Like the two knights
riding the horse,

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.279 align:middle line:84%
you have now united your
feminine and your masculine

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and now made into one.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.220 align:middle line:90%
You've become the single man.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just as Jesus
also himself stated,

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
only the single ones
can find paradise.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.819 align:middle line:84%
It answers that
particular question.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So someone here was trying to
keep something very, very quiet

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:20.920 align:middle line:90%
and secure from the clergy.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Least of all because the
final ritual of initiation

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:27.399 align:middle line:84%
within the Templar order
revolved the candidate being

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.800 align:middle line:90%
lifted from a figurative grave.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was described as
a living resurrection.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, where did the Templars
get such preposterous ideas?

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not that difficult
to figure out actually

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
because, yes,
separated at birth.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.529 align:middle line:84%
It has been noted by many
people how the Templars bear

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
a remarkable resemblance
to the beliefs, the rules,

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
the methods, even the
dress code of another bunch

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of interesting buggers
call the Essenes.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it doesn't translate
very well here.

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I better keep my Britishisms
to myself sometimes.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.358 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, a group of interesting
folk called the Essenes.

01:10:08.358 --> 01:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Essenes of
course were around

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years earlier
before the Templars,

01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:14.390 align:middle line:90%
not to confuse the two directly.

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
However, while in Jerusalem, the
Templars did become friendly--

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:19.240 align:middle line:90%
and this is known--

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.310 align:middle line:90%
with various esoteric groups.

01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
They became friends
of the Sufi, which is

01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:26.380 align:middle line:90%
the esoteric portion of Islam.

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting
people actually.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
They also got to know
the Sabians of Harran who

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
were very interested
in taking pilgrimages

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to the Great Pyramid because
they said that it helps

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.420 align:middle line:90%
us connect with the stars.

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
going there to have

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%
an out of body experience.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:43.322 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other story in itself.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But they were especially
keen on making friends

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
with a group called
the Mandaeans, who

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:51.588 align:middle line:84%
are very similar in all
ways to the Essenes.

01:10:51.588 --> 01:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
You're keeping track
of all of this, right?

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.070 align:middle line:90%


01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Words are very interesting.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Etymology is a wonderful
tool to have possession of.

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Mandaean comes from
a word called manda.

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And it literally translates
as, secret spiritual knowledge.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's a title.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Mandaean.

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It tells you
exactly who you are.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I possess secret
spiritual doctrine.

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:19.150 align:middle line:90%
I practice a spiritual truth.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And they followed-- and
still do to this very day--

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the Book of John which
apparently according

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.138 align:middle line:84%
to the church does
not exist because it

01:11:26.138 --> 01:11:27.430 align:middle line:90%
is written by John the Baptist.

01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And John the Baptist apparently
according to the church

01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:31.960 align:middle line:90%
never wrote the book.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you go and talk to
the Mandaeans today which

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
are a highly persecuted
sect in the south of Iraq,

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
they will show you the Book
of John to this very day.

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They're still
practicing the rules

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.675 align:middle line:84%
of their very spiritual
leader, John the Baptist.

01:11:45.675 --> 01:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't care
any about Jesus.

01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:49.510 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, he's
an important guy,

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.208 align:middle line:84%
but he really just
was not a major figure

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
in the bigger scheme of things.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, John the Baptist, he's
a very important person.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And they maintain
that to this very day.

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
We know this to be true
because in 1865 the extremely

01:12:03.190 --> 01:12:06.310 align:middle line:90%
debauched pope, Pope Pius IX.

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:07.330 align:middle line:90%
And I like this guy.

01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Because he just sat down
with a few pints of beer.

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And he just let the cat
out of the bag, one thing

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:14.747 align:middle line:90%
after another.

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you should see
some of his quotes.

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:18.850 align:middle line:90%


01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
This fable of Christ has
well profited our company.

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:27.630 align:middle line:90%


01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:30.680 align:middle line:84%
The church then came out
with its PR department,

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, no,
he didn't say that.

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:33.410 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say that.

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
He was just having
one of those moments.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
A week later they published
an eight page document

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.700 align:middle line:90%
saying what he hadn't said.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.482 align:middle line:90%
Just quit while you're ahead.

01:12:42.482 --> 01:12:44.690 align:middle line:84%
If he didn't say it, don't
publish an 8 page document

01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:46.710 align:middle line:90%
explaining what he didn't say.

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting a parental
sticker on an album.

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:50.220 align:middle line:90%
You're going to buy it.

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.220 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that they
would have learned by now.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that he
said was that he basically

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
accused the Templars
and their progeny,

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the Freemasons of
secretly being Johannites,

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:04.083 align:middle line:84%
that they had always paid
lip service to Catholicism.

01:13:04.083 --> 01:13:05.750 align:middle line:84%
They said they would
never follow Jesus.

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:08.167 align:middle line:84%
They never dedicated any of
their churches or sacred sites

01:13:08.167 --> 01:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%
to Jesus.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And they had been following
this secret Johannite doctrine

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.680 align:middle line:90%
all along.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So essentially in
the 19th century,

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
the church finally
issued a kind of fatwa

01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
on the Templars
and the Freemasons.

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't even make up
this stuff, it's so funny.

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So it now begs us
to ask the question,

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
why were the Templars following
John the Baptist and not Jesus?

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
What was so special
about John the Baptist?

01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, around 30 AD, both the
Essenes and the Mandaeans

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:38.510 align:middle line:90%
practiced a very secret ritual.

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And this was undertaken
by an inner brotherhood

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
who separated themselves
from an outer brotherhood.

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
This ritual to put
it in nuts and bolts

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
involved three
years of practice.

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:54.853 align:middle line:84%
You have to be tested for
well, responsibility, making

01:13:54.853 --> 01:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
sure that the
information that you

01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
were given because it was
secret and very important,

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that you could be
entrusted with it.

01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And that sorted out the
sheep from the elephants.

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
If you were able to
maintain your integrity

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
throughout these
three years, you

01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:11.132 align:middle line:84%
were then led to the
final level of initiation.

01:14:11.132 --> 01:14:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
you were taken down

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to a cave, a sarcophagus,
or a restricted chamber,

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:20.463 align:middle line:84%
and you had an induced
near death experience.

01:14:20.463 --> 01:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've written about this
in my new book, which I'm just

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.770 align:middle line:90%
giving you a paraphrase here.

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:26.880 align:middle line:90%
It's an extraordinary story.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And in this
near-death experience,

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
which is highly controlled
by priests and priestesses,

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.132 align:middle line:84%
and it was a great
responsibility.

01:14:33.132 --> 01:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think
about it, you're literally

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%
putting someone into a coma.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And you expect them to come back
into the body three days later.

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And during this time,
you've gone AWOL.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Your soul has gone
into the other world,

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
it is hanging around there
talking to spirits, discarded

01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
souls, gaining information,
extracting special knowledge

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and coming back totally
cognizant of this information

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:58.760 align:middle line:90%
about the mechanics of nature.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.860 align:middle line:90%
This is really important stuff.

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We're talking people who
practiced this later on,

01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
people like Plato, Pythagoras,
Isaac Newton, possibly even

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Leonardo da Vinci.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:12.380 align:middle line:84%
All of these people belong
to very similar sects.

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And even Plato declared
that this experience,

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.110 align:middle line:84%
this near-death living
resurrection experience, even

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
form and shape, his ideas on
philosophy and metaphysics,

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:24.620 align:middle line:84%
he has actually
written about this.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So they were conducting this
all over the place in secret.

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, the candidate
after three days of being

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.390 align:middle line:84%
in a coma comes
back into the body,

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
his soul comes in,
he's totally groggy.

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And she by the way, this
was also open to women.

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And they are taken out by the
priestesses or the priest,

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:45.090 align:middle line:84%
they are shown the morning
sun or the brightest star

01:15:45.090 --> 01:15:48.380 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon that morning
which would have been Sirius,

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.120 align:middle line:90%
the star of wisdom.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, they were
declared, raised from the dead.

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
people were practicing,

01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
the Mandaeans and
Essenes were practicing.

01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they were declared
risen from the dead,

01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:04.490 align:middle line:84%
because compared to the
uninitiated, the people who

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been exposed
to this other world,

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
they hadn't been exposed to the
creative force of the universe,

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
these people were walking
around life, going shopping,

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:14.238 align:middle line:84%
watching television,
clicking their apps,

01:16:14.238 --> 01:16:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were declared, the
dead, or the walking dead

01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:17.840 align:middle line:90%
as they called them as well.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.633 align:middle line:84%
So even back then
they had this issue

01:16:19.633 --> 01:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
with people who
were unenlightened

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:22.515 align:middle line:90%
and people who got it.

01:16:22.515 --> 01:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
We're still struggling
with this today.

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a perennial exercise.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And only the highest
adepts were allowed

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
to conduct and teach this
ceremony, as you can imagine.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge responsibility.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
This highest level of
initiation was entrusted only

01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:39.920 align:middle line:90%
to a few individuals.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And the ritual as I said, was
called the living resurrection.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And it came with a title.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
The title is going
to be quite shocking.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's called Nazari, right?

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:54.345 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the story,
Jesus of Nazareth.

01:16:54.345 --> 01:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't be further
from the truth.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Recent archeological
evidence shows

01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:02.210 align:middle line:84%
so far that Nazareth
back in Jesus' day,

01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
actually there wasn't much
there, there was a few hovels.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:05.960 align:middle line:90%
There's some caves.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the synagogue
in the Bible in Nazareth

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.070 align:middle line:90%
did even exist.

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Or at least it hasn't
been found yet.

01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps the story was
a little bit concocted.

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was misconceived.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the term Nazari did
exist back in Jesus' time.

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And it literally means a
keeper of special knowledge.

01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:27.822 align:middle line:84%
So two of the people that are
known by the Mandaeans who

01:17:27.822 --> 01:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
have been allowed to conduct
this living resurrection

01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:34.800 align:middle line:84%
ceremony were Jesus Christ
and John the Baptist.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
Jesus was a nazari.

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:38.200 align:middle line:90%
He didn't come from Nazareth.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.200 align:middle line:90%
He was an actual priest.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Now you know.

01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:43.440 align:middle line:90%
And I was raised as a Catholic.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.940 align:middle line:90%
This was pretty shocking stuff.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:48.100 align:middle line:90%


01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:51.930 align:middle line:84%
This ritual gave initiates
direct experience of God.

01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about this from
a nonreligious point of view

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:55.230 align:middle line:90%
now.

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a critical
step on the path of

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
self-realization and
self-empowerment, very

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.820 align:middle line:90%
heretical stuff back in the day.

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, such knowledge
could also be abused.

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it was
withheld from people outside

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
of the inner brotherhoods.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And the initiates, as
I mentioned earlier,

01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
they vowed to die rather
than reveal these secrets.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And of course, many
of them did, including

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.570 align:middle line:10%
of course, the priest-messiah
John the Baptist.

01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:24.990 align:middle line:10%
But not before he taught
the initiation practices

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:27.690 align:middle line:10%
to such people as
Mary of Bethany,

01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:31.410 align:middle line:10%
otherwise known as
Mary the Magdal Eder,

01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:35.143 align:middle line:10%
which means the
watcher of the flock.

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.310 align:middle line:90%
We know her by another name.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
She is of course,
Mary Magdalene.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's proved that
she was a priestess, who

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
also was part of the
initiation ceremonies

01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:46.260 align:middle line:84%
because her epitaph is the
woman who knew the ALL.

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:47.430 align:middle line:90%
That's the giveaway.

01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
She already understood
these secrets.

01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the
Templars dedicated

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.260 align:middle line:84%
virtually all of their sacred
sites to these two individuals

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
shows that they actually
followed their ministry.

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
In Catholicism, as
you know, both figures

01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
are very low on the radar
for a very good reason.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So proof that the
Templars were also

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
practicing the secret
mysteries under the tutelage

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.980 align:middle line:84%
of a divine virgin
lies in the code

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
of conduct written
for the Templars

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.330 align:middle line:90%
by Bernard of Clairvaux.

01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had
to swear an oath

01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
to uphold the
obedience of Bethany,

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:23.250 align:middle line:90%
the castle of Mary and Martha.

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:25.950 align:middle line:84%
This means that they are
upholding the house of Mary

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Magdala herself.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is very powerful stuff.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So while the church is
thinking that They've

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.230 align:middle line:84%
got the Templars under
control, the Templars

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:37.253 align:middle line:84%
are following the rule of
Mary Magdalene all along.

01:19:37.253 --> 01:19:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to
ask ourselves what

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:40.830 align:middle line:84%
was so dangerous about
these secret mysteries

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and why they became
outlawed by the church.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, these mysteries
were essential components

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric brotherhoods who
for over 3,000 years from China

01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt to the Andes
had practiced gnosis.

01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's a Greek name
meaning knowledge

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual mysteries.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a knowing
that comes not

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
just from specialized
information

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.580 align:middle line:90%
but from a wider perception.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Much like a Buddhist finds
an expanded awareness

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.770 align:middle line:90%
through meditation.

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the views held by
its practitioners including

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%
the Gnostic Christians--

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and there were gnostic
Christians by the way--

01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of how the universe
truly works differed

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.740 align:middle line:90%
from those of fundamentalists.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, these people did
not interpret the resurrection

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:26.970 align:middle line:90%
literally.

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Instead they insisted and
recognized the human condition

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.560 align:middle line:90%
for what it is.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual death.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
reborn in the world

01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:36.720 align:middle line:90%
to understand how things work.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Because for them,
the resurrection

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.910 align:middle line:84%
is the moment a person
discovers enlightenment.

01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And the suppressed
Gospel of Philip

01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
makes this distinction
very clear.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And he writes in
this banned gospel,

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
those who say they
will die first

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and then rise are in error.

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.910 align:middle line:84%
They must receive the
resurrection while they live.

01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Susanna.

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic Christians
went even so far as

01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:03.120 align:middle line:84%
to call the literal
view of Jesus' death

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.200 align:middle line:84%
the faith of fools,
actual quote.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And anyone believing
the church's version

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
of resurrection was
confusing a spiritual truth

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.230 align:middle line:90%
with an actual event.

01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And the ritual that culminated
in the initiate being risen

01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
from the dead was conducted
in special temples

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and underground chambers
located at the confluence

01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's
electromagnetic energies.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And this required a
specialized knowledge

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.400 align:middle line:90%
of the mechanics of nature.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And such an understanding
gave the initiate

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
a degree of control over
their out of body experience.

01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians
already knew about this.

01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:39.030 align:middle line:90%
They called it, hecka.

01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:41.400 align:middle line:10%
It means magical power.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.430 align:middle line:10%
And derived from this magical
power is the word "heckel."

01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:46.230 align:middle line:10%
which is temple.

01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:49.170 align:middle line:10%
And since ancient
temples without exception

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:53.250 align:middle line:10%
are placed at the confluence of
the Earth's telluric currents,

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.240 align:middle line:10%
or the dragon lines,
or the serpent lines

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.970 align:middle line:10%
if you want to call them that.

01:21:56.970 --> 01:22:00.850 align:middle line:10%
This formerly links a sacred
site with Earth energy

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:02.820 align:middle line:10%
and the magical
power one receives

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.010 align:middle line:10%
from such an interaction.

01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:middle line:10%
So what the Egyptians and
other ancient cultures

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:12.270 align:middle line:10%
were hinting at is that by a
specially designed building,

01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:15.930 align:middle line:10%
when placed upon the
Earth's telluric currents

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:18.300 align:middle line:10%
generates an environment
for a shamanic

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.630 align:middle line:10%
but controlled out
of body experience.

01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:middle line:10%
And that is capable of
transforming a person

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.960 align:middle line:10%
on a spiritual level.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.460 align:middle line:10%
And if been to sacred
sites as much as I do,

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.160 align:middle line:10%
you'll understand this
is absolutely correct.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.520 align:middle line:10%
Here's a simple example.

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.130 align:middle line:10%
Let's give you a bit
of science behind this.

01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:35.380 align:middle line:10%
This is not a diagram.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:38.770 align:middle line:10%
This is an actual map of
a magnetometer survey.

01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:41.380 align:middle line:10%
A magnetometer is a kind
of a big awkward machine

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.960 align:middle line:10%
that you drag along the ground
to find electromagnetism

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.120 align:middle line:10%
on the ground.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:50.980 align:middle line:10%
And it shows the Rollright
stone circle in the UK

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:54.670 align:middle line:10%
and how it actually attracts
a magnetic line of the Earth's

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:56.860 align:middle line:10%
telluric currents
into the entrance.

01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.870 align:middle line:10%
And look at how it
behaves like the rabbit

01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:00.700 align:middle line:10%
hole in "Alice in Wonderland."

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
It clearly shows,
and many examples

01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:05.830 align:middle line:84%
like it, that the sacred
sites are attracting

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:07.300 align:middle line:90%
the Earth's energy currents.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And they are doing so for
a very important reason.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars were well
aware of the relationship

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.100 align:middle line:84%
between their body, a
geometrically designed

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
building, and
electromagnetic hotspots.

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever they
went, they either rebuilt

01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:23.440 align:middle line:84%
the ancient sacred sites
or they deliberately

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.410 align:middle line:84%
chose locations known
for their telluric energy

01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to build their own, such
as this important building

01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:31.360 align:middle line:90%
in the town of Thamara.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
This rotunda marks
the confluence

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
of these two invisible yet
measurable pathways of energy.

01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And the paths to this
very day around this tower

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
are actually marked by
effigies around the building.

01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
You just have to know
the symbols to look for.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you're patient,
the symbols are there.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
These are electromagnetic
forces which occur naturally,

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:54.220 align:middle line:84%
together where
they're harnessing

01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
within a geometric
space is now known

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to have a profound
effect on a person's

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.190 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So it is this interaction
between magic,

01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
the temple, and the
mind that begins

01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
the process of activating
the body's sensory organs

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately leads to
an out of body experience.

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
The method is consistent with
ancient ritual initiation

01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:19.840 align:middle line:84%
around the world from
Arizona to the Andes.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.100 align:middle line:90%
And you heard that correctly.

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:24.730 align:middle line:84%
They are still doing this
in the kivas in Arizona.

01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you recall, the
Templars spent years on a quest

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
to discover a treasure
on the Temple Mount.

01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:33.580 align:middle line:84%
They were rich men who
gave up their wealth

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to dig in hot and
putrid conditions.

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Clearly money was
not the motivation.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.290 align:middle line:10%
And what they found
were texts outlining

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:45.850 align:middle line:10%
specific shamanic practices
that allowed a direct experience

01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:48.730 align:middle line:10%
of God, the one
practice that undermined

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:50.950 align:middle line:10%
the purpose of the church.

01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:53.590 align:middle line:10%
Evidence proves the texts
were of an alchemical nature.

01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:56.770 align:middle line:10%
Because in 1121, they
were sent across Europe

01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:58.600 align:middle line:10%
to Lambert de Saint-Omer.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.090 align:middle line:10%
Not only was he a
cryptographer who

01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:02.680 align:middle line:10%
uncovered the secrets
of these texts,

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.770 align:middle line:10%
he was also a
Cabalist, or Cabalist.

01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And the art of
kabbalah literally

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
means the understanding
of the science

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.400 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit body of god.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand
the spirit body of god,

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
you know about the
forces of creation.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:19.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why this stuff
is very important.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars were
offering a direct experience

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.890 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:26.320 align:middle line:84%
They were offering the
salvation of the soul, not

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.700 align:middle line:90%
the catholic church.

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
everyone in Europe

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
was falling over themselves
to hand over property and soul

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:34.510 align:middle line:90%
to these few knights.

01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And we know this because
during the polite questioning

01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
by the inquisition,
the informants

01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:42.010 align:middle line:84%
revealed that the
Templars did indeed

01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:44.170 align:middle line:84%
perform secret
rituals, one of which

01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:46.630 align:middle line:84%
involved initiates
being resurrected

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:49.240 align:middle line:90%
from a figurative grave.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The in the Templar brotherhood
was indoctrinated people

01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
into the ritual of living
resurrection and giving them

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
a taste of paradise exactly
as the inner people coming

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
into the brotherhood
were asking to find.

01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, they were
reenacting the very same ritual

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.270 align:middle line:90%
practiced in Egypt in 2,600 BC.

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's written on the walls
of an underground chamber

01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:16.720 align:middle line:84%
in the Pyramid of Unas, where
the body of the actual pharaoh

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.860 align:middle line:90%
was not found in that place.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But when you read the
actual transcripts,

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.230 align:middle line:84%
it shows that this person
left the body alive

01:26:23.230 --> 01:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was expected for
the soul to come back

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.560 align:middle line:90%
into the living body.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.870 align:middle line:84%
That's been discovered
in the last few years.

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So we know that they
were practicing it

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
because their progeny,
the Freemasons,

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
are still figuratively
performing this ritual today.

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know this if anyone
here is a third-degree Mason.

01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in
the third degree?

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.800 align:middle line:10%
The candidate is
risen figuratively

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.530 align:middle line:10%
from a grave, brought upwards.

01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:49.630 align:middle line:10%
The blindfold removed
because the information

01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:51.520 align:middle line:10%
has been received has
made them enlightened.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.820 align:middle line:10%
And now they can see.

01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:53.940 align:middle line:10%
They are no longer blind.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.870 align:middle line:10%
They are no longer dead.

01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:58.197 align:middle line:10%
So it's a lot to think about.

01:26:58.197 --> 01:27:00.280 align:middle line:10%
When we come back, we're
going to change the story

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.330 align:middle line:10%
a little bit slightly.

01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So just to bring us
back down to Earth.

01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I suggest you undertake
lots of liquid refreshment.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.830 align:middle line:10%
I'll see you in a half an hour.

01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:12.880 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:19.424 align:middle line:90%
